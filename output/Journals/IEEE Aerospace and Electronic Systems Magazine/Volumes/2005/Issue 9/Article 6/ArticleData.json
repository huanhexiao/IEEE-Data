Nonreal-time systems store the information, and forward it to destination later, usually by means of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Nowadays the main application of these systems is small data exchange to/from remote sites where no other communication infrastructure is available, hence, covering a niche market. Low on-board memory storage capability and, moreover, low bit rate due to little bandwidth allocated for these systems do not allow us to collect and forward a considerable volume of data in the short visibility window of the satellite passage. New applications and services can be conceived through the deployment of new systems able to overcome the above-described limitations, while existing applications can be provided more cost-effectively. These aspects are addressed together with an experimental interactive system which allows huge data collection in W-band and for forwarding to the Internet.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "Sept. 2005", "inspec": "8583636", "date": "Sept. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 03 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "9", "pages": "25 - 29", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
