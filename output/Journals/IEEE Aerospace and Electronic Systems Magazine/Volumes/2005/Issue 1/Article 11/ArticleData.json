A navigation-and-controlling system aboard a hydrographic vessel GS-439 was used to provide the fulfillment of the task. The results of the sea trials of control problems are given. They have shown rather good accuracy of the ship track-keeping on a preset system of straight tacks and on a preset route as well as the efficiency of automatic ship passing to the first tack and passing over to the next tacks in surveying the seabed relief, using a multi-channel echo sounder", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "27", "date_publication": "Jan. 2005", "inspec": "8297171", "date": "Jan. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 28 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "1", "pages": "25 - 27", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["S.
