The completed tasks support the government's objective of a \"realizable and operationally feasible\" US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) concept of operations. This paper provides an overview of the operational improvements for the command and control of satellites, the provision of safe, precise navigation and timing services to end-users. The GPS III system changes existing operational paradigms. Improved operator capabilities are enabled by a new high-speed uplink/downlink and crosslink communication architecture. Continuous connectivity allows operators a \"contact one satellite - contact all satellites\" concept enabling near-real-time navigation updates and telemetry monitoring. This paper describes potential improvements for the following operations: constellation monitoring, command and control, navigation upload monitoring, global service monitoring, global service prediction, civilian navigation (CNAV) messaging, and anomaly detection and resolution. This paper also describes future operational improvements as GPS applications continue to proliferate and the need for an improved infrastructure to effectively manage all the systems that affect GPS service grows", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "10", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "Jan. 2005", "inspec": "8297169", "date": "Jan. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 28 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "1", "pages": "10 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["O.
