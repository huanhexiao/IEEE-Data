The Global Information Grid (GIG) enables net-centric operations. The purpose of the GIG is to provide end users real-time or near-real-time access to multiple information sources ranging from airborne/satellite/ground sensors (video imagery and processed visual information/data) to databases. The end users in an aircraft view and interact with this information through the human system interface (HSI) or \"smart\" displays. The information is transmitted across a Gigabit Ethernet on-board the aircraft that interfaces with multiple channels of a software programmable radio that acts as a hub in the GIG network, or on-board sensors and processors. This paper presents the mandated capabilities, and the processes involved in determination of upgrades needed to achieve net-centric operations.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "Dec. 2005", "inspec": "8709637", "date": "Dec. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "12", "pages": "3 - 8", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["E.
