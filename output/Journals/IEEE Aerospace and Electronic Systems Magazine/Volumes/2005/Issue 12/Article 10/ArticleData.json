Most aviation software, due to the possible life-threatening consequences of failures, is subjected to intense testing. Frequently, this results in generation of enormous unorganized raw data files. Such data needs to be further processed and analyzed to get a meaningful insight into potential problem areas with the software. In this paper, we present the results of our study on designing and implementing a test management system specifically designed for testing aviation software. The paper has three major contributions. First, we present a survey of existing work. Second, we discuss the design for a test data management system, TDMS. Finally, we discuss some implementation issues encountered during the TDMS development.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "20", "date_publication": "Dec. 2005", "inspec": "8709639", "date": "Dec. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "12", "pages": "15 - 20", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
