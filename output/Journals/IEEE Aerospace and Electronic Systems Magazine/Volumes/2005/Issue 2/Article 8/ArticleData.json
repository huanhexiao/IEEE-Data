A practical way of implementing the scheme has been discussed and the results found to be encouraging. New spike suppression (SS). Window function has also been suggested for obtaining low side lobe levels and to suppress spikes in phase shift keying spectrums that exists at high bit rate data transmission. The characteristics such as low side lobe levels and spike elimination have been achieved using new techniques that are essential for space applications", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "16", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "20", "date_publication": "Feb. 2005", "inspec": "8297176", "date": "Feb. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 28 00:00:00 EST 2005", "issue": "2", "pages": "16 - 20", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
