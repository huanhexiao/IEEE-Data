This will show the strengths and weaknesses of existing test system architectures including rack and stack systems with GPIB instruments and modular systems like VXI and PXI. It will provide a glimpse into an emerging new architecture: LAN-based test systems. The paper reviews key concerns such as costs, channel counts, footprints, IO speeds, ease-of-integration, and flexibility. The objective of the paper is to provide engineers insight into the most effective test systems for their future applications.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "32", "date_publication": "May 2005", "inspec": "8448834", "date": "May 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon May 23 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "5", "pages": "27 - 32", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["G.
