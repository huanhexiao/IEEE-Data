This system has been developed and installed for access control to one of our laboratories. Experimental results reveal that the system is working fine and no special cleaning requirements or components replacement is needed. It can support more than 50 users, and an average of 74.5 access attempts per day in a 14-hour, 5-day-per-week working. Emphasis is also given on some important facts to be taken into consideration when comparing and evaluating different products from different vendors.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "20", "date_publication": "June 2005", "inspec": "8472900", "date": "June 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 20 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "6", "pages": "18 - 20", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
