Ubiquitous access to the Internet has become an essential component of a mobile workforce, and multiple mechanisms are being devised to ensure seamless connectivity to corporate resources. An integrated security framework requires careful consideration of the security features of the network within an airplane. Potentially, the aircraft could consist of three kinds of networks, namely: passenger network, crew network, and control network. The security protocol implemented must ensure a proper separation of these networks and also watch for any security protocol violations. In this paper, the authors review existing aircraft data network standards, security provisioning, and security threats associated with the aircraft data networks. In addition, the authors also analyze the security threats associated with different network architectures.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "June 2005", "inspec": "8472897", "date": "June 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 20 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "6", "pages": "3 - 8", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["N.
