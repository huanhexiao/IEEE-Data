Probably this is one of the oldest biometric recognition methods, with high legal acceptance. Technological advances have made possible new perspectives for signature recognition, by means of capturing devices which provide more than the simple signature image: pressure, acceleration, etc., making it even more difficult to forge a signature.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "28", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "32", "date_publication": "July 2005", "inspec": "8591866", "date": "July 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 22 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "7", "pages": "28 - 32", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
