VIY-2 GPR combines all units (synchronizer, transmitting and receiving modules, powering, and antenna system) into single case. The VIY-2 GPR communicates with computer via standard interface RS232 or USB1.0. Technical solutions utilized by the VIY-2 GPR reduce deployment time and simplify surveying process. The VIY-2 GPR design features and its components interaction are considered at this paper. Some field results are also presented here. The VIY-2 GPR design concept allows reducing the data acquisition time,, optimizing the time-varying gain control function, applying depth-stacking dependence, controlling the surveying window position and interference reducing by pulse repetition frequency randomizing.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "16", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "July 2005", "inspec": "8591863", "date": "July 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 22 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "7", "pages": "16 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["V.
