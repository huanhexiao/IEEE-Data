The sensor with the trademarked name \"MICROTRACK\" is similar to the \"MICROPOINT\" fence sensor with precise detection location, sensitivity leveling, and free format zoning. Intruder location is accomplished with low-power ultra wideband frequency stepped radar driving the sensor cables. Target range resolution also allows the use of sensitivity leveling for each individual range bin. This will compensate for differences in soil conductivity along the length of the cable and for metal objects, which may be located in the near field radiation. The design of the MICROTRACK sensor was presented at the 2002 Carnahan Conference in Atlantic City. It has been described as FM-CW radar, however it differs from the generic form in that the frequency is stepped rather than continuously swept and phase code modulation is added to discriminate against interference. The wide bandwidth of the MICROTRACK sensor fills in the s typical of a single frequency radar and provides a more uniform field profile along the entire length of the sensor cables. This describes the testing that has been performed to characterize the system for different environmental conditions. Southwest Microwave, Inc. has procured an open field site of 31 acres of flat desert land for testing the buried cable. Another site in Canada is used for testing with an additional set of weather and soil conditions. Detection patterns, proximity to stationary objects, and various environmental factors will be discussed. Extensive measurements of both electric and magnetic fields along the length and perpendicular to the sensor cables show a detailed map of the multiple frequency surface wave. When the cables are buried, the uniformity of the field is degraded slightly but no deep s are observed. Site testing has confirmed major benefits of the MICROTRACK sensor: - Uniform Detection Zone - Elimination of Deep Nulls - Precise Target Location - Sensitivity Leveling.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "15", "date_publication": "July 2005", "inspec": "8591862", "date": "July 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 22 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "7", "pages": "11 - 15", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
