Improvised bistatic measurements at 77GHz are discussed and second order Doppler effects studied. Complex Doppler returns, consisting of two or more Doppler contributions, are decomposed and studied using empirical methods. In particular, ground illumination techniques are used to study Doppler in the shadow region of a cylinder of circumference 81 wavelengths. It is concluded that the complex Doppler response from the spinning cylinder consists of both direct (first order) and delayed (second order) Doppler components. Further measurements are proposed to study the delayed Doppler effect further.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "27", "date_publication": "July 2005", "inspec": "8591865", "date": "July 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 22 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "7", "pages": "21 - 27", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
