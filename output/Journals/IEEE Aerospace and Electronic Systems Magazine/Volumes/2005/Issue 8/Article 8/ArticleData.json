The major problem Is that this undertaking is both time-consuming and expensive. With budgets decreasing, program managers have to find innovative ways to do more with less. To find those innovative ways, we must look at non-traditional methods of TPS development. We must be willing to consider that there are alternate solutions, and we must take them Into consideration when making a decision on which ATS to re-host our TPSs. This paper will discuss one of the alternative solutions to re-hosting TPSs that will realize significant savings in both time and money over the use of traditional ATS. Specifically we will talk about using an in circuit test system (PinPoint II from DiagaoSYS Systems, Inc.) to re-host digital circuit boards from a legacy ATS and the techniques used to accomplish this task. This approach is not intended to fit all situations, but in the right situation, it can be very effective. To get the most out of this approach, it is important to identify exactly which TPSs: are good candidates, and which are not. To illustrate how this can be done, the process used by the AWACS program to find a cost-effective way of re-hosting TPSs from their obsolete depot tester (AN/GSM-285) will be outlined. The outline will describe the criteria used to determine which circuit cards are good candidates, and the differences in techniques used with this approach compared to traditional TPS development. It will also describe the limitations as well as the benefits obtained by using this approach. Examples will be given that illustrate the cost savings that can be realized over the use of traditional ATS.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "16", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "Aug. 2005", "inspec": "8601181", "date": "Aug. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 22 00:00:00 EDT 2005", "issue": "8", "pages": "16 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
