The first is a Printrak AFIS 2000 system with a database of more than 450,000 fingerprints, while the second is a NEC AFIS 21 SAID NT-LEXS Release 2.4.4 with a database of more than 15 million fingerprints. Our Experiments reveal that, although both systems can manage inkless fingerprints, the latest one offers better experimental results.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "17", "date_publication": "April 2005", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 09 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "13 - 17", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Marcos Faundez-Zanuy"], "keywords": [], "arnumber": "7035262"}
