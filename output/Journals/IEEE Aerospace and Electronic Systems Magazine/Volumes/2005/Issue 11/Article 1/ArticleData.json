It describes landing at the lunar sites and methods of communicating data to and from Earth via comsats or a relay station on the Earth-side. The paper suggests a sequential construction of the sensor array, power supply, and communication equipment. It describes the likely revisits to the sites for periodic maintenance. The observatory is technically feasible and awaits a detailed design study to site the lunar equipment and choose among several alternatives, for example; the location of the array, the power supply and the communication channels. An Earth command center will be needed to archive and distribute data to principal investigators.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "Nov. 2005", "inspec": "8738009", "date": "Nov. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "11", "pages": "15 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
