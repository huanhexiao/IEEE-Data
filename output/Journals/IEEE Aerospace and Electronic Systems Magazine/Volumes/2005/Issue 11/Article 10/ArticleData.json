One of its advantages is the high social acceptance by users, because it does not have the criminal stigma associated to other biometric traits, such as fingerprints. In addition, the cost of a webcam can be below 20 USD, which is certainly lower than other biometric acquisition devices. For this reason, the authors have developed a low-cost door-opening system, which is installed in our university premises for lab control access.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "Nov. 2005", "inspec": "8738011", "date": "Nov. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "11", "pages": "23 - 26", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
