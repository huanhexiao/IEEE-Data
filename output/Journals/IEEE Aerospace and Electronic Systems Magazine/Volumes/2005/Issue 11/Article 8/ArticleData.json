Data communications are a key component in achieving the aviation-related operational performance improvements that are sought. However, data communication doesn't start when you get into the aircraft; it starts back at the location where the flight is planned. In fact, data communications support the pilot in all phases of the flight: flight planning, pre-flight, departure, en route, transition, approach, landing, and rollout as well as for a missed approach. The Internet is being used to perform flight planning activities, and the mobile communications available today support Internet access en route to the departure airfield. On-board the aircraft, data communications provide surveillance and air traffic control (ATC) support to the pilot. The location of other aircraft is available to the pilot and ATC system through automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) and traffic information service-broadcast (TIS-B) applications that transmit the location of other aircraft in the vicinity. Other aircraft locations are used to forecast potential conflicts and, thus, enhance flight safety. As the aircraft nears a SATS-equipped airfield, the pilot uses data link messages to request a landing sequence. The airport management module (AMM) provides a landing sequence assignment to the aircraft. As the pilot maneuvers the aircraft for a landing, he/she is using data-linked surveillance data to determine the location of other aircraft and maintain a safe separation distance between aircraft even in a low visibility environment.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "14", "date_publication": "Nov. 2005", "inspec": "8738008", "date": "Nov. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "11", "pages": "9 - 14", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["T.
