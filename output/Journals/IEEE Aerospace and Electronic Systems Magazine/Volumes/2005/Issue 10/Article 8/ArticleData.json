This will enable the implementation of innovative and advanced services and applications closer to the user's needs. In this framework, the road sector is one of the major potential markets for GNSS applications and, therefore, it is very promising for future EGNOS and GALILEO related applications. Satellite navigation receivers are now commonly installed in cars as a key tool for proving new services to people on the move such as electronic charging, real-time traffic information, emergency calls, route guidance, fleet management, or advance driving assistance systems. Specifically, a very important commercial opportunity is represented by the tolling-related applications. This paper describes the Vehicular Remote Tolling (VeRT) Project sponsored by Galileo Joint Undertaking (GJU) and performed in the frame of the first GJU Call under the EC VI Framework Programme. The overall design of the service provision architecture is also presented in this paper, together with the main topics related to the following activities focused on the service prototype demonstrator development.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "Oct. 2005", "inspec": "8618163", "date": "Oct. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "10", "pages": "3 - 8", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
