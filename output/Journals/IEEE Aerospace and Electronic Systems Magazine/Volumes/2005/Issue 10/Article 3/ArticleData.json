To insure adequate communication coverage at relocated new location, the link margin for the Extravehicular Activity (EVA) astronauts and between Space Shuttle Orbiter and International Space Station (SSO-ISS) during rendezvous were analyzed. The multipath effects from the vehicle structures surrounding the antenna were investigated. The Radio Frequency (RF) electromagnetic radiation to the Orbiter Docking System (ODS) pyrotechnics was also analyzed to ensure the EMC/EMI compliances.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "14", "date_publication": "Oct. 2005", "inspec": "8618164", "date": "Oct. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "10", "pages": "9 - 14", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["S.
