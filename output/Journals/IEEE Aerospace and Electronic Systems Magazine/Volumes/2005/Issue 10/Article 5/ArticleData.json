Modern methods of detection and exclusion of anomaly measurements, main matters of de-noising the measurement and multiresolution analysis of the signals based on wavelet transforms, are considered. Wavelet tools for analysis of measurements results are implemented by SEC SPbSETU in data processing program complexes, developed for the use at Russian trial space-launching sites. Practical capabilities of wavelet technology will be demonstrated by applied program, installed in the note-book PC for processing of GPS/GLONASS raw measurements.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "Oct. 2005", "inspec": "8618167", "date": "Oct. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "10", "pages": "25 - 28", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["V.
