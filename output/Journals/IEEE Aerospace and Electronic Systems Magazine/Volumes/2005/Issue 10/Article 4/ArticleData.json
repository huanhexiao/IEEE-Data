The radars developed include 95- and 36-GHz cloud radars and an airborne, Ku-band SAR radar system. They are capable to perform real-time, high-resolution measurements. The set-up of these instruments, the novel technical solutions, and the signal processing technique introduced are discussed. The results obtained with such instruments during measurement campaigns are presented as well.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "Oct. 2005", "inspec": "8618166", "date": "Oct. 2005", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "10", "pages": "19 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
