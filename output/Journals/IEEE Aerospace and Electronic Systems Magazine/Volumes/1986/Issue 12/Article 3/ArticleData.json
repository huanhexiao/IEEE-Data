The pilot controls the operation of this system by entering an MSL altitude and manually arming the system. Engagement conditions of the auto-recovery maneuver are controlled by aircraft speed, altitude, attitude, and the set recovery altitude and do not depend upon any determination of pilot physiological condition. Initiation of the recovery maneuver is preceded by visual and aural warnings which continue until the pilot resumes control. The pilot always has the capability to override or disengage the autorecovery maneuver. This system, as developed on the AFTI/F-16, is directly and quickly applicable to other analog or digital flight control systems such as found in the F-16 or F-18. This system provides the pilot protection from ground collision in most air-to-air training environments.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "19", "date_publication": "Dec. 1986", "date": "Dec. 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "12", "pages": "13 - 19", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["John D.
