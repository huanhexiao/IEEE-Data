A recently completed study has examined the operational requirements and assessed current and near term technology for an answer to this need. The Landing Systems Requirements/Synthesis Study has defined the Pilot/vehicle Interface and imaging sensor suite required, based on the concept of augmenting pilot forward vision with sensor imagery and guidance symbology on a HUD during low visibility landings. Image processing technology was also assessed for potential enhancement of the information presented to the pilot. This paper summarizes the final report of the Study, which is in publication.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "10", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "15", "date_publication": "May 1986", "date": "May 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "5", "pages": "10 - 15", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Edmond F.
