The MLS will be capable of providing precision landing guidance down to Category III minimum while allowing for complex approach paths in both the horizontal and vertical planes. The system is based on the Time Reference Scanning Beam (TRSB) technique which was selected by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in April 1978 as the new international landing system standard. MLS is less susceptible to interference from the surrounding area and provides a greater signal coverage area than ILS.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "6", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "9", "date_publication": "May 1986", "date": "May 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "5", "pages": "6 - 9", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Thomas E.
