In late 1983, NASA initiated the integrated Digital/Electric Aicrat (IDEA) study programs to determine the impact of extensive use of advanced electrical and digital systems on future aircraft. The first objective of the IDEA program was the broad evaluation of improvements in airplane performance and economics resulting from the integrated introduction of digital controls and advanced electrical systems. The second program objective was the definition of research and development areas required to achieve the projected improvements. A baseline configuration was compared to the new IDEA configurations in terms of economic performance, fuel efficiency, and significant system and airplane configuration characteristics. Important factors (weight, reliability, maintainability, cost, performance, survivability, and environmental constraints) were determined and compared to form the basis for recommending the research and development necessary to implement IDEA concepts. Based on these developmental needs, research programs were recommended for high-risk, high-payoff areas appropriate for implementation under NASA leadership. The 1990 Baseline configuration represents a 6% to 8% fuel burn improvement over current technology. When compared to the 1990 Baseline airplane, the IDEA airplane systems showed a 1.8% improvement in direct operating cost (DOC) and a 3% improvement in fuel burn performance. In addition, significant economic improvement was apparent when the total operating cost was included.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "20", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "Jan. 1986", "date": "Jan. 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "1", "pages": "20 - 23", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Gordon E.
