A brief mission narrative is provided describing seveal hours in the life of the Manta air superiority fighter. This is followed by a discussion of the pilot interface components employed in the cockpit including hueristic voice, instrument panel display, canopy display, and holographic display systems. The concept of a ``symbionic'' system is then introduced, describing in some detail the capabilities and features of a cockpit system that senses the physiological and mental state of the pilot and responds accrodingly. Finally, conclusions and predictions are made that summarize and emphasize the points made in the paper.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "24", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "27", "date_publication": "Jan. 1986", "date": "Jan. 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "1", "pages": "24 - 27", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["John M.
