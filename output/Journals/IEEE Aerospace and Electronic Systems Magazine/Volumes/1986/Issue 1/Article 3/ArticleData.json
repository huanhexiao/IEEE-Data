This integrated avionics system will use significant increases in computer automation with more innovative signal processing, sensor fusion and expert system software to reduce pilot workload, while improving total system performance and reliability. Expert system software packages will be implemented within the core architecture of these next generation integrated avionics systems to assist the pilot. The expert systems will consider the pertinent information available from the ``sensor'' subsystems to assess the current situation. The expert systems then consult their knowledge base and rule base software structures to determine alternative reactions to the perceived situation. Then pending upon the critical of the function, situation and reaction, the expert system could either execute the most favorable reaction or display the suggested alternative courses of action to the pilot. This paper addresses the requirement, the enabling technologies and the potential structure of this next generation of avionics. It concludes with two examples of the potential of future avionics expert systems. The two examples are 1) A Navigation and Route Planning Expert and 2) A Threat Assessment and Threat Reaction Expert. Significant things are happening in technology at an accelerating pace that enable the development of this new generation of avionics.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "19", "date_publication": "Jan. 1986", "date": "Jan. 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "1", "pages": "13 - 19", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Ken Frankovich", "Ken Pedersen", "Stanley Bernsteen"], "keywords": ["Aerospace electronics", "Application software", "Automation", "Expert systems", "Fusion power generation", "Hardware", "Sensor fusion", "Signal processing", "Software performance", "Software systems", ""], "arnumber": "5004941"}
