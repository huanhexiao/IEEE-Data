This system issues horizontal and vertical resolution advisories, and should give fewer unnecessary alarms than earlier systems. Design tradeoffs and new techniques are described for threat detection, modeling of potential escape maneuvers, and the selection of resolution advisories. Plans for further development and evaluation are described.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "7", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "Jan. 1986", "date": "Jan. 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "1", "pages": "7 - 12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["W.
