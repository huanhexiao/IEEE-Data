Through the development and understanding of these reference models of nations, and the understanding of their use in national decision-making, it should be possible to use more effectively the methodology of systems, man, and cybernetics to help bring about a more peaceful world in which cooperative security among nations is possible.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "6", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "13", "date_publication": "Aug. 1986", "date": "Aug. 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "8", "pages": "6 - 13", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Harold Chestnut"], "keywords": ["Computer security", "Controllability", "Cybernetics", "Data security", "Decision making", "Demography", "Finance", "National security", "Process control", "Production", ""], "arnumber": "5005175"}
