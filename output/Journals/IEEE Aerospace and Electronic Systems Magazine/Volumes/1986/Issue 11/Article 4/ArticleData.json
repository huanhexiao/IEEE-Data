Information was obtained through personal visits to a limited number of software facilities and by utilizing a SQA questionnaire that was mailed to 27 DoD software organizations. Twenty questionnaires were returned from Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force organizations involved in the Life Cycle Software Support (LCSS) process. The survey developed information regarding such topics as: staffing; personnel qualifications; quality standards used; SQA responsibilities; error data collection; adequacy of existing documentation; staff composition; distribution of SQA effort; and workforce mix. In addition, a list of SQA ``Lessons Learned'' was developed from comments made by DoD quality managers. The results of this study indicate a wide variance in the application of SQA within the DoD.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "Nov. 1986", "date": "Nov. 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "11", "pages": "21 - 26", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Raymond Day", "Thomas McVey"], "keywords": ["Computer errors", "Documentation", "Information management", "Quality assurance", "Software maintenance", "Software quality", "Software standards", ""], "arnumber": "5004993"}
