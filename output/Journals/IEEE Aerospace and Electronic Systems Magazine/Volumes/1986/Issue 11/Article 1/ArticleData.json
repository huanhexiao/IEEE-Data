Multimedia documents are composed of text, image, voice, and attribute information. We describe the multimedia document structure, their internal representation and their presentation form. Content addressibility in this environment is achieved by specifying conditions on attributes, text, images, and document presentation form. Query reformulation, multimedia document formation in this environment and communication with the outside world are also discussed. Archived documents are stored in a centralized server. Users submit their queries in their local workstations using a local area network. The server retrieves the qualifying documents and returns them to the users. We analyze the performance of various access methods for multimedia documents that reside in the server.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "2", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "9", "date_publication": "Nov. 1986", "date": "Nov. 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "11", "pages": "2 - 9", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["S.
