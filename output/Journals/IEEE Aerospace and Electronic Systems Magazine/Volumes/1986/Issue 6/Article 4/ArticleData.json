Evolution is extended from the past 100 years to the end of the 20th century with the identification of several likely crises precipitatory to World War III. Systems theoretic interpretation of a number of evolutionary developments is made. The use of systems concepts and systems experts in the management of international stability is discussed further.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "June 1986", "date": "June 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "6", "pages": "13 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Kenyon B.
