The major finding from this Conference was the lack of integration of those technologies which are part of the diagnostic process. Since that time, much has been done to implement the concept of integrated diagnostics. The NSIA has produced a baseline report on the implementation of the concept. This was followed by a series of Service programs aimed at implementation. The Office of the Secretary of Defense considers solutions to the diagnostic problem to be one of its major R&D goals. This paper discusses the progress made during the last three years on the implementation of integrated diagnostics. The paper also discusses the author's ideas on where the program is going.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "2", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "5", "date_publication": "June 1986", "date": "June 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "6", "pages": "2 - 5", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["George W.
