Preventive maintenance is normally associated with mechanical equipment, and requires prognostic maintenance techniques to predict failures before they occur. Corrective maintenance is more closely associated with electronic equipment, and requires diagnostic maintenance techniques to detect and isolate failures after they occur. To pursue a systems approach to weapon system maintenance using both prognostics and diagnostics, the Air Force has initiated a program entitled, ``Generic Integrated Maintenance Diagnostics (GIMADs)''. This paper provides insight into the GIMADS program at Aeronautical Systems Division.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "June 1986", "date": "June 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "6", "pages": "9 - 12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Harry M.
