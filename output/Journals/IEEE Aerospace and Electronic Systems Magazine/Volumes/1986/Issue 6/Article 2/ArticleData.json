This System is composed of a number of diagnostic design tools, which are aimed at automating the diagnostic design process. When completed, the tools will be utilized in a comprehensive integrated diagnostic demonstration project applied to a Naval weapon system. The last three years have been characterized by increasing attention given to the definition, implementation, and evaluation of integrated diagnostics concepts. Integrated diagnostics is a structured process which maximizes the effectiveness of diagnostics by integrating pertinent elements, such as testability, automatic and manual testing, training, maintenance aiding, personnel and computer-aided engineering as a means for providing a cost-effective capability to detect and unambiguously isolate all faults known or expected to occur in weapon systems and equipment, and to satisfy weapon system mission requirements.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "6", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "9", "date_publication": "June 1986", "date": "June 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "6", "pages": "6 - 9", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Michael Battaglia"], "keywords": ["Automatic testing", "Design engineering", "Information analysis", "Logistics", "Maintenance engineering", "Personnel", "Process design", "Research and development", "US Department of Defense", "Weapons", ""], "arnumber": "5005131"}
