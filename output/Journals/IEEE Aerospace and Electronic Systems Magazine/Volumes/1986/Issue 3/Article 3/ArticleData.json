These vehicles were designed and fabricated, and are operated by the Flight Research Department of Calspan Corporation, Buffalo, New York. These unique aircraft have been used to develop control laws and control systems, to evaluate new aircraft before first flight, to provide specialized training for test pilots, to perform essential flight research in flying and handling qualities, and to develop and validate the military specifications for handling qualitites of piloted airplanes. As aircraft and control systems have become more complex and capable, systems integration issues have required more and more effort and resources.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "10", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "March 1986", "date": "March 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "3", "pages": "10 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Jack Barry", "Arno E.
