This paper classifies a variety of techniques for increasing frequency spectrum utilization. Next, it is clarified that our proposed ``new channel assignment algorithm'' is more efficient than other algorithms through simulation analysis.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "5", "date_publication": "March 1986", "date": "March 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "3", "pages": "1 - 5", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["H.
