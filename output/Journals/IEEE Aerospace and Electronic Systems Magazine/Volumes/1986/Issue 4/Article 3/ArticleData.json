Until now these ever more demanding requirements have been met by costly customized stores management system designs. GEC Avionics has surveyed the potential SMS requirements of a comprehensive range of aircraft and weapon types, in order to define a universal SMS design concept based on system availability, integrity and reliability, operational functions, peripheral interfaces and maintenance/human factors. This advanced concept not only includes provision for all existing weapon types but also has growth potential for the evolving MIL-STD-1760 weapon interfaces. System interface requirements have been rationalized in order to achieve a Modular Stores Management System (MSMS) design based on major factors such as cost, mission requirements and customer specifications. The key work for a successful MSMS design is flexibility and GEC Avionics has evolved a set of standard modules which can be packaged to satisfy specific customer needs. Typically, the standard modules provide over 80% of the hardware in every Stores Management application. The MSM concept features much reduced development costs and timescales, commonality between aircraft types minimizing parts inventory, VLSI technology providing high reliability and a common product support and maintenance philosophy. The MSM design offers a highly cost effective low risk concept for meeting the needs of modernization and new aircraft programs.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "April 1986", "date": "April 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "4", "pages": "11 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Clive J.
