They are being installed in a large variety of vehicles both of domestic and of foreign manufacture. In this paper we discuss the physical, climatic, and electronic environments which cellular telephones may expect to encounter in nationwide service. We also discuss procedures used to evaluate the ability of a cellular phone to operate without failure in these environments and to avoid interfering with the increasingly complex vehicular electronic systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "31", "date_publication": "April 1986", "date": "April 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "4", "pages": "27 - 31", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Nathan Ehrlich", "William Sperber"], "keywords": ["Batteries", "Electric shock", "Electromagnetic compatibility", "Manufacturing", "Power system transients", "Road vehicles", "Sea measurements", "Telephony", "Vibration measurement", "Voltage", ""], "arnumber": "5005091"}
