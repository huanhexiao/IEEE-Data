To simplify the design effort required to protect electronic equipment and minimize overlapping transient requirements and qualification tests, unified test requirements and procedures are needed. The goal of these unified test procedures would be to insure a known susceptibility level for each newly designed electronic Line Replaceable Unit (LRU). Ten avionics equipments in current Air Force inventory were tested for the purpose of developing unified procedure test methods. Operating LRUs were subjected to transients using common mode cable current (CMCC), groung potentials and chatteriing relay cable injection methods. Based on observed test results and review of current test requirements, test methods and test levels for unified test procedures for power-on transient tests of avionics equipment have been formulated.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "April 1986", "date": "April 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "4", "pages": "17 - 26", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["George W.
