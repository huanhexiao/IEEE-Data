A conceptualized interface among the pilots, mental models, and human information technologies is proposed wherein knowledge concerning human cognition is meshed with the capabilities and limitations of artificial intelligence (AI). Necessarily, a different way of looking at the pilot's role in the intelligent cockpit is developed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "6", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "Sept. 1986", "date": "Sept. 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "9", "pages": "6 - 12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Michael D.
