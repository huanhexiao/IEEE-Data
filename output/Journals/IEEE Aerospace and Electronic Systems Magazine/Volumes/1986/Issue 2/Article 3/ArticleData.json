This paper discusses the utilization of two expert systems for handling multisensor data fusion and situation assessment. In multisensor data fusion, each sensor operates over a different region of the surveillance volume asynchronously and provides different measurements. In some instances, more than one sensor may yield the same measurement but with a different measurement accuracy. In this regard, the paper describes, in layman's terms, a system block diagram for processing the autonomous sensor track files and the possible need for a ``smart'' fusion processor. This expert system is shown to manage the sensor outputs in both the temporal and spatial domains to maximize target identification confidence as well as kinematic state vector accuracy. The paper delineates the features needed by the fusion expert in order to assign a quality factor to each composite track file entry. A second expert system uses the output from fusion and other mission-related data to formulate the best picture of the surveillance volume at hand. This second expert system will show how historical data and real-time sensor data are merged for purposes of display parameters to the pilot, weapon cueing, countermeasures response management, and feedback to the fusion expert processor for individual sensor communication and data collection direction. The paper concludes with a tabular summary of the subprocesses of which these two expert systems may consist.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "12", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Feb. 1986", "date": "Feb. 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "2", "pages": "12 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Ronald M.
