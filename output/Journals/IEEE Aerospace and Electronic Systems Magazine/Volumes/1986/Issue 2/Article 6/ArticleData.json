Future cockpits will incorporate a wide range of enhancements. Heavy application of artificial intelligence techniques can be expected to encompass the entire spectrum of crew station technologies; from data fusion, to optimized display resource management, to real-time onboard maintenance and fault reporting, and even to the optimization of pilot physiological needs. Emphasis on exploiting applications of the ultimate human resource, the mind, can be expected through the use of biocybernetics; initially to control previously manual and/or automated cockpit functions, and eventually to allow bidirectional communications. Future enhancements can also be expected to improve aircrew performance by allowing the pilot to take full advantage of aircraft maneuvering capability, and to operate effectively in hostile chemical, biological and radiological environments. New high resolution, full color, three dimensional crew station display devices will complement enlarged sensor suites and enhance aircrew situational awareness. Does the pilot really need to see the outside world to fly and fight effectively? Or, can panoramic display techniques, in an encapsulated environment, coupled with 4\u00c2\u00bf steradian sensor coverage, increase performance? This paper strives to illustrate some ``no holds barred'' approaches to making future fighter cockpits an ``in-tune'' extension of the operator, based on current and projected tactical needs.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "20", "date_publication": "Feb. 1986", "date": "Feb. 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "2", "pages": "17 - 20", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Paul I.
