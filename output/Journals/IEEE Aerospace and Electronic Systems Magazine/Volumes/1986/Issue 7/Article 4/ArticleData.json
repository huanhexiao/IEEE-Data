DORIS performs two major tasks: one as an expert consultant to the end-user, and second as an aid to the knowledge engineer via knowledge acquisition tools. DORIS is coded in LISP without third party expert system development tools. System features include a user-friendly interface, knowledge bases, forward and backward chaining inference systems, an explanation system, and a rule maintenance system. DORIS has been applied as a prototype in two areas: fault diagnosis of a Serial Digital Multiplex Assembly, and procedrual control for navigational sequencing.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "21", "date_publication": "July 1986", "date": "July 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "7", "pages": "18 - 21", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Kathleen Davis"], "keywords": ["Artificial intelligence", "Control systems", "Diagnostic expert systems", "Expert systems", "Fault diagnosis", "Humans", "Intelligent systems", "Knowledge acquisition", "Knowledge engineering", "System testing", ""], "arnumber": "5005156"}
