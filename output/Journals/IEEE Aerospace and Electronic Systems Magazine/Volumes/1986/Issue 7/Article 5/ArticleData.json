The LDA is a knowledge-based computer program (an \"expert system\") that designs digital electronic circuits. The LDA extends existing CAD/CAE capabilities by providing a computer aid to the design process, supplementing those that assist the drafting, layout, and simulation processes. It seeks to ensure that appropriate testability (and in the future, other \"ility\") features are incorporated during the earliest stages of design in accord with the guidelines defined for Integrated Diagnostics. We discuss issues relevant to the engineering development of other knowledge-based tools needed for Integrated Diagnostics including tool selection and choice of knowledge representation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "22", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "July 1986", "date": "July 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "7", "pages": "22 - 26", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Leonard Moskowitz"], "keywords": ["Circuit simulation", "Computational modeling", "Computer aided engineering", "Design automation", "Diagnostic expert systems", "Electronic circuits", "Linear discriminant analysis", "Logic design", "Process design", "Technical drawing", ""], "arnumber": "5005157"}
