The development of the organization, and operation of the program for the collection and dissemination of this information is discussed. Information is presented on the expansion of the program beyond the original military and aerospace organizations to now include commercial-industrial organizations as well. A description of the four major data banks and the types of data interchanged is provided to identify the electronics oriented data on discrete components, hybrid microcircuits, interconnection and packaging techniques, reliability evaluation, failure analysis, materials, and manufacturing processes. This information can be used to build reliability into electronics. Details of an ALERT system for the identification and notification of actual or potential problems relating to engineering or safety are described, as well as the communications network system established through organizations working on related problems. The utilization of computerized data banks in conjunction with a microfilm data file for information storage and retrieval is discussed. The feedback of engineering and safety defect information to the manufacturer for corrective action and product improvement is explained. The cooperation with industry associations, such as the Electronic Industries Association (EIA), representing the manufacturers is also emphasized. Examples and case histories of data utilization and the monetary and reliability benefits gained by government and industry participants are provided. The mandatory contractual participation requirements as well as the voluntary participation by industry are discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "July 1986", "date": "July 1986", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "7", "pages": "13 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Edwin T.
