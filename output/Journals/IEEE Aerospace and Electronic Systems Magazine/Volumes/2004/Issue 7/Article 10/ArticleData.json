Historically, the US Air Force has desired to achieve an autonomous capability to maintain the equipment it uses. This has been achieved, traditionally, by setting-up three levels of maintenance: organizational; intermediate (back-shop); and depot. The I-level back-shops often utilize militarized automatic test equipment (ATE) and test program sets (TPSs) to test today's complex aircraft line replaceable units (LRUs). And even though this is still a cost-effective maintenance philosophy, it has become costly to develop militarized ATE. The Department of Defense (DoD) has been very active in trying to reduce the total ownership cost of ATE in the government inventory. One approach is to utilize commercial, instead of Mil-Spec, ATE. However, utilizing commercial ATE at an USAF back-shop is not without its tradeoffs and challenges as it represents a significant deviation from the way the USAF maintenance squadrons are accustomed to \"doing business.\" This paper documents the current success story of replacing the legacy C-17 I-level ATE with a commercial ATE.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "36", "date_publication": "July 2004", "inspec": "8146094", "date": "July 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 25 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "7", "pages": "31 - 36", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["F.
