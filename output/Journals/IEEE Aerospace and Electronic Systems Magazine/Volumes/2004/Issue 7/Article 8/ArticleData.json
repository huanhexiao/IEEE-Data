This paper presents a number of assumptions regarding anticipated procedures and the use of a synthetic vision system, and addresses the desirability of integrating temporary constraints related to the airspace, the airport, and standard procedures. Following this, a number of examples are presented that illustrate a potential approach to integrate such information into a synthetic vision display. The paper ends with an overview of the results from an experiment in which the influence of an integration of temporary constraint information on pilot decision-making was examined.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "July 2004", "inspec": "8146092", "date": "July 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 25 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "7", "pages": "19 - 23", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["E.
