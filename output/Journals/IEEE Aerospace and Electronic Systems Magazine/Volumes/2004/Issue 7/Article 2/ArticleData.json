Over time, the instrumentation used in the depot will need to be repaired or replaced and, oftentimes, the older instruments are no longer serviceable or manufactured. This paper discusses how to replace the obsolete instrument and its associated hardware. Test module adapter with a software module and driver that allows compatibility between the original test executive and the modern instrument without re-hosting existing test program sets. Systems & Electronics, Inc. has implemented this procedure for a digitizer and precision DC power supply on a depot that utilizes the IEEE-488 general purpose interface bus (GPIB) for communication between the control computer and instrumentation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "July 2004", "inspec": "8146093", "date": "July 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 25 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "7", "pages": "25 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
