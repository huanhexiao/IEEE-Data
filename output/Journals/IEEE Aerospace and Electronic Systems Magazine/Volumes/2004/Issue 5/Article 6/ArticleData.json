A commercial standard (ARINC-664) and an aircraft vendor-specific implementation known as avionics full duplex switched Ethernet (AFDX) have been developed that defines the topology and use of switched Ethernet in an avionics application. In avionics applications, the movement of data between devices must take place in a deterministic fashion and must be delivered reliably. All aircraft flight hardware must be tested to be sure that it will communicate information properly in the switched Ethernet network. The airframe manufacture must test the integrated network to verify that all flight hardware is communicating properly. Testing and maintenance testing is required to perform data communication level testing of switched Ethernet architectures for avionics applications to insure that all communication is deterministic and reliable. This paper provides an overview of a switched Ethernet avionics network and identifies the testing challenges associated with a switched Ethernet avionics application. A practical implementation performing the required tests is discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "35", "date_publication": "May 2004", "inspec": "8034652", "date": "May 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 01 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "5", "pages": "31 - 35", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["K.
