The profile statistics, represented by the characteristic parameters such as position mean and variance in the x-and y-directions, of a frame in a video sequence can easily be calculated and sent as side information to the receiver. At the receiving end, temporal attacks such as transposition, dropping, and insertion can be detected by comparing side information and characteristic parameters calculated from the received video. The simulation results show that the proposed method can successfully re-synchronize the attacked video back to the original format with accuracy from 72.41% to 98.15% for various video sequences based on single frame matching. After the voting process, the GOP detection accuracy can be improved to the range of from 96.30% to 100%.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "May 2004", "inspec": "8034650", "date": "May 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 01 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "5", "pages": "21 - 25", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Shih-Wei Sun", "Pao-Chi Chang"], "keywords": ["image sequences", "statistics", "synchronisation", "video coding", "watermarking", "dropping", "insertion", "position mean", "position variance", "profile statistics matching", "side information", "single frame matching", "temporal attacks", "temporal synchronization", "transposition", "video sequence", "video watermarking synchronization", "x-directions", "y-directions", "Face detection", "Feature extraction", "Robustness", "Standards development", "Statistics", "Sun", "Video compression", "Video sequences", "Voting", "Watermarking", ""], "arnumber": "1301222"}
