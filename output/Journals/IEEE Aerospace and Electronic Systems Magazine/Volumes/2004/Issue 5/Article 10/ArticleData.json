The 90 MDS aircraft make up a total of 5778 airframes, each with a different number of Line Replaceable Units (LRUs) which make up the avionics systems. Some of the MDSs have as few as 53 avionics LRUs while others as many as 495. The total dollar value of the USAF aircraft avionics LRUs is approximately $42.4B and $30.68B in spares. Depot repairable cost to maintain these components each year is approximately $1.2B. Each MDS is assigned specific missions and the avionics systems are developed to support those missions. Due to the evolution of mission types and user needs, change is constant for the avionics manager.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "15", "date_publication": "May 2004", "inspec": "8034648", "date": "May 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 01 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "5", "pages": "9 - 15", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["B.
