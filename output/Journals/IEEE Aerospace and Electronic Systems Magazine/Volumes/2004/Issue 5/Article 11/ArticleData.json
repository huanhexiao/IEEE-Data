Depending on the regional characteristics and type of conflicting forces, air defense threats vary considerably. In regional conflicts, where forces with similar capabilities are involved and no air-superiority can be achieved, the role of air defense systems becomes critical. In combat terrains containing mountains (in mainland or in small islands), the man-operated or computer-controlled (using passive sensors) anti-aircraft artillery can be highly effective. The simulator presented in this work aims to exploit the capabilities provided by current commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) communication and multimedia technologies for providing a training environment that improves the personnel capability for effective use of man-controlled anti-aircraft weapons.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "26", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "May 2004", "inspec": "8034651", "date": "May 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 01 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "5", "pages": "26 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
