(MSSI) was tasked with the development of a general-purpose, ultrawideband hardware simulator capable of reproducing a wide variety of ultrawideband (UWB) waveforms. The simulator, with UWB outputs from baseband through millimeter wave, was to be used for the purpose of electromagnetic susceptibility testing of legacy military radio, radar, and positioning systems. The ultimate goal of this portion of the Phase I program was the quantitative determination of those UWB parameters (e.g., frequency, power, pulse rate, pulse shape, dithering, etc.) which had the least impact on the operational performance of legacy designs. This describes the development of the MSSI NETEX UWB simulator (BFP1000).", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "36", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "41", "date_publication": "May 2004", "inspec": "8034653", "date": "May 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 01 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "5", "pages": "36 - 41", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
