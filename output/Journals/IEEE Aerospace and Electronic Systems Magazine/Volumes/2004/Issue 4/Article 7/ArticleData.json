Studies conducted by EUROCONTROL in 2001-2003 indicate significant levels of inconsistency between flight data available to aircraft operators, air traffic control (ATC), air traffic flow management (ATFM), airports and military systems, causing unnecessary workload, inefficient use of resources, and unnecessary delays. Eurocontrol's new flight data interoperability concept is intended to resolve this problem. Having passed through the initial feasibility phase, this concept is now entering the development phase, in which it will become the basis for the development of a draft interoperability standard to be used in Europe for the specifications of new flight data processing systems deployed from 2007 onwards, and potentially to be proposed to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) for global standardisation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "April 2004", "inspec": "8026652", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 01 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "4", "pages": "11 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
