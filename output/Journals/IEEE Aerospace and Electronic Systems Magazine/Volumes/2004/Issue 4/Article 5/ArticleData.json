The average location difference was 3 meters and two periodic error components were found. Their tune constants were 1.8 and 28 seconds and the peak amplitudes 1.5 and 1.1 meters, respectively. In addition to these, a clear dependency of location error standard deviation figures on the GPS antenna mounting distance from the sea level was observed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "36", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "39", "date_publication": "April 2004", "inspec": "8026657", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 01 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "4", "pages": "36 - 39", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
