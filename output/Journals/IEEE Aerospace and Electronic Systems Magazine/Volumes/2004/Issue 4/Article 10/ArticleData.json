The momentum wheel for micro satellites has a mass of 1.1 kg with an angular momentum capacity of 3.5 J sec. It occupies a volume of 12.7 cm in diameter and 5 cm in height. It operates within the restricted power budget of a microsatellite with a total power supply of only 10 watts. It consumes less than 1 watt for sustenance. The micro high-temperature superconductor flywheel for nano/pico satellites has an angular momentum capacity of 0.083 Js and stores 2.32 kJ at 530 krpm. Its energy storage capacity is approximately 45 Wh/kg with an energy density of around 370 kJ/L. The HTS systems can perform the dual function of a power/attitude control system and are ideally suited for low Earth orbit energy storage, power generation, and attitude control of spacecraft.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "32", "date_publication": "April 2004", "inspec": "8026655", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 01 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "4", "pages": "27 - 32", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Eunjeong Lee"], "keywords": ["aerospace instrumentation", "artificial satellites", "attitude control", "high-temperature superconductors", "superconducting devices", "10 W", "Earth orbit energy storage", "HTS systems", "HTS-magnet momentum wheel", "angular momentum capacity", "attitude-energy systems", "energy density", "energy storage capacity", "high-temperature superconductor", "micro HTS flywheel", "microsatellite", "nanopico satellites", "power control system", "power generation", "spacecraft control", "superconductor attitude control system", "superconductor energy storage", "Control systems", "Energy storage", "Flywheels", "Friction", "High temperature superconductors", "Low earth orbit satellites", "Power supplies", "Space vehicles", "Superconducting magnets", "Wheels", ""], "arnumber": "1301771"}
