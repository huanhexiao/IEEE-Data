The project was part of the requirements for a class in AI at NOVA Southeastern University and a beginning project at NASA Wallops Flight Facility for a resilient, robust, and intelligent UAV flight control system. A method is outlined which allows a base level application for applying an artificial intelligence method, fuzzy logic, to aspects of control logic for UAV flight. One element of UAV flight, automated altitude hold, has been implemented and preliminary results displayed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "8", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "Aug. 2004", "inspec": "8146097", "date": "Aug. 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 25 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "8", "pages": "8 - 12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["W.
