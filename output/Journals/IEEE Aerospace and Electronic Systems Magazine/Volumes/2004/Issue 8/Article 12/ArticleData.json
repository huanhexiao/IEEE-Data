Brief descriptions of two NIST-developed measurement systems are provided. High-fidelity time-domain waveforms are shown, along with associated amplitude spectra for several devices. Results are shown for both conducted and radiated emissions from UWB devices.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "Aug. 2004", "inspec": "8146098", "date": "Aug. 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 25 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "8", "pages": "18 - 22", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
