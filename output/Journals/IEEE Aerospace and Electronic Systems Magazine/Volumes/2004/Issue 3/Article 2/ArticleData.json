Electronic Systems Command (ESC) at Hanscom AFB, Massachusetts, has written a draft handbook on the use of Spiral Development for all future Command and Control (C2) systems, including reference to the DoD 5000 series and Air Force Program Directive 63-1, Acquisition System, which deploys this OSD mandate for future C2 systems. Barry Boehm's continued work on SDM which he conceived in the 1980s, is heavily biased toward development of new systems that are software-intensive, as noted in a workshop he gave at the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) in 2000.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "9", "date_publication": "March 2004", "inspec": "7942158", "date": "March 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Mar 22 00:00:00 EST 2004", "issue": "3", "pages": "3 - 9", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
