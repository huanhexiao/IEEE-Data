A successful roadmap will provide for Operation & Support (O&S;) cost reduction, preserve Test Program Set (TPS) development investments, and evolve in concert with the DoD Executive Agent for Automatic Test Systems (ATS) initiatives and commercial industry, and (e.g., NxTest) changes. The near-term objective of this phase of the USAF Shared Technologies Program is to demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating available commercial technology into the Radio Frequency (RF) Mobile Electronic Test Set (RFMETS). The RFMETS was originally delivered to the USAF during the early 1990s and is used to support a variety of C-130 avionics including the APQ-170 and APQ-180 Radar Systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "20", "date_publication": "March 2004", "inspec": "7942160", "date": "March 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Mar 22 00:00:00 EST 2004", "issue": "3", "pages": "15 - 20", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
