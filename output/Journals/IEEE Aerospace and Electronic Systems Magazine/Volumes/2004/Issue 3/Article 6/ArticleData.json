Its key technology is how to identify stellar maps. Triangle algorithm is used most widely in the current star map identification algorithms. In the field of physical geography modelling, Delaunay triangulation cutting algorithm has been widely used because of its important characteristic; the result of this triangulation cutting method is unique from a random set of points. This triangulation algorithm is first applied to identify star map for its particular character. In final, the proposed method is applied to simulation; the results show that compared with the current star map identification algorithms, the algorithm presented in this paper has the advantage of real-time properties and robustness. It needs a smaller database of guidance stars and matches more rapidly.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "10", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "14", "date_publication": "March 2004", "inspec": "7942159", "date": "March 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Mar 22 00:00:00 EST 2004", "issue": "3", "pages": "10 - 14", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Wang Ziliang", "Quan Wei"], "keywords": ["attitude measurement", "identification", "mesh generation", "navigation", "sensors", "space vehicles", "Delaunay triangulation cutting algorithm", "all-sky autonomous identification algorithm", "celestial navigation", "guidance stars", "physical geography modelling", "real-time properties", "robustness", "spacecraft", "star map identification algorithm", "star sensors", "stellar maps", "triangle algorithm", "Databases", "Extraterrestrial measurements", "Geography", "Geology", "Intelligent sensors", "Navigation", "Robustness", "Sensor phenomena and characterization", "Space technology", "Space vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "1275309"}
