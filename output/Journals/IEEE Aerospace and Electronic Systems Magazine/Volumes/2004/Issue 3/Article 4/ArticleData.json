Although rare, it has catastrophic effects. In the aftermath of 9-11, it is the responsibility of security personnel to help every employee get back to business as normal, while being prepared for possible future terrorist attacks. An up-to-date contingency plan is expected to help security managers fulfill this role. Security managers should reassess or develop this contingency plan using FEMA's guidebook. They are encouraged to adopt the Homeland Security Advisory System, or to develop alternative, simple colour-coded systems to respond to the threat of terrorist attack. They are also encouraged to consider three factors in planning: top management's commitment; adequate training; and coordination with public agencies.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "March 2004", "inspec": "7932370", "date": "March 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Mar 22 00:00:00 EST 2004", "issue": "3", "pages": "21 - 25", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Hsiao-Ming Wang"], "keywords": ["emergency services", "planning", "terrorism", "Homeland Security Advisory System", "adequate training", "contingency planning", "emergency preparedness", "public agencies coordination", "security personnel", "terrorist attacks", "top management commitment", "Business", "Contingency management", "Data security", "Disaster management", "Government", "Humans", "Management training", "National security", "Personnel", "Terrorism", ""], "arnumber": "1275311"}
