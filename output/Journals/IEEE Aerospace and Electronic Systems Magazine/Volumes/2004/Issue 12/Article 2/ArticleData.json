Both operate in the high frequency (HF) band between 3 and 30 MegaHertz (MHz), which are wavelengths between 100 and 10 metres, respectively. Based on current evidence, it appears that Australia may have found the tools with which to conduct efficient long-range surface and air surveillance more effectively than by the single use of traditional surveillance forces. Given increasing success and refinement of these technologies, one can see that the SWR systems in particular could, in addition, satisfy a number of potential export requirements and earn useful export credits.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "8", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "Dec. 2004", "inspec": "8224826", "date": "Dec. 2004", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 26 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "12", "pages": "8 - 10", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
