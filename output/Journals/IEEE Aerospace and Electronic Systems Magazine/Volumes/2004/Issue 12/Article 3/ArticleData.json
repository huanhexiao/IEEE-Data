New and novel results showing the Doppler contributions due to dynamic rough and smooth surface scattering effects are discussed and analysed. In the latter case, significant sideband conversion occurs together with a rapid fall off in the power density spectrum. Future work is proposed and discussed. A fuller analysis of these preliminary results and further results was presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "14", "date_publication": "Dec. 2004", "inspec": "8224827", "date": "Dec. 2004", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 26 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "12", "pages": "11 - 14", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
