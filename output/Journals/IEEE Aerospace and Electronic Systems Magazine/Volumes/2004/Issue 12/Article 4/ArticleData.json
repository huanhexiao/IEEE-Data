Besides the well-established airborne threats, new platforms for air surveillance and attacking devices have appeared and recognized air picture (RAP) production needs to be revised and modified following the events of September 11, 2001. From a military operational and logistic support point of view, it is well-known that not only the long range radars currently in operation, but also the recently procured radars, degrade in performance rapidly and their maintenance costs are high. Using the possibilities offered by emerging technical developments, the problem is to upgrade sensors and existing infrastructure in a way that exploits the information gathered optimally. It is the opinion of this author that one of the most promising approaches to emphasis net-centricity is the use of radar-triangle netcentric structures augmented by netted VHF radars to solve these tasks in a cost-effective manner. This work introduces an analysis of a solution that fully integrates newly required capabilities into the current long range radar net and infrastructure, keeping research and development (R&D;) and maintenance at a low cost.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "Dec. 2004", "inspec": "8224828", "date": "Dec. 2004", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 26 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "12", "pages": "15 - 29", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["I.
