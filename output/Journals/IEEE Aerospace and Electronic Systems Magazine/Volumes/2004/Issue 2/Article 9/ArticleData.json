These outdoor perimeter fence detection sensors must reliably detect intruders attempting to cut or climb the barrier, while ignoring the effects of environmental noise, including nearby activity. In recent conference proceedings, the new IntelliFIBER\u2122 fiber optic based product was introduced and compared with previous technologies. IntelliFIBER is designed to provide the advantages of a nonconductive \"dielectric\" cable sensor, e.g., resistance to electromagnetic interference and the ability to provide longer cable zones. It utilizes the proven processor of the Intelli-FLEX\u2122 triboelectric cable fence sensor, which provides relay or bidirectional networked serial communications and is compatible with its calibration module. IntelliFIBER also capitalizes on the Intelli-FLEX's adaptive detection algorithms that were developed through extensive field-testing, to provide exceptional immunity to environmental alarms while still detecting the skilled intruder.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "8", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "13", "date_publication": "Feb. 2004", "inspec": "7981298", "date": "Feb. 2004", "date_current_version": "Wed Mar 03 00:00:00 EST 2004", "issue": "2", "pages": "8 - 13", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
