Ground-based or maritime use is assumed. The cases discussed include volume clutter due to rain or other particles within the antenna's main beam and surface clutter due to grass, soil, or snow. Depending on the available RF hardware and desired lowest detectable target RCS, pulses as short as 20 ns look feasible. Modern signal processing methods enable the detection of targets close to the noise limit. It seems, therefore, appropriate to discuss the relevance of using 3 dB beamwidths for clutter cell calculations. Experiments suggest that more accurate predictions are obtained by using 1 dB widths instead. The lack of comprehensive data for very small grazing angles and the less surveyed small-scale topography of radar environments set some constraints for straightforward implementations. Preliminary results indicate averaged surface clutter RCS levels less than -12 dBsm at V-band for small grazing angles.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "17", "date_publication": "Jan 2004", "inspec": "8018132", "date": "Jan 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 16 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "1", "pages": "14 - 17", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
