Radar systems operating in the higher microwave or millimeter wave bands seem to be an attractive choice in terms of tracking capabilities and operation in poor visibility. Efficient mechatronic arrangements are needed for the stabilization of the pedestal at least down to 0.1\u00b0 level if full specifications must be met also during platform motion or weapon launches. No ultimate parameters have been observed, until now, that would totally preclude the usage of such a short-range radar also at zero antenna elevation in typical sub-arctic scenery. The fluent throughput of the entire fleet upgrading task and future maintainability must be evaluated parallel to the acute technological challenges and user requirements.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "26", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "32", "date_publication": "Jan 2004", "inspec": "8018134", "date": "Jan 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 16 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "1", "pages": "26 - 32", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["H.
