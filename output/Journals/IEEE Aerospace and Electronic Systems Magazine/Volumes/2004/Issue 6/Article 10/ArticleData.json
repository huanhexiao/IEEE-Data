At the time of this writing, numerous detection equipment models, three specific airports, and a placement and passenger flow simulation tool for airport security planners have been developed. Similar tools have been constructed for simulating cargo/baggage inspection and other airport security operations. An extension of the original effort to consolidate the tools is currently underway.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "June 2004", "inspec": "8018142", "date": "June 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 28 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "6", "pages": "23 - 28", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
