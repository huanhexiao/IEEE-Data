The system is intended for ground mobile use and provides more than 1 km of coverage also in moderately obstructed terrain indicating allowable maximum path loss up to 110 dB. The mobile transmitter end uses a sturdy flexible antenna. Typical sensor signals include voltage outputs from accelerometers, strain gauges, and thermistors, but live broadcasting-quality television is also easy to implement. Digital interfacing is accomplished through suitable D/A converters, multiplexers, and coders. Both the transmitter and receiver utilize commercial-off-the-shelf building blocks in order to keep the total cost within acceptable limits.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "31", "date_publication": "Oct. 2004", "inspec": "8164144", "date": "Oct. 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Dec 13 00:00:00 EST 2004", "issue": "10", "pages": "27 - 31", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
