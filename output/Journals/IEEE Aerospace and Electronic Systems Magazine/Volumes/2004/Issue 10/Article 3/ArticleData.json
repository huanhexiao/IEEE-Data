Advances in solid-state MEMS rate sensors, coupled with Kalman filter algorithms designed to mitigate high drift rates, provide the basis for low-cost, high-performance AHRS for general aviation. This paper describes the performance of a low cost, miniaturized AHRS using automotive-grade MEMS sensors. The performance of the system is detailed. The implications for certification of this class of system and fault tolerance are discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Oct. 2004", "inspec": "8164141", "date": "Oct. 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Dec 13 00:00:00 EST 2004", "issue": "10", "pages": "13 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["L.
