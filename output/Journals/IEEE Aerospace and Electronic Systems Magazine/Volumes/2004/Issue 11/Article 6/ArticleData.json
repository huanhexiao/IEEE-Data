Of these, mnemonics are very popular; whilst of designation systems used by the US armed forces is probably best known, whilst the Russian system is least understood. Other well-known identification systems and schemes are those employed in Sweden, France, and the UK and are amplified in this article.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "36", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "39", "date_publication": "Nov. 2004", "inspec": "8208175", "date": "Nov. 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Dec 13 00:00:00 EST 2004", "issue": "11", "pages": "36 - 39", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
