A recent update of this system consisted of the replacement of an obsolete and very costly to maintain inertial navigation system. Another reason for updating the ship's inertial system was to provide higher accuracy attitude data, than was previously available with the old inertial system, to the high resolution multi-beam sonar system in order to produce improved bathymetric charts. After conducting a market survey of suitable inertial navigator systems, the Kearfott SEANAV ring laser gyro navigator (RLGN) system, using a monolithic T-24 gyro, was selected to replace the old inertial system. The selection of the SEANAV RLGN was based on its relatively low cost, high reliability, and, particularly, the roll and pitch data accuracies of typically less than 1-arc-minute. This attitude data accuracy was key to enable a significant improvement in the bathymetry data accuracy. Two SEANAV systems were integrated with GPS receivers, a system master time code generator, and electro magnetic (EM) log and Doppler sonar speed sensors to provide the navigation portion of the mapping data. Operational testing of this updated system aboard HMS SCOTT, in November, 2003, showed a marked improvement in the quality of the map product due, in part, to the improved attitude data provided by the SEANAV RLGN system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "Nov. 2004", "inspec": "8208172", "date": "Nov. 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Dec 13 00:00:00 EST 2004", "issue": "11", "pages": "18 - 23", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
