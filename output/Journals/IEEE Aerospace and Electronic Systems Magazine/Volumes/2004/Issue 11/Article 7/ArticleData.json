An inexpensive disk array system based on EIDE hard disk drives is proposed, which has not only much higher speed than a tape library but also much lower price than a general SCSI or fibre channel disk array. Each string controller in a disk array can support up to 16 hard disk drives (4TB) and multiple RAID levels (RAID 0,1,0+1,3, 5, NRAID or JBOD). It also provides multiform interfaces for the host computer, including SCSI, USB, FireWire, EIDE, Serial ATA, etc. Since this kind of disk array has excellent price performance ratio, it is worth using in a mass data backup area instead of tape equipments and other low-end secondary storage applications.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "24", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "Nov. 2004", "inspec": "8208173", "date": "Nov. 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Dec 13 00:00:00 EST 2004", "issue": "11", "pages": "24 - 29", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Kun Gao", "Jing Pei", "Haizheng Xu", "Longfa Pan"], "keywords": ["RAID", "back-up procedures", "computer interfaces", "disc drives", "hard discs", "EIDE disk array system", "EIDE hard disk drives", "FireWire", "RAID", "SCSI", "Serial ATA", "USB", "enhanced integrated drive electronics drives", "fibre channel disk array", "mass data backup", "redundant arrays of independent disks", "secondary storage", "string controller", "tape equipments", "tape library", "Application software", "Computer interfaces", "Costs", "Firewire", "Hard disks", "Libraries", "Memory", "Optical fiber devices", "Scalability", "Universal Serial Bus", ""], "arnumber": "1365662"}
