In order to perform accurate observation of vessel traffic without such efforts, the authors have developed a completely automated radar network system covering the main traffic route of Tokyo Bay. In August 2003, as the second remote radar station attaching AIS equipment was set at East Ogishima (the first was installed at the National Defense Academy in 2002), the observing range could be enlarged and cover most traffic routes in Tokyo Bay. These two radars can observe the vessel traffic in Tokyo Bay simultaneously so as to know the traffic flow accurately on the basis of analyzing the integrated radar data. In addition to the development of a radar network system, the software to analyze observed vessel traffic flow has been developed. This software has various functions such as tracking of ship's position, automatic determination of ship's size, animation of ship's movements, superposition of successive radar images, display of ship's tracks, calculation of ship's speed distribution, extraction of dangerous ship encounters using subjective judgment value and bumper model, etc. Some analyzed results on vessel traffic flow observed by the remote radars in January and September 2003 are shown in this paper.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "11", "date_publication": "Nov. 2004", "inspec": "8208170", "date": "Nov. 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Dec 13 00:00:00 EST 2004", "issue": "11", "pages": "3 - 11", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Shun Liu", "H.
