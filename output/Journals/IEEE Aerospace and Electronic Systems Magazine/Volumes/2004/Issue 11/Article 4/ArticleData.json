One approach is to develop an electronic countermeasure system against the gunner's command and communication (C2) capabilities, specifically the usage of modern wireless phones. Such a countermeasure system conducts a quick detection and geo-location of the targeted (hostile) mobile wireless subscriber, allows the airborne platform to make appropriate decisions: 1) to divert and avoid potential military conflicts; 2) to cue artillery supports and prepare for attack; or 3) to relay the coordinates of the potential threat to his own command and control units. In this paper, we discuss the technical approach of the countermeasure system, especially in two design areas: 1) detection and tracking of enemy C2 signals; and 2) geo-location of a targeted communication link.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "30", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "35", "date_publication": "Nov. 2004", "inspec": "8208174", "date": "Nov. 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Dec 13 00:00:00 EST 2004", "issue": "11", "pages": "30 - 35", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
