The legacy test system, while fully operational, was rapidly becoming non-supportable. Unless replaced with new hardware and upgraded test program sets, the needed long-term support could not be provided to the weapon system. To address this issue within the scope of available program funding constraints, the Air Force selected an approach of combining the technical and programmatic expertise of the weapon system prime contractor, the program control responsibilities of the weapon system Program Office, and the technical capability of an Air Force technical organization. The program was divided into two phases: a prototype phase and a production/rehost phase. This paper gives an overview of the program and presents valuable lessons learned during the prototype phase.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "24", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "Sept. 2004", "inspec": "8164137", "date": "Sept. 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 25 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "9", "pages": "24 - 28", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["K.
