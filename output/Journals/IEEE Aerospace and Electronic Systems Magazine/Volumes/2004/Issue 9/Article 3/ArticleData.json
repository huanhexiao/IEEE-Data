This includes integrating UUT data, test set-up, test execution, test results, repair and replace actions with other systems to provide a \"closed-loop\" system. One example of the \"closed-loop\" system is a non-intrusive tool referred to as Smart TPS (Test Program Set). Smart TPS will provide informational services to the user that reduce diagnostic test times and provide an ordered list of replacement actions based on historical data. Where possible, data are exchanged via the automatic test markup language (ATML).", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "7", "date_publication": "Sept. 2004", "inspec": "8164133", "date": "Sept. 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 25 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "9", "pages": "3 - 7", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["S.
