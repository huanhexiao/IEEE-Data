There are several to choose from and each has benefits. A comparison of topologies is made based on the benefits and drawbacks for various usage situations. Some of the topologies of interest are: placing the instrumentation and the controller on the corporate intranet; using switching hubs for traffic isolation; using a second LAN connection in the test system controller as a private network for instrumentation; placing a router between the intranet and the test system controller; and widely distributing test assets. Test asset visibility to the rest of the network has both security and test integrity implications. Trading off the benefits of ready access and observation (which promotes collaboration) against system visibility needs to be carefully examined. Several use cases will be presented for examination: simply connected user; semi-automated test; fully automated test; and remote collaboration for system problem-solving.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "Sept. 2004", "inspec": "8164135", "date": "Sept. 2004", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 25 00:00:00 EDT 2004", "issue": "9", "pages": "14 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["L.
