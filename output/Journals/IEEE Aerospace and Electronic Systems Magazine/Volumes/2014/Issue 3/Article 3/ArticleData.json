Increasing the coherent integration time of the high-resolution DVB-T component in a track-before-detect approach, cued by the Doppler information obtained through the FM radio component, provides high-range resolution at extended detection ranges. In addition, the DAB-using component, cued by Doppler information provided by FM radio, extends the high-resolution detection volume to elevation ranges not illuminated by DVB-T. The heart of such a hybrid passive radar sensor will be the cued track-before-detect procedure, which is currently being developed at Fraunhofer Institute for High Frequency Physics and Radar Techniques in Wachtberg, Germany.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "March 2014", "inspec": "14265361", "date": "March 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Apr 25 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "3", "pages": "15 - 25", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Heiner Kuschel", "Martin Ummenhofer", "Pierfrancesco Lombardo", "Fabiola Colone", "Carlo Bongioanni"], "keywords": ["Doppler effect", "digital audio broadcasting", "digital video broadcasting", "passive radar", "radar detection", "radar resolution", "radar tracking", "ARGUS 3D", "DAB Tx", "DVB-T signal", "Doppler information", "FM radio emissions", "Fraunhofer Institute for High Frequency Physics and Radar Techniques", "Germany", "Wachtberg", "coherent integration", "elevation coverage capability", "high-resolution detection", "hybrid passive radar sensor", "radar range detection", "radar range resolution", "track-before-detect procedure", "Emissions", "Frequency modulation", "Passive radar", "Radar measurements", "Radar remote sensing", "Radio communication", "Sensors", ""], "arnumber": "6805362"}
