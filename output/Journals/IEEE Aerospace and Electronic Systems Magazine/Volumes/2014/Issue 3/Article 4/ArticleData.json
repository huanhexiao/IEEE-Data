Backed by a large database of actual weather observations and forecasts, it has the capability to simulate very realistic weather conditions, covers most of the extreme weather situations that can be encountered in real operations and validates the robustness of the studied solutions. SIMET can be interfaced with existing flight simulators using a dedicated message-oriented protocol. It can also be used to select and extract weather datasets for ingestion by engineering model simulations offline.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "26", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "31", "date_publication": "March 2014", "inspec": "14265359", "date": "March 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Apr 25 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "3", "pages": "26 - 31", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Kate Dondenaz", "Jean-Marc Gaubert", "Florent Birling", "Patrick Josse"], "keywords": ["aerospace simulation", "geographic information systems", "protocols", "weather forecasting", "SIMET", "dedicated message-oriented protocol", "engineering model simulations", "flight management functions", "flight simulators", "large database", "weather dataset extraction", "weather environment simulator", "weather forecasting", "weather observations", "Aerospace electronics", "Atmospheric measurements", "Database systems", "Enviornmental factors", "Message systems", "Meteorology", "Weather forecasting", ""], "arnumber": "6805363"}
