SiGe BiCMOS technology is one of the enablers of this move with its ability to withstand extremely wide variations in temperature and high radiation doses. This article has presented two SiGe BiCMOS wireline transceivers designed to be a part of the new system perspective by creating a means of control and communication across vehicle-wide buses. Both the RS-485 and ISO 11898 transceivers have been shown to work robustly from 90 K to 390 K, with consistent rise/fall times, propagation delays, and output amplitudes. Additionally, the ISO 11898 transceiver is TID tolerant to 2 Mrad, and the transmitter is hardened to single-event effects.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "32", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "41", "date_publication": "March 2014", "inspec": "14265360", "date": "March 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Apr 25 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "3", "pages": "32 - 41", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Troy England", "Chandim Chatterjee", "Nelson Lourenco", "Steven Finn", "Laleh Najafizadeh", "Stanley Phillips", "Eleazar Kenyon", "Ryan Diestelhorst", "John Cressler"], "keywords": ["BiCMOS integrated circuits", "Ge-Si alloys", "radiation hardening (electronics)", "transceivers", "ISO 11898 transceiver", "RS-485 transceiver", "SiGe", "TID tolerant", "cold-capable radiation-hardened BiCMOS wireline transceiver", "delay propagation", "minimally shielded sensor", "radiation dose", "shielded temperature-controlled warm box", "single-event effect", "space-based system", "temperature 90 K to 390 K", "transmitter", "vehicle-wide bus", "Aeorospace electronics", "BiCMOS integrated circuits", "Radiation monitoring", "Space research", "Space vehicles", "Temperature measurement", "Transceivers", ""], "arnumber": "6805364"}
