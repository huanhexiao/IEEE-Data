Thanks to a wide bandwidth and a large dynamic range, with four linear channels plus a logarithmic channel, this TDR allows us to record the signals of interest with minimal distortion, from sources whose distance from the antenna sys-tem ranges from a few tens of meters up to hundreds of kilometers. From the recorded signals, it is possible: 1) to characterize the traffic in the 1,090-MHz band, and 2) to test the effectiveness of different source separation algorithms, either based on space diversity or based on frequency diversity. The system permits a higher degree of automation and higher quantity of data acquisition than some previous experimental systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "6", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "13", "date_publication": "Feb. 2014", "inspec": "14196393", "date": "Feb. 2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Mar 26 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "2", "pages": "6 - 13", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Gaspare Galati", "Mauro Leonardi", "Emilio G.
