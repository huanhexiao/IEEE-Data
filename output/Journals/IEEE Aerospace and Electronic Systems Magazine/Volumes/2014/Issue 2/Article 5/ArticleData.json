Considering the investment made, it is essential to maintain these systems. The maintenance of systems that are in use is termed servicing existing systems. In this paper, an extension of LESAT for servicing existing systems is proposed: the lean effectiveness model for products and services. Collaborations with INCOSE ISSWG and three aerospace and technology enterprises (Boeing, Pratt & Whitney, and Raytheon), as well as review of the literature, are used in capturing best practices for success in servicing existing systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "38", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "40", "date_publication": "Feb. 2014", "inspec": "14196394", "date": "Feb. 2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Mar 26 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "2", "pages": "38 - 40", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Tina P.
