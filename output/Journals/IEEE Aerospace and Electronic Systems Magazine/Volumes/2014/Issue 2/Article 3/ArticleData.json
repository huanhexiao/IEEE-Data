It is well known that long propagation delays, intermittent connectivity, heavy channel noise, and asymmetric link rates in space environments all conspire to limit the effectiveness and performance of TCP over space communication channels, especially in deep-space communications [1]. The space Internet in deep-space interplanetary environments is generally named interplanetary Internet (IPN) [2]. Numerous literature surveys [2]-[7] have been done on IPN architectures and protocols.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "22", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "Feb. 2014", "inspec": "14196395", "date": "Feb. 2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Mar 26 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "2", "pages": "22 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Jianling Hu", "Ruhai Wang", "Xue Sun", "Qian Yu", "Zhihua Yang", "Qinyu Zhang"], "keywords": ["Internet", "delays", "space communication links", "transport protocols", "wireless channels", "DTN protocol", "IPN", "Internet-type protocol", "NASA", "National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "TCP", "asymmetric link rate", "deep space communication", "deep space interplanetary environments", "heavy channel noise", "intermittent connectivity", "interplanetary Internet", "memory dynamics", "propagation delay", "space Internet", "space agency", "space communication channel", "space environment", "terrestrial Internet", "Aerospace electronics", "IP networks", "Internet", "Internetworking", "Interplanetary", "Mars", "Memory", "NASA", "Relays", "Space vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "6778537"}
