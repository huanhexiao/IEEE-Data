The program consists of many stages: system prototyping with LabVIEW control, control algorithm implementation with a microcontroller, high-power rectifier development, and all system testing. In this article, a first prototype for the d.c. motor control system was detailed, which mainly consists of a three-phase rectifier and a PI control algorithm implemented in LabVIEW. The control loop is closed, using a rotation motor speed transducer. The motor speed, current waveform through the motor, and the voltages from each phase are acquired using a NI-USB 6251 data acquisition card. The command voltage for the three-phase rectifier is also obtained from one of the data acquisition card analog output. The power source used in this prototype was a three-phase rotating converter. The electronic scheme of the rectifier was designed using Multisim.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "21", "date_publication": "Feb. 2014", "inspec": "14196396", "date": "Feb. 2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Mar 26 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "2", "pages": "14 - 21", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Liviu Dinca", "Jenica Ileana Corcau"], "keywords": ["DC motors", "PI control", "control engineering computing", "data acquisition", "machine control", "rectifiers", "transducers", "velocity control", "virtual instrumentation", "wind tunnels", "D.C. motor control system", "LabVIEW control", "Multisim", "NI-USB 6251 data acquisition card", "PI control algorithm", "airflow speed control", "command voltage", "control loop", "current waveform", "data acquisition card analog output", "electronic scheme", "high-power rectifier development", "microcontroller", "rotation motor speed transducer", "subsonic wind tunnel", "system prototyping", "system testing", "three-phase rectifier", "three-phase rotating converter", "Brushless motors", "Control systems", "Data acquisition", "Logic gates", "Thyristors", "Transducers", "Wind speed", ""], "arnumber": "6778535"}
