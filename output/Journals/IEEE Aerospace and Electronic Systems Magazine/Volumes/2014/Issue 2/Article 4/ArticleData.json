This also includes the development of the future communication infrastructure (FCI) [3], which is jointly carried out by EUROCONTROL and the Federal Aviation Administration. Within the FCI, the L-band has been allocated for air-to-ground communications. Currently, two candidate systems for superseding the analogue voice communication system in the VHF band are taken into consideration. The frst candidate L-band digital aeronautical communications system type 1 (LDACS1) is a broadband system employing orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and frequency-division duplex (FDD). LDACS1 has been designed as a combination of P34 (TIA 902 standard) and the broadband aeronautical multicarrier communications system [4]. The second candidate LDACS2 is a narrowband single-carrier system using time-division duplex as duplex scheme. This system is a derivative of the L-band digital link and the all-purpose multichannel aviation communication system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "37", "date_publication": "Feb. 2014", "inspec": "14196397", "date": "Feb. 2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Mar 26 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "2", "pages": "31 - 37", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Ulrich Epple", "Michael Schnell"], "keywords": ["OFDM modulation", "air traffic", "aircraft communication", "EUROCONTROL", "Europe", "FCI", "FDD", "Federal Aviation Administration", "L-band digital aeronautical communications system type 1", "L-band digital link", "LDACS1", "LDACS2", "OFDM", "P34", "SESAR", "United States", "VHF band", "aeronautical communication system", "air traffic management", "air-to-ground communications", "all-purpose multichannel aviation communication system", "analogue voice communication system", "broadband aeronautical multicarrier communication system", "frequency-division duplex", "future communication infrastructure", "legacy systems", "narrowband single-carrier system", "orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing", "time-division duplex", "Aircraft", "FAA", "Frequency division multiplexing", "Interference", "L-band", "OFDM", "Receivers", "Traffic control", ""], "arnumber": "6778538"}
