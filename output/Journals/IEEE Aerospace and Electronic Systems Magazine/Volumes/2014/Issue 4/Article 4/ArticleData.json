Critical issues in positioning with SOOP were discussed, which include the lack of independent SOOP (poor GDOP), SOOP clock errors, 2-D vs. 3-D solutions, multipath and NLOS signals, and signal integrity, among others. We described the development of mobile test-beds with hardware and software features and presented field test results. The signals of opportunity that we have successfully acquired and tracked with our test-beds and then used to derive navigation solutions include GPS, DTV, GSM, and IS95/CDMA2000 (1xRTT) signals. Based on the comparative assessments and test results, this article advocates the use of mixed (hybrid/fused) signals of opportunity, which has the potential to alleviate several technical difficulties faced by positioning with SOOP. Our ongoing effort is to expand our software radios to include other communication and broadcast signals and modulation schemes and to perform cooperative position localization.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "34", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "46", "date_publication": "April 2014", "inspec": "14318921", "date": "April 2014", "date_current_version": "Tue May 20 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "4", "pages": "34 - 46", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Chun Yang", "Thao Nguyen", "Erik Blasch"], "keywords": ["3G mobile communication", "Global Positioning System", "cellular radio", "digital television", "mobility management (mobile radio)", "sensor fusion", "1xRTT signals", "DTV signals", "GPS", "GSM", "Global Positioning System", "IS95/CDMA2000", "NLOS signals", "SOOP", "cooperative position localization", "digital television", "hardware features", "mixed signals of opportunity", "mobile positioning", "mobile test-beds", "multipath signals", "nonline-of-sight", "software features", "Aircraft navigation", "Attenuation", "Global Positioning System", "Interference", "Jamming", "Mobile radio mobility management", "Navigation", "Position measurement", ""], "arnumber": "6819122"}
