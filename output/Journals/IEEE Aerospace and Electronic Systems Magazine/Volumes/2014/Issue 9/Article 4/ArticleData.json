It is a land inhabited by rattlesnakes, tarantulas, giant scorpions, and poisonous hunting spiders (called vinegaroons by the locals) because their bite leaves the taste of vinegar in your mouth. The plants are mostly sagebrush, cactus, and Joshua trees. The temperature can rise above 100 deg F during daytime and drop below freezing at night. In the middle of this desert, 50 km northwest of Barstow, is Goldstone, a ghost town abandoned at the end of the gold rush era.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "34", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "41", "date_publication": "Sept. 2014", "inspec": "14703200", "date": "Sept. 2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 03 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "9", "pages": "34 - 41", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Kam Y.
