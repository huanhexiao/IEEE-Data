Its satisfaction has psychological and societal, but also technical, legal, and economic implications. Moreover, rapid progress in networking sensors producing an ever increasing diversity of information has profoundly transformed the notion of public security. This technological revolution is driven by algorithms for extracting high-value information from sensor data streams - an enabling technology rooting in the Aerospace and Electronic Systems community. Besides discussing general design principles of security assistance systems, it is a serious concern to pinpoint also societally relevant challenges that are pressing and to be solved in an interdisciplinary approach.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "Sept. 2014", "inspec": "14703199", "date": "Sept. 2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 03 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "9", "pages": "14 - 26", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Wolfgang Koch"], "keywords": ["cognition", "national security", "philosophical aspects", "systems engineering", "aerospace community", "cognitive tools", "electronic systems community", "information diversity", "networking sensors", "philosophical aspect", "public safety", "public security", "security assistance systems", "systems engineering", "Cognition", "Cultural differences", "Economics", "Law", "Psychology", "Safety", "Security", "Social factors", ""], "arnumber": "6943453"}
