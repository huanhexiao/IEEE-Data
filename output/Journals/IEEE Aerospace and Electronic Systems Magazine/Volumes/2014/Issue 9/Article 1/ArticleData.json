Recent developments in computer and sensor technology have made the control of miniature flying robots, such as minihelicopters, possible. The automatic fight of the miniature helicopters emerged with modern aviation and has evolved over time to satisfy the increasingly restrictive needs. It can be used when a task is too repetitive or too difficult. The objective of this automated fight is to control the aerial behavior of the miniature helicopters in order to manage the natural risks of the environment (measurement of air pollution) and to increase the safety areas (surveillance of the airspace, urban, and interurban traffic). A helicopter is a complex mechanical system with strongly nonlinear characteristics; therefore, understanding the fight's behavior is essential to ensuring its proper control. Nowadays, model helicopters are widely available for many academic and commercial purposes. The ability to describe and explain various phenomena involved in the interaction of helicopter dynamics has a large impact in practice. Consequently, the aim of this type of modeling is to adequately evaluate and achieve flawless control of an aerodynamic fight as soon as possible.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "Sept. 2014", "inspec": "14703198", "date": "Sept. 2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 03 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "9", "pages": "4 - 12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Mousa Boukhnifer", "Ahmed Chaibet"], "keywords": ["aerodynamics", "aircraft control", "helicopters", "motion control", "robust control", "aerial vehicle flight", "aerodynamics", "air pollution", "automated flight", "aviation", "helicopter dynamics", "helicopter fight", "miniature flying robot", "minihelicopter", "nonlinear characteristic", "robust control", "Aerodynamics", "Aircraft navigation", "Area measurement", "DC motors", "Helicopters", "Noise measurement", "Robot sensing systems", "Robust control", "Simulation", ""], "arnumber": "6943451"}
