There are many forms of SS, such as a direct sequence spread spectrum (DS/SS), frequency hopping (FH), hybrid DS-FH, and ultrawideband (UWB). In all cases, pseudorandom or pseudonoise (PN) sequences play important roles. They are periodic sequences with a long period in practical systems. The long PN sequences are desirable to reduce the probability of detection by an unintended receiver over a short time interval. But it is also a challenge for a receiver to detect and acquire the signal.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "June 2014", "inspec": "14480487", "date": "June 2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Jul 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "6", "pages": "13 - 23", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Wei Wang", "Zhihua Wang"], "keywords": ["field programmable gate arrays", "message passing", "military communication", "military equipment", "pseudonoise codes", "random codes", "random sequences", "spread spectrum communication", "FPGA", "iterative message passing algorithms", "military communication system", "pseudonoise sequence", "pseudorandom sequence", "rapid PN code acquisition implementation", "signal detection", "spread spectrum technique", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Field programmable gate arrays", "Iterative methods", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Military communication", "Random access memory", "Random sequences", "Receivers", "Signal detection", "Signal to noise ratio", "Spread spectrum communication", ""], "arnumber": "6867654"}
