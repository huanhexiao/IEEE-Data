Consequently, every kind of simulation aims to imitate certain aspects of reality. Depending on the choice of aspects to be simulated and, thus, the choice of other aspects not to be simulated, different classes of simulations exist. Usually, implementing a simulation means reducing the level of detail or the level of abstraction to make a simulation of a complex phenomenon possible. For example, when simulating a thunderstorm, it is usually not necessary to simulate the trajectory of each single molecule within reach of that storm. Instead, one would choose a level of abstraction closer to the intended outcome of the simulation. Likewise, fight simulations are usually cockpit simulations, in some cases including full motion, which entails making use of mechanical means to move the entire cockpit in a limited way. Hence, fight simulation is usually limited to the aspects of fight that can be perceived by a pilot within the cockpit. In the following, we will use the term operator for pilot, driver, or, more generally, the person inside the simulator.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "37", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "43", "date_publication": "June 2014", "inspec": "14480485", "date": "June 2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Jul 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "6", "pages": "37 - 43", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Niklas Peinecke"], "keywords": ["aerospace simulation", "electric sensing devices", "closed loop sensor simulation", "cockpit simulation", "complex phenomenon", "flight simulation", "Aerospace control", "Atmospheric modeling", "Closed loop systems", "Computational modeling", "Computer simulation", "Laser radar", "Meteorology", "Robot sensing systems", "Simulation", "Timing", ""], "arnumber": "6867656"}
