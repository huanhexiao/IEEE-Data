Here, the methodology has been applied to realistic scenarios in the Indian Ocean using real-world data evaluated by comparing extreme and trade-off solutions to assess the effectiveness of the proposed scheme for timely delivery of the solutions and achievement of mission objectives. The proposed asset planning system has a highly flexible architecture that can be expanded to account for different application-dependent risks and performance metrics. Possible directions for future studies include developing models for adaptive (adversarial) pirate behavior, as recently shown to exist and to be expected. A game theoretical approach would be suitable to model not only the optimal asset network planning but also the adaptive response of pirate activities.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "44", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "49", "date_publication": "June 2014", "inspec": "15432638", "date": "June 2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Jul 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "6", "pages": "44 - 49", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Raffaele Grasso", "Paolo Braca", "John Osler", "Jim Hansen", "Peter Willett"], "keywords": ["computer crime", "game theory", "Indian ocean", "adaptive pirate behavior", "adversarial pirate behavior", "application-dependent risks", "counter piracy operation support", "game theoretical approach", "maritime traffic situational awareness", "mission objectives", "optimal asset network planning", "performance metrics", "real-world data", "satellite AIS", "surveillance resource allocation", "Marine navigation", "Marine vehicles", "Oceanography", "Optimization", "Piracy", "Radiation detectors", "Remote sensing", "Risk management", "Satellites", "Spatial analysis", "Surveillance", ""], "arnumber": "6867657"}
