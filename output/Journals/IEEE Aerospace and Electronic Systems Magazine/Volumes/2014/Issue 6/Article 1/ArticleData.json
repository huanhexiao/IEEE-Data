A DBF system is based on an array of antenna elements acting as independent receivers that capture radio frequency (RF) signals. These signals are converted into two digital streams of baseband I and Q signals, and then they are weighted (by changing their amplitude and phase) so that when they are combined together (summed) they create a desired output (i.e., the AIS signal of interest with a high level of SINR). The article presents an antenna array with a single-element radiation pattern optimized to mitigate interference. Based on this antenna array, static and adaptive DBF techniques have been compared in terms of SINR increase and system complexity (i.e., need for a large antenna, computational complexity of an adaptive DBF technique, etc.).", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "June 2014", "inspec": "14480486", "date": "June 2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Jul 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "6", "pages": "4 - 12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Fabio Maggio", "Tommaso Rossi", "Ernestina Cianca", "Marina Ruggieri"], "keywords": ["antenna radiation patterns", "array signal processing", "interference suppression", "radio receivers", "satellite antennas", "DBF onboard AIS satellites", "RF signals", "SINR", "adaptive DBF techniques", "antenna array", "baseband I signals", "baseband Q signals", "decoded AIS messages", "digital beamforming techniques", "digital streams", "independent receivers", "interference mitigatione", "radio frequency signals", "satellite-based AIS receiver", "signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio", "single-element radiation pattern", "static DBF techniques", "Array signal processing", "Digital systems", "Identigy management systems", "Interference", "Marine vehicles", "Receivers", "Safety", "Satellites", "Signal to noise ratio", "Transponders", ""], "arnumber": "6867653"}
