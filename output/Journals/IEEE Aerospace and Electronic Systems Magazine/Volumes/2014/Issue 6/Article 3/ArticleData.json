In particular, in the field of two-fighter formation flying, perfect behavior control not only can produce more graceful formation but also can benefit the strategic offensive and strategic defensive. In this article, we present a joint control approach, an online programming control and data control method that can provide better performance of behavior control than the conventional methods. The programming method controls the controlled plant by designing a group of control laws, and the data method controls the controlled plant by dynamically reading and executing the data files. We use formation flying of a lead plane and a wing plane as an example to investigate the joint control approach.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "24", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "36", "date_publication": "June 2014", "inspec": "14480484", "date": "June 2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Jul 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "6", "pages": "24 - 36", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Yunfei Yin", "Xiaonan Wang", "Haichao Guan", "Yafei Zeng", "Beilei Zhang"], "keywords": ["aerospace computing", "aerospace simulation", "aircraft control", "control engineering computing", "control system synthesis", "military aircraft", "military computing", "position control", "behavior control", "control laws design", "controlled plant", "data control method", "data files", "lead plane", "online joint control approach", "online programming control", "strategic defensive", "strategic offensive", "two-fighter formation flying simulation", "wing plane", "Aerospace control", "Behavioral science", "Computer applications", "Computer simulation", "Cost function", "Data models", "Hidden Markov models", "Motion control", "Simulation", "Trajectory", ""], "arnumber": "6867655"}
