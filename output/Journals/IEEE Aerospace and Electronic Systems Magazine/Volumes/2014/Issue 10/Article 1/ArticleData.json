It was estimated by the Russian Academy of Science and the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) that the meteor entered Earth's atmosphere at a speed of approximately 33-40 km/s. The energy released by the meteor is on the level of hundreds of kilotons of TNT. The threat posed by such falling meteors and Earth-crossing asteroids (ECAs) cannot be excluded as one of the most unpredictable risks to Earth and humans.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "15", "date_publication": "Oct. 2014", "inspec": "14778149", "date": "Oct. 2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Nov 26 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "10", "pages": "4 - 15", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Xiangyuan Zeng", "Shengping Gong", "Junfeng Li"], "keywords": ["asteroids", "meteors", "space vehicles", "AD 2013 02 15", "Earth atmosphere", "Earth-crossing asteroid intercept mission", "Russian Academy of Science", "Russian Ural Mountains", "TNT", "U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "falling meteor", "humans", "solar sail spacecraft", "Asteroids", "Collision avoidance", "Meteors", "NASA", "Space missions", "Space vehicles", "Terrestrial atmosphere", ""], "arnumber": "6966962"}
