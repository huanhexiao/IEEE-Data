Future information fusion solutions require systems design [1], coordination with users [2], metrics of performance [3], and methods of multilevel security [4]. A current trend that can enable all of these services is cloud computing. Cloud computing as defined by NIST is: Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction. [5] Cloud computing provides capabilities (on-demand self service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service) over different types of clouds (private, community, public, and hybrid).", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "16", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "Oct. 2014", "inspec": "14786601", "date": "Oct. 2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Nov 26 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "10", "pages": "16 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Bingwei Liu", "Yu Chen", "Ari Hadiks", "Erik Blasch", "Alex Aved", "Dan Shen", "Genshe Chen"], "keywords": ["cloud computing", "sensor fusion", "NIST", "broad network access", "cloud computing", "data sources", "information fusion", "on-demand network access", "resource pooling", "service provider interaction", "situation awareness", "uncertainty reduction", "Cloud computing", "Computer architecture", "Computer security", "Data models", "Information processing", "NIST", "Peer-to-peer networking", "Robots", "Systems analysis and design", "Virtual machining", ""], "arnumber": "6966964"}
