Starting from a goal-structured representation of the safety arguments, we have shown how the FDAS goals (safety requirements) can be supported by the available evidence. We have also defined some scenarios to help the revision of the safety case that is already constructed. There are several relatively new certification standards mentioned in this article related to IMA system certification, and the avionics industry has little experience in complying with them individually. It is a challenge for integrators that use those certification standards within a unified framework through GSN, and it will be the research direction of our future work.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "26", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "33", "date_publication": "Oct. 2014", "inspec": "14778148", "date": "Oct. 2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Nov 26 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "10", "pages": "26 - 33", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Xueqiang Shen", "Yan Bai"], "keywords": ["aerospace safety", "avionics", "IMA system", "avionics industry", "integrated modular avionics system", "Aerospace electronics", "Aircraft", "Computer architecture", "Modular construction", "Safety", ""], "arnumber": "6966966"}
