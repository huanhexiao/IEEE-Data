To meet the future challenge of low-cost access to space, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) envisaged plans to develop systems that are recoverable and reusable, besides adopting effcient propulsion systems like air-breathing rockets. Advanced Technology Vehicle (ATV) D01 is ISRO's new-generation high-performance sounding rocket vehicle offering a cost-effective test bed for demonstrating air-breathing propulsion. Experiments with scramjet technology testing are carried out at Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) SHAR, Sriharikota. For this experiment, ATV-D01 is confgured as a two-stage, un-guided, spinning, fin-stabilized vehicle with two protruding passive scramjet engines. The authors describe the design and implementation of real-time event activation command generation, uplinking methodology, and validation practices, followed by results of the ATV-D01 test flight at SDSC SHAR.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "May 2014", "inspec": "14416049", "date": "May 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 27 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "5", "pages": "18 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Rayi Varaprasad", "Rajendran Gnanasambanthan", "Jiguru Venkata Narasimha Ravikumar", "Chandra Jagadeesh Reddy Pamireddy", "Chandravel Ramsenthil", "Kandi Haribabu", "Vellanki Seshagiri Rao"], "keywords": ["aerospace computing", "aerospace control", "real-time systems", "rockets", "ATV", "ATV-D01 test flight", "ISRO advanced technology vehicles", "Indian space research organisation", "SDSC", "Satish Dhawan space centre", "air breathing rockets", "ground based real-time auto commanding system", "passive scramjet engines", "real-time event activation command generation", "rocket vehicle", "space transportation systems", "uplinking methodology", "Economics", "Government", "India", "Radar tracking", "Real-time systems", "Rockets", "Space vehicles", "Vehicle dynamics", ""], "arnumber": "6845171"}
