This increases the pressure on airport operators and air navigation service providers to find new ways of reducing noise levels in the vicinity of airports without adversely infiuencing airport capacity. Especially for airports in densely populated areas, the implementation of curved or segmented approach procedures is promising, as discussed, for example, in [1]. Considering an approach scenario as depicted in Figure 1, at which aircraft approaching runway B inevitably overfly a noise-sensitive area (red pentagons), an alternative segmented routing that guides aircraft around these areas is advantageous.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "34", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "39", "date_publication": "May 2014", "inspec": "14400864", "date": "May 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 27 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "5", "pages": "34 - 39", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Christian Hanses"], "keywords": ["acoustic noise", "aerospace safety", "air traffic", "airports", "vehicle routing", "Europe", "United States", "air navigation service providers", "air traffic growth rate", "airport capacity", "airport operators", "alternative segmented routing", "densely populated areas", "noise level reduction", "noise-sensitive area", "runway", "safety concept", "segmented independent parallel approaches", "Air safety", "Air traffic control", "Aircraft navigation", "Airports", "Delays", "Radar tracking", "Safety", ""], "arnumber": "6845175"}
