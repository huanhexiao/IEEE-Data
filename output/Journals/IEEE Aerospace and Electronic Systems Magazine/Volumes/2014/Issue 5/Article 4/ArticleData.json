A traditional circuit test structure is shown. Test stimuli are applied to the circuit under test (CUT), and test responses are analyzed so as to determine any fault exists. Traditional testing is faced with several serious challenges. First, larger scale IC testing leads to a higher requirement of storage capacity. Second, more test channels and long test application time (TAT) are needed. Third, some kinds of interconnect faults, such as delay faults, may only occur at high frequency of signal changes. In order to guarantee high quality of testing, at-speed testing becomes imperative. All of these lead to an unaccept-ably increasing cost for automatic testing equipment (ATE).", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "33", "date_publication": "May 2014", "inspec": "14400863", "date": "May 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 27 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "5", "pages": "25 - 33", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Tieqiao Liu", "Jishun Kuang", "Zhiqiang You", "Shuo Cai"], "keywords": ["automatic test equipment", "clocks", "fault simulation", "integrated circuit interconnections", "integrated circuit reliability", "integrated circuit testing", "ATE", "at-speed testing", "automatic testing equipment", "circuit test structure", "circuit under test", "delay faults", "deterministic test generation", "integrated circuit reliability", "interconnect faults", "larger scale IC testing", "signal changes", "storage capacity", "test application time", "test channels", "test responses", "test stimuli", "test-per-clock testing", "Circuit faults", "Clocks", "Fault diagnosis", "Generators", "Integrated circuit testing", "Pattern matching", "Shift registers", ""], "arnumber": "6845173"}
