The system is based on multiobjective optimization algorithms providing solutions that are on the so-called Pareto optimal front. The solutions are a trade-off among different objectives, including surveillance risk, area coverage, and mission costs. In general, the inclusion of an objective in the multiobjective vector function is application dependent.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "11", "date_publication": "May 2014", "inspec": "14400862", "date": "May 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 27 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "5", "pages": "4 - 11", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Raffaele Grasso", "Paolo Braca", "John Osler", "Jim Hansen", "Peter Willett"], "keywords": ["marine engineering", "optimisation", "Pareto optimal front", "area coverage", "counter piracy operation support", "improved maritime traffic situational awareness", "mission costs", "multiobjective optimization algorithms", "optimal asset network planning", "resource allocation", "satellite AIS coverage", "surveillance risk", "International relations", "Marine vehicles", "Piracy", "Satellites", "Sensors", "Surveillance", ""], "arnumber": "6845169"}
