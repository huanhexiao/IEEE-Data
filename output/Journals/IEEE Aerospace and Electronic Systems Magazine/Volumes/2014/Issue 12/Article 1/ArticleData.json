Those comprehensive architectures are prerequisite for further research on fractionated spacecraft, such as cluster operations. The functional architecture specifies that there are four resource components; i.e., HBD component, DRSC component, MDP component, and LVDS component, to enable the fractionated space infrastructure to support multiple EO payloads. The physical architecture is derived by means of AHP, and the winner architecture consists of four heterogeneous modules to host the aforementioned four resource components separately. The organizational architecture is designed in such a way that each module is modeled as an agent and the fractionated system is organized through three layers; namely, the planner, allocator, and local controllers. The planner belonging to the higher level layer decomposes abstract high-level goals into cooperative tasks that satisfy temporal and resources constraints. And then the allocator from the middleware layer assigns the generated tasks to each module, which in the end accomplishes the assigned tasks with the onboard controller that belongs to the lower level layer. From both the physical and organizational perspective, the developed space infrastructure is able to self-adapt, self-optimize, and self-configure to dynamic changes in various local environmental conditions, and therefore fulfills the nontraditional requirements of long-term EO missions.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "6", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "17", "date_publication": "Dec. 2014", "inspec": "14867566", "date": "Dec. 2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 20 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "12", "pages": "6 - 17", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Jing Chu", "Jian Guo", "Eberhard Gill"], "keywords": ["organisational aspects", "space vehicles", "AHP", "DRSC component", "HBD component", "LVDS component", "MDP component", "allocator", "components large volume data storage", "cooperative tasks", "fractionated space infrastructure", "functional architectures", "heterogeneous modules", "local controllers", "long-term Earth observation missions", "middleware layer", "mission data processor", "multiple EO payloads", "multiple data relay satellite communication component", "onboard controller", "organizational architectures", "physical architectures", "planner", "resource components", "resource constraints", "temporal constraints", "winner architecture", "Cluster approximation", "Collision avoidance", "Computer architecture", "Decision support systems", "Design methodology", "Distributed databases", "Memory", "Payloads", "Power generation", "Space vehicles", "Wireless communication", ""], "arnumber": "7015508"}
