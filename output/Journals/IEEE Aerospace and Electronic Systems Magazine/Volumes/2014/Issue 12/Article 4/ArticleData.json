The tile is completely modular and flexible in design and can be used in any desired configuration. An innovative approach to distributed power management in small satellites simplifies the distributed power management functions in the satellites. All housekeeping management has been managed using UML, which makes the control of every module quite easy.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "38", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "41", "date_publication": "Dec. 2014", "inspec": "14867565", "date": "Dec. 2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 20 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "12", "pages": "38 - 41", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Muhammad Mughal"], "keywords": ["artificial satellites", "solar cell arrays", "solar power satellites", "space power generation", "UML", "distributed power management functions", "flexible module-based architecture", "housekeeping management", "innovative design", "modular small satellites", "smart panel bodies", "solar panels", "spacecraft design", "spacecraft harness mass", "Design methodology", "Modular construction", "Partial discharges", "Power generation", "Program processors", "Satellites", "Solar energy", "Solar panels", "Voltage control", ""], "arnumber": "7015716"}
