Our approach exploits tracker feedback to address challenges for detection, false alarm mitigation, geolocation, and tracking in an urban surveillance environment. The authors presented a mathematical framework for processing multichannel SAR data in order to mitigate the combined effects of moving target defocus and strong clutter interference. The algorithm uses MRP adaptively in a STAP framework to focus up moving vehicles and enhance signal to clutter ratios. Using simulated data, we illustrated SAR defocus of an accelerating point scatterer and mitigation of the defocus using MRP. For this simulated example, we also presented the potential improvements to SINR loss using our adaptive processing compared to more standard STAP approaches.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "50", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "60", "date_publication": "Jan. 2014", "inspec": "14131410", "date": "Jan. 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 28 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "1", "pages": "50 - 60", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Douglas Page", "Gregory Owirka", "Howard Nichols", "Steven Scarborough", "Michael Minardi", "LeRoy Gorham"], "keywords": ["radar clutter", "radar tracking", "radiofrequency interference", "synthetic aperture radar", "Gotcha radar systems", "accelerating point mitigation", "accelerating point scatterer", "adaptive processing", "clutter interference", "clutter ratios", "false alarm mitigation", "geolocation", "moving target defocus", "moving vehicle detection", "moving vehicle tracking", "moving vehicles", "multichannel SAR data", "tracker feedback", "urban surveillance environment", "Aircraft navigation", "Clutter approximation", "Materials requirements planning", "Radar antennas", "Radar tracking", "Synthetic aperture radar", "Target tracking", "Vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "6750512"}
