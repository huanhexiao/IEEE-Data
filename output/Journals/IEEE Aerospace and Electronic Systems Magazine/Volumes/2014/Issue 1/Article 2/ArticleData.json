The need for nonlinear flight trajectories limits our algorithmic options to DBS, PFA, and CBP, with digital spotlighting used by each to mitigate difficulties with large scene sizes. An analysis of the computational cost of each algorithm was developed, and they were compared for a notional staring SAR application with and without data reuse. The CBP algorithm was consistently the most computationally expensive, at times by an order of magnitude or more, while PFA with and without corrections was frequently the most efficient. However, the CBP algorithm is more amenable to implementation on some computational platforms, such as GPUs and parallel architectures. In limited applications of coarse resolution, the DBS was the most effective.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "20", "date_publication": "Jan. 2014", "inspec": "14131408", "date": "Jan. 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 28 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "1", "pages": "14 - 20", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Brian Rigling", "Wendy Garber", "Robert Hawley", "LeRoy Gorham"], "keywords": ["parallel architectures", "radar imaging", "synthetic aperture radar", "SAR image formation", "coarse resolution", "computational cost", "computational platforms", "digital spotlighting", "nonlinear flight trajectories", "notional staring SAR", "parallel architectures", "persistent SAR imaging", "wide-area SAR imaging", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Approximation methods", "Doppler effect", "Field effect transistors", "Image resolution", "Matched filters", "Performance evaluation", "Radio frequency", "Satellite broadcasting", "Surveillance", "Synthetic aperture radar", ""], "arnumber": "6750508"}
