The authors intended to spotlight individual smaller nonmoving targets within the larger area; however, the images appeared blurred and varied greatly when generated by different passes of the circular SAR radar system. This study concentrated on using widely dispersed QTs combined with an algorithm to correct for both range and phase errors to improve imaging. The wide-angle QT imaging and vehicle identification experiments showed a significant improvement over all orbits and provided higher quality imagery to more robustly perform image registration. Focusing showed significant improvement in visualizations quad-trihedrals and a vehicle.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "Jan. 2014", "inspec": "14131407", "date": "Jan. 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 28 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "1", "pages": "21 - 28", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Kerry E.
