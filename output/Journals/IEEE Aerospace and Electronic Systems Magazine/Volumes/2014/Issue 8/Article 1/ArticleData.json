These nonlinearities pose a challenge for many target tracking algorithms, causing the so-called contact lens problem, which describes the nonlinear appearance of the measurement probability density function in Cartesian coordinates. This tutorial considers methods for measurement filtering (tracking without considering data association) using a single-Gaussian approximation when monostatic and bistatic position and Doppler measurements are available. The connection between the cubature Kalman filter and numerous other filtering algorithms is shown, and the accuracy and consistency of different algorithms are compared through simulation. An effort is made to express the geometric relationships associated with multistatic tracking in a simple vectorial manner. This tutorial focuses on basic tracking, and the companion tutorials \u201cTracking Using 3D Monostatic and Bistatic Measurements in Refractive Environments\u201d and \u201cBasic Tracking Using Nonlinear Continuous-Time Dynamic Models\u201d extend the results to more sophisticated physical models.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "53", "date_publication": "August 2014", "inspec": "14998012", "date": "August 2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Mar 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "8", "pages": "4 - 53", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["David Crouse"], "keywords": ["Doppler measurement", "Kalman filters", "probability", "radar signal processing", "radar tracking", "sonar tracking", "telecommunication engineering education", "Cartesian coordinates", "Cartesian state", "Doppler measurements", "basic tracking", "bistatic position", "contact lens problem", "cubature Kalman filter", "measurement filtering", "measurement probability density function", "monostatic position", "multistatic tracking", "nonlinear 3D bistatic measurement", "nonlinear 3D monostatic measurement", "nonlinear continuous-time dynamic models", "nonlinear transformations", "radar systems", "refractive environments", "single-Gaussian approximation", "sonar systems", "target tracking algorithm", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Dopplermeasurement", "Kalman filters", "Nonlinear filters", "Radar tracking", "Sonar detection", "Three-dimensional displays", "Tutorials", "multistatic radar", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Dopplermeasurements", "Kalman filters", "multistatic radar", "nonlinearfilters", "radar tracking", ""], "arnumber": "7059618"}
