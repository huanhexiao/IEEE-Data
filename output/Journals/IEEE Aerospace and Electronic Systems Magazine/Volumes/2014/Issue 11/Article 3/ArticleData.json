To safely integrate them into the National Airspace System (NAS) [1] requires highly reliable communication links for control and nonpayload communications (CNPC) [2]. Although spectrum allocations for UAS appear to be in place, UAS missions can differ markedly from those of conventional piloted aircraft, and new challenges will appear. One of these challenges is the potential detrimental effects of the air-ground (AG) channel [3]. For past systems that used elevated ground site (GS) antennas in open areas, multipath propagation was minimal. Data rates and bandwidths of past systems were also small, rendering the multipath issue either inconsequential or easily overcome by (sometimes large) transmit power increases or longer latencies. Legacy voice communication systems are also comparatively low rate and forgiving of delay and can usually resort to repetition to improve reliability.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "30", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "35", "date_publication": "Nov. 2014", "inspec": "14820401", "date": "Nov. 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Dec 19 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "11", "pages": "30 - 35", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["David Matolak", "Ruoyu Sun"], "keywords": ["aircraft communication", "autonomous aerial vehicles", "mobile robots", "telecommunication network reliability", "telerobotics", "wireless channels", "AG channel", "CNPC", "GS antennas", "NAS", "UAS", "air ground channel measurements", "air ground channel modeling", "air-ground channel", "control and nonpayload communications", "ground site antennas", "national airspace system", "piloted aircraft", "spectrum allocations", "unmanned aircraft systems", "Aerospace control", "Antenna measurements", "C-band", "Communication systems", "Computational modeling", "Delays", "Frequency measurements", "L-band", "Loss measurement", "Modeling", "Payloads", "Unmanned aerial vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "6992876"}
