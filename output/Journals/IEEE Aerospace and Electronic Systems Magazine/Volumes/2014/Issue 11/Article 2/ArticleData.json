This is, in large part, due to the introduction of the CubeSat standard [1] and the increased capabilities of integrated circuits. These factors have reduced the complexity and size of the subsystems and, consequently, the size of the satellite. The corresponding cost reduction has made satellite missions more attractive to the scientific and academic community.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "22", "volume": "29", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "Nov. 2014", "inspec": "14820403", "date": "Nov. 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Dec 19 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "11", "pages": "22 - 29", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Johan Ludvig Tresvig", "Torfnn Lindem"], "keywords": ["satellite communication", "CubeSat standard", "academic community", "communication system design", "cost reduction", "integrated circuits", "nanosatellite space weather mission", "scientific community", "Aerospace control", "Antenna measurements", "Bit error rate", "Communications systems", "Design methodology", "Nanotechnology", "Receivers", "Satellite broadcasting", "Satellites", "Standards", ""], "arnumber": "6992875"}
