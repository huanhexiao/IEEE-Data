Specifically, we discuss applications to fast-jets. Key requirements are for higher levels of digitisation to provide the performance required in ECCM, STAP, GMTI, and ESM modes. Building radar systems with the key basic building blocks to, as a minimum, enable future realisation of these advanced modes will help to \u00c2\u00bffuture proof\u00c2\u00bf the systems.
