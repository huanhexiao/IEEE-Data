The method of structural synthesis of new systems to solve two problems is examined: 1) Directproblems. After the creation of the morphological array with the help of clusterization, a search of engineering solutions occurs. 2) Inverse problems. The effective search near existing solutions is carried out. The operation of the method is given in three examples: Supertight Re-entry Vehicles, HAPs, and adaptive acoustic systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "Feb. 2010", "inspec": "11220545", "date": "Feb. 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu Apr 01 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "2", "pages": "4 - 10", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Dimitri Rakov", "Alena Timoshina"], "keywords": ["aerospace instrumentation", "HAP", "adaptive acoustic systems", "aerospace products", "clusterization", "engineering solutions", "inverse problems", "morphological array", "prospective technical systems", "structural synthesis", "supertight re-entry vehicles", "Acoustical engineering", "Adaptive systems", "Aerospace engineering", "Automotive engineering", "Inverse problems", "Vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "5442170"}
