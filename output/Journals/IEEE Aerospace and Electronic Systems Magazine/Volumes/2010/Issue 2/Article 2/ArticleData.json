This presents the flight plans generated for these UAV by new generation technologies (genetic algorithms) respecting the constraints of uses of the sensors (angles, distances of recording), the UAV performances (load factor in bend, height of cruise, speed of maximal stamina) as well as the environment of the theatre of operation (relief, meteorology, and restricted zones).", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "14", "date_publication": "Feb. 2010", "inspec": "11208077", "date": "Feb. 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu Apr 01 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "2", "pages": "11 - 14", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Sophie Lentilhac"], "keywords": ["aircraft navigation", "genetic algorithms", "radar imaging", "remotely operated vehicles", "search radar", "sensors", "surveillance", "synthetic aperture radar", "UAV flight plan", "UAV surveillance radar", "generation technologies", "genetic algorithms", "sensor requirements", "surveillance missions", "synthetic aperture radar images", "unmanned air vehicles", "Genetic algorithms", "Meteorology", "Payloads", "Radar imaging", "Surveillance", "Synthetic aperture radar", "Unmanned aerial vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "5442171"}
