As an illustration UWB radar, in medicine and in psychophysiology, for remote measuring of patient's beating of the pulse and respiration is shown. The opportunity of UWB technology application in the other areas is described, including measuring of liquid levels, definition of a position of people in buildings, and position of people in woodlands.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "36", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "42", "date_publication": "Feb. 2010", "inspec": "11208079", "date": "Feb. 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu Apr 01 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "2", "pages": "36 - 42", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Igor Y.
