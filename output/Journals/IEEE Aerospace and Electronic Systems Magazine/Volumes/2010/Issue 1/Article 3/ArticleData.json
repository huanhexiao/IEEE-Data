Herein, the main characteristics and features of a linear microphone array designed for aircraft noise measurement are discussed, and the results obtained from the usage of the array in two different urban placements are presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "Jan. 2010", "inspec": "11208073", "date": "Jan. 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu Apr 01 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "1", "pages": "14 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
