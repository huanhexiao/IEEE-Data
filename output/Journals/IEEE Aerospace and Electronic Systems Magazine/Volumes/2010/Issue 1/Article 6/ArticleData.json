Leveraging these benefits is difficult, owing to a lack of tool support and the detailed architectural knowledge required. To fully exploit the potential of dynamic hardware, a high-level development environment has been created. This development environment has been validated by implementing a reconfigurable AM radio on a software defined radio platform.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "35", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "38", "date_publication": "Jan. 2010", "inspec": "11208076", "date": "Jan. 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu Apr 01 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "1", "pages": "35 - 38", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Stephen Craven", "Peter Athanas"], "keywords": ["field programmable gate arrays", "software radio", "dynamic hardware", "dynamic reconfigurability", "dynamically reconfigurable radios", "field programmable gate arrays", "high-level development environment", "high-level specification", "reconfigurable AM radio", "software defined radio applications", "Application software", "Field programmable gate arrays", "Hardware", "Software radio", ""], "arnumber": "5442152"}
