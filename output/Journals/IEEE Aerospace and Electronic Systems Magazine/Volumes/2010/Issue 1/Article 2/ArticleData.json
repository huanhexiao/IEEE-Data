Development 1) IMA System Integrator 2) Platform and Module Suppliers 3) Application Supplier 2. Certification 1) Certification Authority 2) Certification Applicant 3. Maintenance Organization,This focuses on the development portion of an Open IMA system life-cycle, which is typically performed by several different companies. The number involved in developing an IMA system can reach into the thousands, making effective communication and prioritization of work between development roles and companies essential for meeting project deadlines and goals. This provides a set of recommendations from each of the IMA development roles, for how their development activities could be optimized by the actions (or development process) of those performing the other IMA development roles. These suggestions were drawn from GE Aviation's experience as an IMA System Integrator, Platform Supplier, and Application Supplier on numerous Open IMA development programs.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "13", "date_publication": "Jan. 2010", "inspec": "11208072", "date": "Jan. 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu Apr 01 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "1", "pages": "9 - 13", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Jay Pruiett", "Jeff VanDorp", "Randy Walter"], "keywords": ["aircraft maintenance", "avionics", "open systems", "DO-297", "IMA system integrator", "integrated modular avionics system", "open IMA development", "Aerospace electronics", "Certification", "Communication effectiveness", ""], "arnumber": "5442148"}
