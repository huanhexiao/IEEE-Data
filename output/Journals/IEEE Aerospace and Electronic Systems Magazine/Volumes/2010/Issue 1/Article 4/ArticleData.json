Two representative systems, which are countrywide and airport-based avian radar systems, are surveyed to summarize the state-of-the-art in this research field. Avian radar experimental system built by Beihang University is introduced in detail, including system architecture, performance analysis, and processing algorithm for bird target detection and tracking. This radar is operated in horizontal and vertical positions alternatively for scanning, and some experimental data are collected, respectively, at reservoir and airport. After processing of background subtraction, noise suppression, target information extraction, tracking and data fusion, a fused image containing bird targets and aircraft is provided. Finally, improvement suggestions on radar antenna, processing algorithms and risk assessment models of bird-aircraft strikes are given. Moreover, a scheme for practical systems applications at airport is proposed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "Jan. 2010", "inspec": "11208074", "date": "Jan. 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu Apr 01 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "1", "pages": "19 - 28", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Ning Huansheng", "Chen Weishi", "Mao Xia", "LiJing"], "keywords": ["airborne radar", "object detection", "radar antennas", "radar imaging", "radar tracking", "radionavigation", "target tracking", "airport based avian radar systems", "background subtraction", "bird aircraft strike avoidance radar", "bird aircraft strike hazard avoidance", "bird target detection", "data fusion", "noise suppression", "radar antenna", "target information extraction", "target tracking", "Airports", "Birds", "Hazards", "Object detection", "Performance analysis", "Radar antennas", "Radar imaging", "Radar tracking", "Reservoirs", "Target tracking", ""], "arnumber": "5442150"}
