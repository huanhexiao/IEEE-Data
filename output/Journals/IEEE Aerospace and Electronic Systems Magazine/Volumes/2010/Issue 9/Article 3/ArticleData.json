These tasks were previously held by conventional manned aircrafts. Nowadays, current UAVs employment has brought economic benefits in agriculture, energy, public safety and telecommunication areas, among others, considering operational costs, maintenance, and safety. The Air Force, Army, and Navy under the Brazilian Department of Defense are developing a UAV in the so-called Vei\u0301culo Ae\u0301reo Na\u0303o Tripulado (VANT) Project. The Brazilian Aeronautics Institute of Technology (Instituto Tecnolo\u0301gico de Aerona\u0301utica - ITA) in its Software Engineering Research Group worked in a Preliminary Testing Monitoring Station (PTMS) (Esta\u00e7a\u0303o de Monitoramento de Ensaios Preliminares - EMEP). The PTMS is considered a key part of the VANT Project. Therefore, the major contribution herein reports a complete development life-cycle using state-of-the-art practices provided by System Engineering, Rational Unified Process (RUP), Military Standards, Model-Driven Development (MDD), and Integrated - Computer Aided Software Engineering - Environment (I-CASE-E) tools. Finally, the effective use of these modern approaches has enabled the Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) to be developed, integrated on-time, and to work as expected and specified.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "Sept. 2010", "inspec": "11560016", "date": "Sept. 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu Sep 30 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "9", "pages": "18 - 25", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Diogo Branquinho Ramos", "Denis Silva Loubach", "Adilson Marques da Cunha"], "keywords": ["aerospace computing", "aircraft control", "aircraft testing", "computer aided software engineering", "computerised monitoring", "real-time systems", "remotely operated vehicles", "Air Force", "Army", "Brazilian Aeronautics Institute of Technology", "Brazilian Department of Defense", "I-CASE-E tools", "MDD", "Navy", "PTMS", "RUP", "UAS", "UAV tracking", "VANT Project", "Veiculo Aereo Nao Tripulado Project", "agriculture", "distributed real time monitoring system", "energy", "integrated computer aided software engineering environment tools", "military standards", "model driven development", "preliminary testing monitoring station", "public safety", "rational unified process", "software engineering research", "system engineering", "telecommunication areas", "unmanned aerial vehicles", "unmanned aircraft system", "Computational modeling", "Data models", "Ethernet networks", "Monitoring", "Real time systems", "Unmanned aerial vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "5592987"}
