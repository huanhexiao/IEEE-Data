In certain situations, when compared with wireless communication, it proves to be more effective by providing higher data rates at reduced size and cost. Current FSO technology transmits data, video, and voice communications at a bandwidth of up to 2.5 Gbps. FSO system transceivers rely on a line-of-sight connection to maintain a continuous exchange of data. Because atmospheric conditions can greatly affect FSO communications, facilitating continuous alignment requirements has been the primary concentration of mobile FSO research to date. This introduces a fully automatic, advanced FSO alignment system that has been tested to provide both continuous and simultaneous transmission and reception of data and modulated signal during mobile conditions. Building sway and aerial-to-base station communication were considered in this study.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "26", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "34", "date_publication": "Sept. 2010", "inspec": "11560017", "date": "Sept. 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu Sep 30 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "9", "pages": "26 - 34", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Gabriel A.
