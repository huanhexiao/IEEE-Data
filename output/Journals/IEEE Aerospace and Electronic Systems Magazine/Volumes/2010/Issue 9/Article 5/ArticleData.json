Using Iridium's satellite network as a gateway, satellites in LEO may achieve near continuous communications with Earth. This discusses the use of the Iridium network for nanosatellite satellite communications by NASA's Florida Space Grant Consortium funded researchers at Florida International University (FIU). Specifically, this focuses on FIU's Florida University SA Tellite (FUNSAT) IV competition award winning payload submissions, named PicoPanther, orbiting in a sun synchronous polar orbit. An introduction to the network and hardware is presented as well as simulation results. An analysis of cost, Doppler Effect shifts, and possible uses are also performed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "35", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "39", "date_publication": "Sept. 2010", "inspec": "11560018", "date": "Sept. 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu Sep 30 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "9", "pages": "35 - 39", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Henric Boiardt", "Christian Rodriguez"], "keywords": ["Doppler effect", "nanotechnology", "satellite communication", "Doppler effect shifts", "FIU Florida University SA Tellite IV competition", "Florida International University", "Iridium satellite network", "NASA Florida Space Grant Consortium", "PicoPanther", "low Earth orbit nanosatellite communications", "Low earth orbit satellites", "Nanoscale devices", "Orbits", "Satellite communication", ""], "arnumber": "5592989"}
