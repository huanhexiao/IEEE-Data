Even though the SCARLETT Project starts from concepts and technology which is already available in modern aircrafts, the project's vision is to push the state of the art far beyond what is available today, with substantial consequences for the aerospace industry. SYSGO is one of the key members of the SCARLETT Project and is responsible for the evaluation and specification of the platform software requirements, including multi-core support. With the operating system PikeOS, a field-proven implementation of the concept of SSV (Safe and Secure Virtualization) technology, SYSGO provides the foundation for the realization of various components within these projects, ranging from Core Processing Modules, Remote Data Concentrators and Remote Electronics, as well as Simulation Environments. This provides a short overview of the project's framework, the key drivers, the goals, and the anticipated innovations. It presents the new architecture for electronic device integration proposed by the SCARLETT Project together with the resulting requirements for the platform software. In addition to SCARLETT Project overview, this discusses specific software aspects resulting from the project and how they can be addressed with a safe and secure virtualization technology of a modern operating system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "10", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Oct. 2010", "inspec": "11640629", "date": "Oct. 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 11 00:00:00 EST 2010", "issue": "10", "pages": "10 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Rudolf Fuchsen"], "keywords": ["avionics", "multiprocessing systems", "operating systems (computers)", "European Research Project", "IMA NextGen", "IMA modules", "PikeOS", "SCARLETT project", "SYSGO", "aerospace industry", "core processing modules", "modern aircrafts", "multicore support", "operating system", "platform software requirements", "remote data concentrators", "remote electronics", "safe virtualization", "secure virtualization", "simulation environments", "Computer architecture", "Next generation networking", "Security", "Software", "Strategic planning", ""], "arnumber": "5631720"}
