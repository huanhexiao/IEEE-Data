One difference between TIP and CBT X-ray images is the algorithm used to merge virtual threat items into X-ray images of passenger bags, resulting in different color nuances. In this study, we tested the influence of merging algorithms on threat object detection performance, reaction time and confidence rating of 12 airport security screeners. The image merging algorithms of the individually adaptive CBT X-Ray Tutor were used. We have found that the hit rate was higher for TIP images compared to CBT images. Accordingly, the mean of confidence ratings was increased for TIP images. The reaction times tended to be shorter for TIP images. The results of our study indicate that the CBT merging algorithm used in this study is more realistic than the tested TIP image merging algorithm.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "33", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "38", "date_publication": "Oct. 2010", "inspec": "11640633", "date": "Oct. 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 11 00:00:00 EST 2010", "issue": "10", "pages": "33 - 38", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Claudia C. von Bastian", "Adrian Schwaninger", "Stefan Michel"], "keywords": ["X-ray imaging", "airports", "image colour analysis", "image scanners", "object detection", "security of data", "CBT X-ray image algorithm", "TIP image merging algorithm", "airport security screeners", "aviation security screening", "computer-based X-ray image interpretation training", "image merging algorithms", "threat image projection", "threat object detection performance", "virtual threat items", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Color", "Image recognition", "Training", "Weapons", "X-ray imaging", ""], "arnumber": "5631724"}
