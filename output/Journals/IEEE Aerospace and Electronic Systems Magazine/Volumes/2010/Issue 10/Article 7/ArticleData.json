In terms of physical architecture, even if the brick concept is more current at mid-term, the tile concept is investigated for conformal and/or multifunction phased array antennas: a 3-dimensional module will lead to a drastic reduction of size and weight of the antennas. MMICs are always the key components, with evolution toward multifunction chips, and new processes like GaN, SiGe, MEMS power switches. Concerning the packaging, a technological roadmap indicates different capabilities: 1) thick film multilayer ceramic circuits, 2) co-fired ceramics based on LTCC or HTCC processes, 3) surface-mounted packages on printed circuits boards, and 4) 3D architectures. For the interconnections domain, it is now more important to be compatible with the level of integration required for the microwave modules: fuzz buttons, flex, sub-miniature connectors. AH of these technologies mastered by Thales are dual use for Airborne and Space, Military and Civilian applications.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "39", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "43", "date_publication": "Oct. 2010", "inspec": "11640628", "date": "Oct. 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 11 00:00:00 EST 2010", "issue": "10", "pages": "39 - 43", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Y.
