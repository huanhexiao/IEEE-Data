This approach consists of a layered architecture that isolates applications from underlying hardware and software elements such as operating systems, middlewares, communication fabrics, and computer platforms. The framework also consists of a set of component libraries that are being populated as the framework is applied in an expanding series of application domains. Easy swap ability for the library components or newly-developed components along with a high degree of hardware independence allows systems built using this infrastructure to be easily maintained and upgraded.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "20", "date_publication": "Oct. 2010", "inspec": "11640630", "date": "Oct. 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 11 00:00:00 EST 2010", "issue": "10", "pages": "17 - 20", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["John A.
