Based on the systematic usage of risk evaluation, it helps in actions priorities definition. Several organisations generate actions belonging to separate business goals, sometimes contradictory. Moreover, maintenance, quality, process, research and development organisations use different approaches to define actions priorities. In this case study, more than 400 engineers participate in this process and generating between 20 to 50 action sets monthly (each set can contain around 3 actions). This demonstrates that it is possible to unify action plans management. This has been achieved by developing a model of management system integrating several quality methods. The proposed tool enables local managers to have a clear picture of on-going and planned actions for their areas. For plant managers, it smoothes the coordination among organizations.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "June 2010", "inspec": "11447003", "date": "June 2010", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 26 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "6", "pages": "4 - 8", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Aymen Mili", "A.
