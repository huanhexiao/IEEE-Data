The clusters of creative design activities are associated with the focus aimed at achieving a certain task. We show that there are four types of focus for clusters of creative design activities identified with respect to a desired output to be produced. The outputs are termed: scope, ideas, prototypes, and product. The research has also shown that there are four levels of granularity of focus clusters of creative design activities depending on relationships between different outputs. The switching focus between the clusters of design activities can be seen according to three types of contextualised cues: dreamer, realist, and critic.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "30", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "34", "date_publication": "June 2010", "inspec": "11447009", "date": "June 2010", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 26 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "6", "pages": "30 - 34", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Mohammad Ibrahim", "Marie Bassford", "Helen Ackerley", "Vincent Cornelius"], "keywords": ["behavioural sciences", "design engineering", "innovation management", "organisational aspects", "planning", "creative design activities", "creative design dynamics", "creative systems", "innovation processes", "Design engineering", "Design for manufacture", "Design optimization", "Dynamics", "Prototypes", ""], "arnumber": "5525318"}
