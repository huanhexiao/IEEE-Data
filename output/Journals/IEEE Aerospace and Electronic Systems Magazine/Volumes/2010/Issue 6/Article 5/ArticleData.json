Specifically, investigators thinned silicon die, electrically connecting them with circuits on flexible (liquid crystal polymer (LCP) and polyimide (PI)) circuits, using gold thermo-compression flip chip bonding, and embedding them within the material. The influence of temperature and flexure on the electrical behavior of active embedded assemblies was evaluated. In addition, the long-term thermal cycle resistance of the passive daisy chain assemblies was determined within the Mil-Std (-55\u00b0 to +125\u00b0C), extreme low #1 (-125\u00b0 to +85\u00b0C), and extreme low #2 (-125\u00b0 to +125\u00b0C) temperature ranges. The results of these evaluations will be discussed, along with the application of this technology for future NASA missions.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "June 2010", "inspec": "11447008", "date": "June 2010", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 26 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "6", "pages": "25 - 29", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Linda Del Castillo", "Alina Moussessian", "Ryan McPherson", "Tan Zhang", "Zhenwei Hou", "Robert Dean", "R.
