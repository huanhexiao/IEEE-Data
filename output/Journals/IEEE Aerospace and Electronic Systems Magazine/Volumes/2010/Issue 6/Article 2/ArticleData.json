The National Aviation Safety Strategic Plan (NASSP), developed by the Safety Working Group of the JPDO, focuses on establishing the goals, objectives, and strategies needed to realize the safety objectives of the NextGen Integrated Plan. The three goals of the NASSP are Safer Practices, Safer Systems, and Safer Worldwide. Safer Practices emphasizes an integrated systematic approach to safety risk management through implementation of formalized Safety Management Systems (SMS) that incorporate safety data analysis processes, and the enhancement of methods for ensuring safety an inherent characteristic of NextGen. Safer Systems emphasizes implementation of safety-enhancing technologies, which will improve safety for human-centered interfaces and enhance the safety of airborne and ground-based systems. Safer Worldwide encourages coordinating the adoption of the safer practices and safer systems technologies, policies, and procedures worldwide, such that the maximum level of safety is achieved across air transportation system boundaries. This introduces the NASSP and its development, and focuses on the Safer Systems elements of the NASSP, which incorporates three objectives for NextGen systems: 1) provide risk reducing system interfaces; 2) provide safety enhancements for airborne systems; and 3) provide safety enhancements for ground-based systems. Our goal is to expose avionics and air traffic management system developers to NASSP objectives and Safer Systems strategies.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "14", "date_publication": "June 2010", "inspec": "11447005", "date": "June 2010", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 26 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "6", "pages": "9 - 14", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Stephen Darr", "Wendell Ricks", "Katherine A.
