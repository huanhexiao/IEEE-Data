This technology demonstrator, designated Captor Active Electronically Scanned Array Radar (CAESAR), enables E-scan capability to be fully exploited by the existing Captor radar, while retaining all features and capabilities of the original system. Advanced waveforms, designed and optimized for electronically-scanned radar systems, have been evaluated in recent CAESAR flight trials. Production of the CAESAR system will address repackaging of the AESA and associated components to minimize mass and volume, reduce cost, and ensure ease of supportability. CAESAR has demonstrated that AESA benefits can be provided within the existing Captor framework, enhancing sensor capability while retaining existing Eurofighter Typhoon interfaces.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "20", "date_publication": "June 2010", "inspec": "11447006", "date": "June 2010", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 26 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "6", "pages": "15 - 20", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
