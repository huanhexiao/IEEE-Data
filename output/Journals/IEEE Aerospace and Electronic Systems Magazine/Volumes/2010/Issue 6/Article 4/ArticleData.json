In addition to ensuring that basic functionality is satisfied, the systems integrator must maximize the system's flexibility and reliability while minimizing weight and cost of change. With the introduction of integrated modular architectures (IMA) based on open standards, many traditional integration issues have been greatly improved. However, additional integration responsibilities arise due to having a large number of functions developed by independent suppliers all sharing the same physical resources.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "June 2010", "inspec": "11447007", "date": "June 2010", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 26 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "6", "pages": "21 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Todd Schavey", "Shane Duba"], "keywords": ["aerospace computing", "avionics", "computer architecture", "military aircraft", "IMA", "avionics systems integration", "commercial aircraft", "integrated modular architectures", "integration issues", "military aircraft", "model-driven integration", "streamline", "virtual integration", "Aerospace components", "Aerospace electronics", "Cost function", "Modular construction", "Standards", ""], "arnumber": "5525316"}
