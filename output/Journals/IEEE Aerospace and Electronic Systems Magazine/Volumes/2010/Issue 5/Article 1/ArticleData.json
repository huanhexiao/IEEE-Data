While a mentoring program existed previously, it was not widely utilized and eventually lost support. The new program was designed to focus on the staff members' needs and desires for career growth and an opportunity for those skilled with years of expertise in the space domain to share their wisdom and gain a new perspective. Especially in an era where budgets are constrained, mentoring is a cost effective method to ensure continuity of knowledge and enthusiasm in staff. This discusses the motivations for starting the program, the hurdles involved, and the benefits derived during the first few years of APL's new Space Department mentoring program. This includes the design details of the program, as well as successes and lessons learned to date.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "11", "date_publication": "May 2010", "inspec": "11373443", "date": "May 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu Jun 17 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "5", "pages": "4 - 11", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Brenda K.
