Although fully autonomous \u201csense-and-avoid\u201d or \u201cdetect-and-avoid\u201d systems are in development, none are currently certified. Thus existing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operations are limited to case-by-case restricted airspace or require escort by manned aircraft. Many UAVs are equipped with at least a forward-looking camera. In the transition between current technology and future fully autonomous, certified sense-and-avoid systems, it seems reasonable to require a ground-based operator to perform the see-and-avoid function. This discusses the flight-testing performed to establish air traffic detection ranges for low-time pilots, and for a low-cost UAV camera system. The system was evaluated to determine if it could provide the equivalent see-and-avoid performance as the tested pilots.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "36", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "42", "date_publication": "May 2010", "inspec": "11373447", "date": "May 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu Jun 17 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "5", "pages": "36 - 42", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Ryan J.
