For example, the sensors of a cognitive radar system might use the illumination signals to carry broadcast data, allowing the sharing of target information. Herein, we postulate that it would be possible to implement a cognitive version of Passive Coherent Location (PCL) which has much in common with the broad cognitive radar concept, but adapts only to the waveforms it senses in the environment, and exploits those that are most useful to it for target detection. In addition, it would model the terrain to improve coverage and provide countermeasures against direct signal saturation. By its name, PCL does not transmit, but relies on emissions from other radiating systems, such as broadcast services, other radars, cellular radio, WiFi, and so on. It is clear that such a system, consisting of multiple, cooperating receivers, can achieve excellent performance in the presence of deliberate jamming, difficult terrain, and attempts at target stealth. In the civilian radar domain, the technology offers opportunities for bandwidth conservation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "12", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "17", "date_publication": "May 2010", "inspec": "11373444", "date": "May 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu Jun 17 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "5", "pages": "12 - 17", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Michael Inggs"], "keywords": ["cognitive radio", "radar tracking", "target tracking", "WiFi", "cellular radio", "civilian radar domain", "cognitive radar", "direct signal saturation", "generic radar system", "illumination signals", "passive coherent location", "target tracking", "transmission waveforms", "Broadcasting", "Lighting", "Passive radar", "Radar countermeasures", "Radar detection", "Radar tracking", "Sensor phenomena and characterization", "Sensor systems", "Target recognition", "Target tracking", ""], "arnumber": "5486536"}
