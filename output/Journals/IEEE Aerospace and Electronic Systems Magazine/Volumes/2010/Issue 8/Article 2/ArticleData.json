First, it will be explained why Extended Air Defence (that is Air and Missile Defence) requires a multi-function, multi-beam radar technology: then M3R radar will be described and the M3R innovative antenna concept implemented in the M3R programme to the Thales Building Block Product Policy. The final part shows how M3R antenna architecture is a step towards fully digital radar and multi-static operating mode.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Aug. 2010", "inspec": "11476816", "date": "Aug. 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 19 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "8", "pages": "11 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Odile Adrian"], "keywords": ["analogue-digital conversion", "beam steering", "defence industry", "military radar", "missiles", "multibeam antennas", "radar antennas", "M3R AESA technology", "M3R active electronically steered antenna system", "Thales building block product policy", "air defence", "digital beam forming", "digital radar", "multibeam radar technology", "multistatic operating mode", "Jamming", "Radar", "Radar antennas", "Receivers", ""], "arnumber": "5552607"}
