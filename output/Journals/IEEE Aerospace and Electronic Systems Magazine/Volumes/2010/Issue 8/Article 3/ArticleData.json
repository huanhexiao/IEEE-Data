In order to avoid failure of components during operation, many aircraft parts are replaced earlier than necessary leading to higher costs that could be reduced if the degree of damage in the component material could be determined non-destructively. Millimeter and Sub-millimeter waves are ideally suited for this purpose because of their ability to penetrate through dielectric substances and obscurants such as pain, oil, and epoxy commonly found on the surfaces of aircraft.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "19", "date_publication": "Aug. 2010", "inspec": "11476817", "date": "Aug. 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 19 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "8", "pages": "17 - 19", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Izaak Kemp", "Melissa Peterson", "Carla Benton", "Douglas T.
