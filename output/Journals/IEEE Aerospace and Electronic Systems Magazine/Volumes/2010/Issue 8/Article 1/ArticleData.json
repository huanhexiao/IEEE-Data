The proposed approach is not affected by the strength of the microwave, and is more accurate than the conventional time of arrival approaches. Methods based on limited and varying information of markers is discussed. Simple applications and experimentation based on augmenting a motorized wheelchair for vision applications is discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "Aug. 2010", "inspec": "11476815", "date": "Aug. 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 19 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "8", "pages": "4 - 10", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Kevin R.
