Due to the common use of FM radio, the traits of low estate requirement and the convenience in broadcasting, RDS is suitable for use in wireless transmission of large-range and low-load data. This proposes the application of RDS in the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) for low altitude flights. The real-time surveillance information from the airport control center of low attitude flights can be wirelessly transmitted in real-time to the RDS receiver in the aircrafts. Because of the low-price of RDS broadcast station and the widespread use of RDS receiver contributed by the application of RDS-TMC for car navigation system in recent years, using RDS as the redundancy communication system in low altitude flights is plausible in almost every aspect, Nevertheless, one thing left to be desired is the slow transferring speed (1187.5 bps) of RDS, which is amended in this research by particularly designed data formats to reduce the information load in each transmission. As a result, the application proposed herein is feasible.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "April 2010", "inspec": "11313668", "date": "April 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu May 20 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "4", "pages": "25 - 29", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
