A two-dimensional aircraft simulation environment has been developed to evaluate the optimal link budget of an antenna system coupled with a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) base station positioned above 45,000 feet in a designated elliptical orbital pattern in an effort to acquire broader and longer communication coverage. This will analyze the signal excess results of both an omni-directional conventional antenna system (CAS) and a switched-beam smart antenna system (SBSAS) with multiple mobile ground users present. Collectively, these results constitute a basis for low-risk implementation for a high altitude airborne deployable cellular base station.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "30", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "36", "date_publication": "April 2010", "inspec": "11313669", "date": "April 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu May 20 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "4", "pages": "30 - 36", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Suzanna Denton", "Paul Zavidniak", "William Hodgkiss"], "keywords": ["adaptive antenna arrays", "aerospace simulation", "aircraft communication", "cellular radio", "code division multiple access", "CDMA", "code division multiple access", "high altitude airborne cellular base stations", "mobile communication coverage", "omnidirectional conventional antenna system", "signal gain", "signal spatial structure", "switched-beam smart antenna system", "two-dimensional aircraft simulation environment", "Adaptive arrays", "Aircraft", "Base stations", "Content addressable storage", "Directive antennas", "Interference", "Mobile antennas", "Mobile communication", "Receiving antennas", "Signal analysis", ""], "arnumber": "5467654"}
