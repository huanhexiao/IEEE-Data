This project aims to design and develop an Underwater Autonomous Robot, able to perceive the environment by means of acoustic and optic sensors, and equipped with a robotic arm in order to autonomously perform simple intervention tasks. A complete simulation environment, including this new concept of robot, has been developed and is presented as a preliminary result.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "32", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "36", "date_publication": "Nov. 2010", "inspec": "11653987", "date": "Nov. 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 18 00:00:00 EST 2010", "issue": "11", "pages": "32 - 36", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["G.
