Illustrated by examples, we discuss along which lines tracking is likely to evolve into a key technology enabling design and development of real-world surveillance and control systems. Four aspects are of particular importance: (1) extraction of higher JDL level information on target characteristics from precision tracks, (2) tracking-derived anomaly detection, (3) exploitation of attribute information from poor resolution sensors over a time window, (4) in-depth integration of context information enabling information extraction even from unwanted propagation phenomena.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Nov. 2010", "inspec": "11653984", "date": "Nov. 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 18 00:00:00 EST 2010", "issue": "11", "pages": "11 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Wolfgang Koch"], "keywords": ["surveillance", "target tracking", "JDL level information", "information extraction", "propagation phenomena", "real world surveillance", "target tracking", "Control systems", "Information processing", "Surveillance", "Target tracking", ""], "arnumber": "5638800"}
