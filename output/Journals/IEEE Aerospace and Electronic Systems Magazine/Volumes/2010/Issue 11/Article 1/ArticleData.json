Research has shown this knowledge is tacit and based in experience. However, with nearly one-third of the industry's employees eligible for retirement, this systems-level knowledge is at risk of being lost. This focuses on the team as the unit of analysis and the elements of design process and team culture that foster collaborative systems thinking teams. Eight pilot interviews, ten full case studies, and 14 abbreviated case studies were used to explore \u201ccollaborative systems thinking,\u201d or team-level systems thinking. From these data, a definition of collaborative systems thinking is derived and generalizations about collaborative systems thinking teams are presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "Nov. 2010", "date": "Nov. 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 18 00:00:00 EST 2010", "issue": "11", "pages": "4 - 10", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Caroline Twomey Lamb", "Donna H.
