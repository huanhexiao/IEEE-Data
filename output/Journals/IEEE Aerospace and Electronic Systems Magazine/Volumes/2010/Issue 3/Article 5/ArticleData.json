Analysis of complex radar systems, such as multistatic and netted designs (see Figure 1) is often intractable without the application of a dedicated radar simulation system. Recent research into radar simulation has focused primarily on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems [1] and is not entirely applicable to traditional radar systems concerned with the location and tracking of remote targets. A complete simulator has been designed for the accurate simulation of raw returns in complex, multistatic, and netted radars, and is applicable to pulsed and continuous wave (CW) systems, and both active and passive radar systems. The Flexible Simulator for Multistatic Radars (FERS) can be used to simulate radar systems with arbitrary waveforms and arbitrary numbers of receivers, transmitters, and scatterers. Herein, algorithms for the simulation of raw radar return signals are presented, based on interpolation and modification of the transmitted signal and modeling of the radar hardware and environment. The algorithms are expected to be especially valuable for the simulation of emerging radar technologies, such as Passive Coherent Location (PCL) [2], netted radar and phased array radar. Preliminary results, presented herein, suggest that these algorithms can simulate physical systems with excellent accuracy.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "March 2010", "inspec": "11340788", "date": "March 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu May 13 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "3", "pages": "27 - 29", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Yoann Paichard", "Marc Brooker", "Michael Inggs"], "keywords": ["CW radar", "phased array radar", "synthetic aperture radar", "waveform analysis", "SAR systems", "continuous wave systems", "flexible simulator for multistatic radars", "netted text radar waveforms evaluation", "signal level simulator", "synthetic aperture radar", "Analytical models", "Hardware", "Passive radar", "Performance evaluation", "Phased arrays", "Radar applications", "Radar scattering", "Radar tracking", "Synthetic aperture radar", "Target tracking", ""], "arnumber": "5463953"}
