This extensively explores the potential applications of passive surveillance radar using cell phone base station signals for various scenarios such as ground traffic monitoring, coastal and air surveillance, and through-the-wall motion detections. These promising experimental results demonstrated that such systems can be an attractive, low-cost alternative solution for various applications and prospectively as a complement to traditional active radar systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "10", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "March 2010", "inspec": "11340786", "date": "March 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu May 13 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "3", "pages": "10 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Hongbo Sun", "Danny K.
