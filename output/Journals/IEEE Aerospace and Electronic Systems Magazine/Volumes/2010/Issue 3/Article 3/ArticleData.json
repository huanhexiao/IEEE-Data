The main characteristic of the new radar system is the possibility of simultaneously measuring the (static or dynamic) displacement of several points of a structure with high sensitivity. This describes the major characteristics of the microwave interferometer and its application to ambient vibration testing of full-scale bridges.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "March 2010", "inspec": "11340787", "date": "March 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu May 13 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "3", "pages": "19 - 26", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Gaetano De Pasquale", "Giulia Bernardini", "Pier Paolo Ricci", "Carmelo Gentile"], "keywords": ["displacement measurement", "dynamic testing", "interferometers", "microwave measurement", "sensitivity", "ambient vibration testing", "civil engineering structures", "displacement measurement", "dynamic testing", "full-scale bridges", "microwave interferometer", "radar techniques", "sensitivity", "vibration monitoring", "Accelerometers", "Bridges", "Data acquisition", "Electronic equipment testing", "Frequency", "Intrusion detection", "Microwave theory and techniques", "Radar applications", "Radar measurements", "System testing", ""], "arnumber": "5463952"}
