Significant techniques that permitted monopulse tracking radars to achieve accurate tracking with high efficiency are discussed, including sum-and-difference antenna feed networks, multi-horn and multi-mode feeds, precision mechanical pedestals, and space-fed arrays. The discussion concentrates on surface-based radars, but many of the techniques apply to airborne radars and missile seekers developed during the same periods.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "c1", "volume": "25", "lastpage": "c16", "date_publication": "March 2010", "inspec": "11340791", "date": "March 2010", "date_current_version": "Thu May 13 00:00:00 EDT 2010", "issue": "3", "pages": "c1 - c16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["David K.
