A pilot flying these signals precisely will end up over the hard surface runway with the ILS receiving antenna, wherever it is mounted on the aircraft, being about 20 ft above the touchdown point. The safety record and evolution of the ILS are examined, and a pilot's view of ILS (that of the author, an engineer who has worked with ILS since 1957 and a pilot who has used ILS safely for over 30 years) is given. System availability is discussed, and comments concerning future use are offered", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "12", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "15", "date_publication": "May 1990", "inspec": "3713499", "date": "May 1990", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "12 - 15", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
