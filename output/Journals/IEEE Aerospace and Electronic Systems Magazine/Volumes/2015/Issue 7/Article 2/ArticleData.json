Nowadays, noncooperative target recognition (NCTR) is considered an important subject. NCTR means technologies provide high-resolution target signatures and use them to make some decisions about the type of target that has been detected. Clearly, this function is performed with no cooperation from the target concerned, and it may even not be aware that its signature is being measured for recognition purposes [1]. Jet engine modulation (JEM) [2]-[4] generated by the engine rotation in an aircraft has been used for radar-based NCTR purposes, along with high-resolution range profile and inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) [5]-[7]. Recognition by JEM uses micro-Doppler features induced by a rotating jet engine compressor. The micro-Doppler is characterized by a time-dependent Doppler shift that is different from that caused by the target bulk motion.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "30", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "July 2015", "inspec": "15415792", "date": "July 2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Sep 01 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "7", "pages": "18 - 29", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Woo Yong Yang", "Ji Hoon Park", "Jun Woo Bae", "Noh Hoon Myung", "Chan Hong Kim"], "keywords": ["Doppler radar", "Doppler shift", "airborne radar", "blades", "jet engines", "object recognition", "radar detection", "synthetic aperture radar", "Doppler shift", "JEM", "airborne target", "aircraft target detection", "high-resolution target signature", "inverse synthetic aperture radar", "jet engine blade number estimation", "jet engine modulation", "micro-Doppler features", "noncooperative target recognition", "radar target signature", "radar-based NCTR", "rotating jet engine compressor", "target bulk motion", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Estimation", "Harmonic analysis", "Jet engines", "Radar tracking", "Target tracking", ""], "arnumber": "7235040"}
