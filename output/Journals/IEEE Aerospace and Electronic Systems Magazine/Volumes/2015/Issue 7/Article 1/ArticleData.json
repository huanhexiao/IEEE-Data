Researchers from European, American, and Japanese institutions submitted a white paper on the scientific case for a mission to Neptune and Triton. The document included an example mission concept and aimed to demonstrate that the proposed science theme can be addressed with technology that is expected to become available within the L2 and L3 time frames (2028 and 2034). We present here the trajectory design for the mission concept and a high-level discussion on its feasibility, which was included in the white paper. We also present details on the example Triton tour, a new search for interplanetary transfers, and a preliminary analysis of the gravity losses at Neptune orbit insertion (NOI), which suggests the use of a large chemical propulsion system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "6", "volume": "30", "lastpage": "17", "date_publication": "July 2015", "inspec": "15415790", "date": "July 2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Sep 01 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "7", "pages": "6 - 17", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Stefano Campagnola", "Arnaud Boutonnet", "Waldemar Martens", "Adam Masters"], "keywords": ["Neptune", "planetary satellites", "space vehicles", "AD 2013", "American institution", "European Space Agency", "European institution", "Japanese institution", "L-class missions", "L2 time frame", "L3 time frame", "Neptune exploration", "Neptune orbit insertion", "Triton exploration", "chemical propulsion system", "flagship missions", "interplanetary transfers", "mission concept", "mission design", "scientific community", "trajectory design", "Design methodology", "Interplanetary", "Mars", "Payloads", "Planets", "Propulsion", "Space research", "Space vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "7235038"}
