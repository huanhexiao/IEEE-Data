Data analysis explores height accuracy of differential barometric altimetry compared with the absolute barometric altimetry approach. In the former case, two equivalent and custom-made altimeters are synchronized for the simultaneous acquisition of atmospheric pressure with 300 ms sampling interval. In the latter case, height is determined using the same pressure data obtained from the rover-in the system-altimeter. As regards differential barometric altimetry, the authors address a simple setup in order to explore sensors' output deviation under the same conditions (i.e., pressure, temperature, etc.), as well as evaluate the subsequent effect on height measurement error. The experimental setup exploits the wireless feature of the proposed system for the acquisition of pressure measurements within an airtight enclosure with vacuum pump for changing the pressure threshold.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "20", "volume": "30", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "November 2015", "inspec": "15697259", "date": "November 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Jan 08 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "11", "pages": "20 - 28", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Dimosthenis E.
