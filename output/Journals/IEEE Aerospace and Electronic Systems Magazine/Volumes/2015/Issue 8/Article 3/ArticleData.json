As high accuracy and high reliability devices, star sensors play an important role in attitude determination for satellites. Based on the star images sampled by star sensors, the locations of the star image in the star sensor coordinate system can be identified with identification algorithms. With the help of the coordinates of the star images in the field of view (FOV), a three-axis attitude of the star sensor in the inertial coordinate can be calculated and then the attitude of the satellites can be calculated through coordinate transforming. However, the star pattern recognition algorithm is the most important for attitude determination of star sensors. The probability of success and the time to identify stars of the star pattern recognition algorithm are the key factors for star sensors.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "24", "volume": "30", "lastpage": "31", "date_publication": "Aug. 2015", "inspec": "15488943", "date": "Aug. 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 01 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "8", "pages": "24 - 31", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Baohua Li", "Qi Sun", "Tongshuang Zhang"], "keywords": ["attitude measurement", "image sampling", "inertial navigation", "space vehicle navigation", "star trackers", "coordinate transformation", "double-FOV star sensor", "field of view", "identification algorithm", "inertial coordinate", "reliable attitude determination system", "spacecraft", "star image sampling", "star pattern recognition algorithm", "star sensor coordinate system", "Image sensors", "Pattern recognition", "Position measurement", "Satellites", "Sensor systems", "Space vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "7286961"}
