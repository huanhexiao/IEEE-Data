Then it describes the multitarget tracking data fusion (MTTDF) network architecture developed at Science and Technology Organization (STO) Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE) and discusses its capabilities in two real study cases: the first in the Ligurian Sea, Mediterranean [11]-[13], and a second in the German Bight, North Sea [14], [15]. In both cases, the main task of the HFSW radars is to estimate sea surface currents. In the second study case, the data recorded by the single stations are sent directly to the Centre's Data Base (DB) and then processed in real-time. The historical information about ship traffic can be exploited not only for assessing system performance, but also in the field of knowledge-based (KB) tracking, for improving system capabilities. In this sense, simulation results are presented and discussed. Finally, a tool developed at STO CMRE, the so-called maritime situational awareness (MSA) viewer, allows displaying from the operator's point of view the maritime picture of the surveyed area.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "30", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "December 2015", "inspec": "15697037", "date": "December 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 14 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "12", "pages": "4 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Paolo Braca", "Salvatore Maresca", "Raffaele Grasso", "Karna Bryan", "Jochen Horstmann"], "keywords": ["marine radar", "search radar", "sensor fusion", "target tracking", "Wellen radar systems", "high-frequency surface-wave radar systems", "maritime situational awareness viewer", "maritime surveillance", "multiple over-the-horizon HFSW radars", "multitarget tracking data fusion system", "sea surface currents", "Chirp modulation", "Marine vehicles", "Radar measurements", "Sea measurements", "Sea surface", "Surface waves", "Surveillance", ""], "arnumber": "7381284"}
