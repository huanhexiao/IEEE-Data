The features of MEMSs are their light weight and small size; hence, the MEMSs have found significant attention in low-cost navigation and control systems. A common disadvantage of these sensors is the significant errors that accompany the corresponding measurements. The accuracy obtained using MEMSs depends on a number of factors, such as scale factor, bias, and random noise corrections. However, these low-cost sensors suffer from large noise and errors, making calibration and error identification of critical importance.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "20", "volume": "30", "lastpage": "33", "date_publication": "December 2015", "inspec": "15697038", "date": "December 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 14 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "12", "pages": "20 - 33", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Masoud Mirzaei Teshnizi", "Abolfazl Shirazi"], "keywords": ["attitude measurement", "calibration", "magnetometers", "microsensors", "navigation", "nonlinear filters", "sun sensors", "MEMS magnetometer", "attitude determination", "calibration", "control system", "error identification", "microelectromechanical sensor", "navigation", "nonlinear attitude estimation algorithm", "nonlinear filter", "random noise correction", "scale factor", "sensor identification", "sun sensor", "Electromechanical devices", "Magnetic field measurement", "Magnetometers", "Microelectoromechanical sensors", "Nonlinear attitude estimation", "Quaternions", "Satellites", "Sensors", ""], "arnumber": "7381287"}
