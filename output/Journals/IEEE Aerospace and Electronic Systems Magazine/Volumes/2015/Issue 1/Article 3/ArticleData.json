So the aircraft engine control system consists of a family of continuous-time subsystems and switches from one to another depending on various environmental factors (see Figure 1). When the system switches from one subcontrol loop to another, the stability of the system is the basic performance that must be considered. The traditional control method is to switch slowly to avoid the dangers. Therefore, there is much space to improve the dynamic performance of the control system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "32", "volume": "30", "lastpage": "42", "date_publication": "Jan. 2015", "inspec": "14930633", "date": "Jan. 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 13 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "32 - 42", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Xiaofeng Liu", "Jing Shi", "Ye Yuan", "Siqi An"], "keywords": ["aerospace engines", "aircraft control", "continuous time systems", "control system synthesis", "linear systems", "nonlinear control systems", "aircraft engine control system", "continuous-time subsystem", "controller design", "environmental factors", "linear control system", "multiobjective control system", "nonlinear control system", "Aerospace control", "Aircraft propulsion", "Control systems", "Controllers", "Design methodology", "Environmental factors", "Nonlinear control systems", "Switching systems", "Temperature control", "Uncertainty", ""], "arnumber": "7041325"}
