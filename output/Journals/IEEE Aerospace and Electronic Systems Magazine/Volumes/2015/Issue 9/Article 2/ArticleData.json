The IMA concept, which replaces numerous separate processors and line replaceable units (LRUs) with fewer, more centralized processing units, has led to significant weight reduction and maintenance savings in both military and commercial airborne platforms. The IMA concept for this definition originated in the United States with the F-22 Joint Integrated Avionics Working Group (JIAWG) 30 years ago and then migrated to business jets and commercial transports in the late 1990s. In the last 10 years, the mainstream IMA definition has incorporated time and space partitioned software environments based on the ARINC 653 standard. During this period, software complexity has exploded. The ARINC 653 extended IMA definition has enabled the development of common software infrastructure to enhance complex systems management and enable greater software reuse. In open literature, civil aviation has cornerstone IMA extended examples in the Airbus 380 and Boeing 787 Dream-liner platforms. This article provides a summary of IMA history, presents these new IMA challenges going forward, and summarizes research focus exploring advanced IMA solutions.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "12", "volume": "30", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "Sept. 2015", "inspec": "15583832", "date": "Sept. 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 05 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "9", "pages": "12 - 23", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Thomas Gaska", "Chris Watkin", "Yu Chen"], "keywords": ["aerospace computing", "avionics", "software metrics", "ARINC 653 extended IMA definition", "ARINC 653 standard", "Airbus 380", "Boeing 787 Dream-liner platforms", "F-22 joint integrated avionics working group", "JIAWG", "LRUs", "business jets", "centralized processing units", "civil aviation", "commercial airborne platforms", "common software infrastructure development", "complex systems management", "integrated modular avionics", "line replaceable units", "maintenance savings", "military airborne platforms", "software complexity", "software levels", "space partitioned software environments", "time partitioned software environments", "weight reduction", "Aerospace electronics", "Aerospace engineering", "Computer architecture", "Military aircraft", "Modular construction", "Software development", ""], "arnumber": "7321122"}
