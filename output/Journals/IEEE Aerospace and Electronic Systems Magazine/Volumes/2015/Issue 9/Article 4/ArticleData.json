Making use of the technology advances of the Second World War, a much improved VOR-based navigation infrastructure with RADAR surveillance was implemented in the second half of the 20th century. Increased air traffic and heightened concerns for safety and environmental issues fostered the need for improved and more flexible navigation. Space-based navigation was the technological gift that provided the ability to achieve improved navigation performance. Space-based navigation is not tied to a ground network of navigation aids and airways gave way to tailored routes that minimized fuel consumption, improved comfort and safety, and generally increased the efficiency of air travel. PBN/RNP is a key element in the FAA's NextGen and it is pretty certain the FAA will make good on its promise in the Roadmap to install the infrastructure and mandate RNAV/RNP in most airspace. It was suggested that the birth date of avionics was 1917. It is rather fitting that the FAA's NextGen Implementation Plan, 2014 [15] shows the program to be mostly completed by 2017, the centennial of avionics.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "36", "volume": "30", "lastpage": "45", "date_publication": "Sept. 2015", "inspec": "15583831", "date": "Sept. 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 05 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "9", "pages": "36 - 45", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Albert Helfrick"], "keywords": ["aircraft navigation", "avionics", "radionavigation", "FAA NextGen", "PBN-RNP", "air traffic", "aviation electronics", "avionics", "crude communications apparatus", "fuel consumption", "improved VOR-based navigation infrastructure", "nationwide radio-based navigation system", "performance-based navigation", "radar surveillance", "space-based navigation", "Aerospace electronics", "Aircraft navigation", "History", "Military aircraft", "Radio navigation", "Surveillance", ""], "arnumber": "7321125"}
