However, they are still underexploited in many applications. The main driver of this situation is that devices implementing such architectures are too advanced and powerful for the system's needs. The situation in avionics is even worst, because there are just few certifable RCA devices for aerospace. In addition, the fexible nature of RCAs incurs high costs and risks along the system development life cycle (certifcation processes). This article reviews existing methodologies and technologies for RCAs with a strong emphasis on computing granularity and agile management of resources.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "46", "volume": "30", "lastpage": "53", "date_publication": "Sept. 2015", "inspec": "15573962", "date": "Sept. 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 05 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "9", "pages": "46 - 53", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Carlos Insaurralde"], "keywords": ["aerospace computing", "avionics", "reconfigurable architectures", "software prototyping", "RCA", "aerospace", "agile management", "certification process", "computing granularity", "high-integrity avionics system", "reconfigurable computer architecture", "system development life cycle", "Aerodynamics", "Aerospace electronics", "Computer architecture", "Field programmable gate arrays", "Power demand", "Random access memory", ""], "arnumber": "7321126"}
