Specifically, joint adaptive processing in the spatial and temporal domains called space-time adaptive processing (STAP) creates an ability to suppress interference signals, while simultaneously preserving gain on the desired signal. For STAP implementation, the interference statistics, in particular, the covariance matrix of the disturbance or interference, must be estimated from target-free training data. Therefore, the disturbance covariance estimation plays a pivotal role in radar target detection for radar STAP.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "24", "volume": "30", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "Feb. 2015", "inspec": "15000635", "date": "Feb. 2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Mar 18 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "2", "pages": "24 - 25", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Bosung Kang"], "keywords": ["covariance matrices", "radar detection", "space-time adaptive processing", "disturbance covariance estimation", "interference signals", "joint adaptive processing", "multiple antenna elements", "multiple pulses", "radar STAP", "radar target detection", "space-time adaptive processing", "structured covariance matrices", "Aircraft navigation", "Multiple antennas", "Radar antennas", "Radar detection", "Signal resolution", "Spatial resolution", "Target tracking", ""], "arnumber": "7063663"}
