Although UAV missions can often be operated autonomously under pilot supervision via telemetry, the launch and recovery phases often require piloting by using manual remote control (RC) and the pilot's visual feedback. Availability of reliable automatic recovery functionality with predictable performance is an important step towards increased autonomy that could potentially lead to reduced operating costs (no need for a skilled RC pilot) and improved safety records and thereby enable increased use of UAVs.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "30", "lastpage": "27", "date_publication": "May 2015", "inspec": "15200747", "date": "May 2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 09 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "5", "pages": "18 - 27", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Robert Skulstad", "Christoffer Syversen", "Mariann Merz", "Nadezda Sokolova", "Thor Fossen", "Tor Johansen"], "keywords": ["aerospace control", "autonomous aerial vehicles", "mobile robots", "satellite navigation", "telerobotics", "RC", "autonomous net recovery", "autonomously under pilot supervision", "fixed wing UAV", "geographically constrained sites", "launch phases", "manual remote control", "operationally constrained sites", "pilot visual feedback", "recovery phases", "reliable automatic recovery functionality", "single frequency carrier phase differential GNSS", "telemetry", "Base stations", "Global Positioning System", "Marine vehciles", "Receivers", "Remotely operated vehicles", "Safety", "Satellites", "Software development", "Telemetry", "Unmanned aerial vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "7119821"}
