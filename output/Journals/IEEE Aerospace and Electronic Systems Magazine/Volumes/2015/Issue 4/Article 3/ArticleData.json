The plasma consists of heterogeneous structures, which are susceptible to perturbation caused by solar winds. Radio waves passing through the ionosphere experience scintillation due to irregularities in the plasma. This is a problem for satellite-based systems used for communication and navigation because the signals received by ground-based terminals experience reduced signal quality. This effect is greater around the Equator and near the polar cusps. During periods with high solar activity it can cause satellite communication outage. To understand radio wave disturbance in the ionosphere and develop more accurate space weather models, one must measure and quantify the plasma structures and perturbation by using in-situ instruments.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "24", "volume": "30", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "April 2015", "inspec": "15111702", "date": "April 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri May 08 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "24 - 28", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Johan Ludvig Tresvig", "Torfnn Lindem"], "keywords": ["geophysical signal processing", "ionospheric disturbances", "ionospheric electromagnetic wave propagation", "ionospheric measuring apparatus", "radiowave propagation", "satellite communication", "solar activity", "solar wind", "Earth magnetic field", "Equator", "ground-based terminals", "heterogeneous structures", "in-situ instruments", "ionosphere measurements", "miniaturized subpayload system", "perturbation", "plasma irregularities", "polar cusps", "radio wave disturbance", "satellite communication outage", "satellite-based system communication", "satellite-based system navigation", "scintillation", "signal quality", "solar activity", "solar winds", "space weather models", "Atmospheric measurements", "Bandwidth", "Bit error rate", "Electromagnetic fields", "Ionosphere", "Payloads", "Plasmas", "Receivers", "Rockets", "Telemetry", ""], "arnumber": "7104304"}
