Bathymetry reconstruction of underwater environments is of great importance for applications ranging from infrastructure inspection to intrusion detection. Side-scan images, that is, two-dimensional (2-D) images of the backscattered signal amplitude are affected by the layover phenomenon, i.e., superposition of echoes. This phenomenon appears in the presence of tall objects, whenever the pulse emitted by the sonar ensonifies the top of the object before the bottom. In such, the area around the object is not entirely observable and a full 3-D bathymetry reconstruction is necessary. For sidelooking sonar arrays, bathymetry is obtained by triangulating the scatterers corresponding to each range bin, or equivalently, estimating the direction of arrival (DOA) of backscattered echoes.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "34", "volume": "30", "lastpage": "36", "date_publication": "June 2015", "inspec": "15292345", "date": "June 2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Jul 15 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "34 - 36", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Augustin-Alexandru Saucan"], "keywords": ["bathymetry", "direction-of-arrival estimation", "image reconstruction", "sonar", "adaptive sonar-array processing", "direction of arrival", "echo DOA tracking", "intrusion detection", "side-scan images", "sonar bathymetry", "three-dimensional depth map reconstruction", "two-dimensional images", "underwater environments", "Array signal processing", "Direction-of-arrival estimation", "Image reconstruction", "Radar tracking", "Sonar array processing", "Target tracking", ""], "arnumber": "7158952"}
