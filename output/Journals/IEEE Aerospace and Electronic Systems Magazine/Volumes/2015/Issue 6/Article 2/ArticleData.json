To this end, an approach and demonstration results to accommodate a future requirement to deliver FACE UoPs to the aircraft integrators has been presented. The CAS team has determined that future efforts will incorporate the architectural elements and development methodologies presented in this paper to expedite the deployment of GPWS/TAWS/ OAS/MCAS capability tailored to the performance of a specific aircraft. Providing FACE conformant UoPs should expedite the deployment and future sustainment of these capabilities to platforms in dire need of protection.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "16", "volume": "30", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "June 2015", "inspec": "15292344", "date": "June 2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Jul 15 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "16 - 23", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Scott Brabson", "Thomas Anderson"], "keywords": ["aircraft control", "collision avoidance", "CAS", "FACE UoPs", "GPWS-TAWS-OAS-MCAS", "US Navy collision avoidance systems", "aircraft integrators", "auto-recovery CAS", "future airborne capability environment", "ground proximity warning system", "mid-air collision avoidance system", "obstacle avoidance system", "terrain awareness warning system", "Aerospace electronics", "Collision avoidance", "Computer architecture", "Military aircraft", "Software algorithms", "Software development", "Trajectory", "US Department of Defense", ""], "arnumber": "7158949"}
