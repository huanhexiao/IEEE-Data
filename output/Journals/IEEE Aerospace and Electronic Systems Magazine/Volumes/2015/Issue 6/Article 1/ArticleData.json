The data set is useful for those doing research on projection, tracking, georegistration, and other image-related activities. The data set includes raw images, pose data, and projected images. For users that would like to project the data, a camera model and calibration are provided here. The camera model and calibration developed here provide a significant improvement over the projected images included with the data.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "30", "lastpage": "15", "date_publication": "June 2015", "inspec": "15302130", "date": "June 2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Jul 15 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "4 - 15", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Curtis Cohenour", "Frank van Graas", "Rebecca Price", "Todd Rovito"], "keywords": ["calibration", "cameras", "image motion analysis", "image registration", "target tracking", "AFRL", "Air Force Research Laboratory", "WAMI data set", "WPAFB 2009", "Wright Patterson air force base 2009", "calibration", "camera model", "georegistration", "image projection", "image-related activity", "wide-area motion imagery data set", "Aircraft", "Calibration", "Cameras", "Cascading style sheets", "Data models", "Georegistration", "Image capture", "Military aircraft", "US Department of Defense", ""], "arnumber": "7158947"}
