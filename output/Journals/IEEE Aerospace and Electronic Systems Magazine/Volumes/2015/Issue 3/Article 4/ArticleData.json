The formation fight can increase redundancy backup, decentralize the cost, and provide a multi-platform for the deep space exploration [17]. For the deep space explorer formation fight, both absolute and relative navigation accuracies are crucial, especially the relative one. Orbit determination of a spacecraft is primarily performed at a ground station [4]. Unfortunately, subject to the long distance between the explorer and the earth, traditional ground station-based navigation methods cannot provide high-accuracy and real-time navigation information. Consequently, the autonomous navigation systems [12], [13], which observe the celestial bodies to obtain the navigation information, are highly attractive.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "30", "volume": "30", "lastpage": "39", "date_publication": "March 2015", "inspec": "15036116", "date": "March 2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 07 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "30 - 39", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
