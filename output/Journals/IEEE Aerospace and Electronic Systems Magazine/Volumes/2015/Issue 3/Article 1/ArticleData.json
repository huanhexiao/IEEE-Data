Tetraethyllead is always added in aviation gasoline to increase octane and prevent the knock characteristic of gasoline engines, however, the discharge of leaded fuels pollutes the environment seriously, and aviation gasoline is scarce and expensive [1], [2]. Motor vehicle gasoline has been adopted by aviation gasoline engines with the help of technological improvement, but this has a potential safety hazard in high altitude fight, which can also be posed by the very low flash point of motor vehicle gasoline and an easily frozen inlet pipe at high altitude. Employing kerosene or diesel oil as the fuel for piston aviation engines has great significance for military and general aviation; therefore developing piston aviation diesel engines has aroused discussions between countries in recent years [3].", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "30", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "March 2015", "inspec": "15036118", "date": "March 2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 07 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "4 - 10", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Zhongjian Pan", "Qinghua He", "Xiangjian Zhang", "Daqing Zhang"], "keywords": ["aerospace engines", "aircraft", "internal combustion engines", "numerical analysis", "petroleum", "pipes", "pistons", "2-stroke diesel engine", "aviation gasoline engines", "diesel oil", "frozen inlet pipe", "high altitude flight", "kerosene", "knock characteristic", "light aircraft", "motor vehicle gasoline", "numerical simulation", "octane", "piston aviation engines", "safety hazard", "tetraethyllead", "trainer aircraft", "unmanned aerial vehicle", "Aircraft navigation", "Aircraft propulsion", "Diesel engines", "Fuels", "Gasoline", "Numerical simulation", "Pistons", "Unmanned aerial vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "7081632"}
