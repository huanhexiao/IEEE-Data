The equivalent circuit approach of MTM was developed by Caloz and Itoh [2] and Sanada et al. [3], and this approach has led to the concept of composite right- and left-handed (CRLH) materials. This concept fully takes into account the parasitic right-handed (RH) effects, which is unavoidable in a practical application. The zeroth-order resonator (ZOR) has the mode number zero, and its resonator length is invariant of its wavelength. Sanada et al. [3] first proposed MTM-ZOR and realized it in microstrip configuration. Using the MTM-ZOR technique, several researchers [4]-[8] have designed band pass filters (BPFs) in different frequency bands.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "22", "volume": "30", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "March 2015", "inspec": "15036117", "date": "March 2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 07 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "22 - 29", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Sougata Chatterjee", "Anil Raut", "Suresh Kumar"], "keywords": ["UHF filters", "UHF radio propagation", "band-pass filters", "electromagnetic metamaterials", "equivalent circuits", "microstrip filters", "microstrip resonators", "radioastronomical techniques", "radiotelescopes", "MTM-ZOR technique", "artificial composite material", "band pass filter bank design", "composite right-and left-handed materials", "electromagnetic properties", "equivalent circuit approach", "frequency 250 MHz to 500 MHz", "frequency bands", "metamaterial ZOR techniques", "microstrip configuration", "mode number", "parasitic right-handed effects", "radio astronomy application", "resonator length", "zeroth-order resonator", "Band-pass filters", "Composite materials", "Electromagnetic measurements", "Equivalent circuits", "Filtering theory", "Frequency bands", "Metamaterials", "Microstrip", ""], "arnumber": "7081636"}
