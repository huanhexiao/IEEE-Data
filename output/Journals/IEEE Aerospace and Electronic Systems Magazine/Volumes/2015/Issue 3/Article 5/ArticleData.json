To realize their full potential in performance, they require a \u201cgood\u201d code set. Each radar station in a MIMO radar or an ONRS transmits its own good code, belonging to the set of good codes. On reception, the radar stations process their signal returns as well as signal returns from other radar stations and the resulting data is then fed into a fusion processor. The fusion processor uses the data from each of the radar stations in the MIMO radar/ONRS to form an elaborate 3D image of the area of interest.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "40", "volume": "30", "lastpage": "42", "date_publication": "March 2015", "inspec": "15036115", "date": "March 2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 07 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "40 - 42", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Farhan A.
