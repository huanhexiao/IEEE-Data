Obtaining rough estimates of dynamic behavior in early stages of design and development reduces the costs and prevents failure in the development process. One of the important factors in designing a successful aerial vehicle is ensuring the quality of its dynamic responses. Generally, experimental and theoretical models are used to predict dynamic characteristics of aerial vehicles. In some cases, like unconventional configurations or severe flight conditions, these models are inaccurate and unsatisfactory. Nonlinear effects like coupling between fuselage and rotor dynamics and cross-coupling between axes lead to difficulties in derivation of such models, especially for unconventional robotic air vehicles. Due to the expanded use of these vehicles in recent years, many innovative aerial concepts are introduced.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "30", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "October 2015", "inspec": "15696166", "date": "October 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 07 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "10", "pages": "4 - 12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Afshin Banazadeh", "Mahan Behroo"], "keywords": ["aerospace testing", "mathematical analysis", "space vehicles", "aerial vehicle", "coanda air vehicle", "dynamic behavior estimation", "dynamic response", "fuselage", "mathematical model", "nonlinear effect", "robotic air vehicle", "rotor dynamics", "Aerodynamics", "Atmospheric modeling", "Batteries", "Mathematical model", "Propellers", "System identification", "Vehicle dynamics", ""], "arnumber": "7374024"}
