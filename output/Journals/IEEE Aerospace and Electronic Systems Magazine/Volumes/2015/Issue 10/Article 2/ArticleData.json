With the extensive application and popularization of GPS, it makes remarkable contributions to scientific applications and engineering services. Currently, two emerging constellations (BDS, Galileo) as well as the recovery of GLONASS, the multiconstellation GNSS is undergoing dramatic development with better performance. Once the four systems are fully deployed, about 120 satellites will be available for GNSS users [1]. If all the visible satellites are used for position resolving, it will burden the receiver processor significantly. Meanwhile, there may be larger pseudorange measurement errors when the satellites have low elevation for the transmission of ionospheric and tropospheric delay. In addition, we cannot neglect simultaneous multiple outliers in multiconstellation GNSS compared with conventional RAIM. With respect to the weighted matrix factor in WLS, i.e., the uncertainty of the pseudorange measurements, estimation error is often used for weighted matrix estimation, without concerning real-time transmission error and signal quality, which somewhat enlarges the positioning accuracy. Thus, there is a need to deal with the above concerns.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "30", "lastpage": "27", "date_publication": "October 2015", "inspec": "15696165", "date": "October 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 07 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "10", "pages": "14 - 27", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Fanchen Meng", "Shan Wang", "Bocheng Zhu"], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "artificial satellites", "estimation theory", "matrix algebra", "measurement errors", "measurement uncertainty", "reliability", "BDS", "GDOP", "GLONASS", "GNSS reliability", "Galileo", "Global Navigation Satellite System", "RAIM", "WLS algorithm", "fast satellite selection algorithm", "geometric dilution of precision", "ionospheric delay transmission", "multiconstellation", "positioning accuracy enhancement", "pseudorange measurement errors", "pseudorange measurement uncertainty", "receiver autonomous integrity monitoring", "reliability", "satellite geometry distribution", "tropospheric delay transmission", "weighted least square algorithm", "weighted matrix estimation", "weighted matrix factor estimation", "Computational complexity", "Global Positioning System", "Global navigation satellite system", "Performance evaluation", "Position measurement", "Receivers", "Satellites", ""], "arnumber": "7374026"}
