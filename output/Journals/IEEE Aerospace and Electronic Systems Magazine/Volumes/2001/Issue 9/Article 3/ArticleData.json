We typically create virtual worlds that allow the user to interact with 3D real-time graphics. We refer to the virtual worlds enabling this interaction as synthetic environments. A synthetic environment produces sufficient sensory cues to make users believe they are in a different geographic location with a different velocity and orientation than they have in the real world. Classical flight simulators are a subset of synthetic environments. Although they do not usually use stereoscopic displays, they do use large FOV visual systems, digital audio, force feedback via the flight controls, and force feedback on the simulator as a whole via a motion base. We believe the addition of stereoscopic 3D graphics will be particularly valuable in hovering, formation flying, and landing. VRAC uses two surround screen environments, the C2 and the C6. The C2 came on line in 1995. It is a room with four projected surfaces, three walls and the floor. The C6, which came on line in June 2000, is a cube-shaped room, the first of its kind in the US, with 3D graphics projected on all four walls, the floor, and the ceiling. The C2 and C6 are linked by a dedicated fiber network. This will enable collaboration between geographically separated virtual worlds. Many researchers believe that collaboration between geographically separate synthetic environments is the key to future breakthroughs in the use of SE technology. The C2/C6 combination will be an ideal testbed to support this kind of collaboration. In addition, the C2 and C6 are connected to a 250-person auditorium that has dual screens capable of simultaneously displaying real-time images from two sources. Our vision is simultaneous display of real-time graphics from the C2 and the C6 in the auditorium, enabling up to 250 people to study and, perhaps, participate in the real-time interactions. As quality of service, bandwidth, and latency challenges are met by emerging technology, we also look forward to interconnecting the C2, the C6, and the auditorium with off campus simulators", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "Sep 2001", "inspec": "7064542", "date": "Sep 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "19 - 23", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
