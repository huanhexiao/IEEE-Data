Combining excellent performance with affordability, they have become the product of choice for portable computers and cellular phones. Building on the same energy and life cycle attributes, which marked their consumer market success, but adding new high power storage capability, lithium ion technology is now poised to play a similar role in the transportation, military, and space sectors. With major program in various aspects of electric and hybrid electric vehicles, Saft has developed a family of battery products that address the power and energy storage where lightweight, long life, and excellent energy or power storage capabilities are needed. Significant progress in the packaging and control of high power, yet compact, batteries has been accomplished for a variety of vehicle applications. This paper discusses the charger and balancing strategies of one of this family of products", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "Sep 2001", "inspec": "7064541", "date": "Sep 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "15 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["T.
