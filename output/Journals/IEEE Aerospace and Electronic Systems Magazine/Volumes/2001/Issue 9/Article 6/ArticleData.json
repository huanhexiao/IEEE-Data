Recently, work has focused on the testing of different chemistries at variable temperatures and designing and fabricating 100-Ah cylindrical cells. For the aircraft application the largest concern is irreversible capacity loss at elevated temperatures (70\u00b0C). In contrast, for the aerospace application shelf-life and cycle life are critical. EPEP has found that the major contributor to the loss in low temperature performance due to high temperature testing, was the positive electrode. EPEP discuss recent results of variable temperature cycling and 100-Ah cell performance", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "24", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "Sep 2001", "inspec": "7064543", "date": "Sep 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "24 - 28", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["G.
