By using GPS technology, ERP systems will be extremely efficient and cost-effective. This paper describes the next generation of ERP in Singapore and proposes a GPS based multisensor positioning system for ERP vehicles. Multisensor fusion algorithms are presented for the integration system. The integrated positioning system (IPS) developed in this paper makes it possible to realize GPS based ERP with a simple composition and low cost", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "10", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "14", "date_publication": "Sep 2001", "inspec": "7064540", "date": "Sep 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "10 - 14", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["X.
