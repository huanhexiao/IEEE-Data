A protracted test development time for a commercial product can make or break its success. It can impact time-to-market goals for a product, which in turn, can result in a loss of market share. Though the DoD world has different objectives, they, too, are concerned with long test development times which can increase costs and jeopardize a weapon system's mission readiness. The case study for this paper is a test system developed by BAE Systems in less than four months to meet a commercial customer's stringent schedule requirements. The factors that contributed to the success of this project are examined, as is their relevance to the DoD world. The desire is to apply relevant lessons learned from the commercial industry to DoD programs, yielding a decrease in TPS development time", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "7", "date_publication": "Jul 2001", "inspec": "6994086", "date": "Jul 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "4 - 7", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
