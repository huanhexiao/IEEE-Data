Often called intrusion location capability, this capability also presents inherent features such as more accuracy in camera pre-set positioning and temporary disabling of sub-zone and individual sensitivity level per sub-zone. However even though market trend demands them, such features must have minimum impact to overall system cost. How the synergistic radar technology can be modified to offer intruder location capability to a sub-zone area as precise as 10% of the total zone length is presented. For a typical zone length of 100 meters, the zone is sub-divided into up to ten equally spaced sub-zones of 10 meters each, giving an intrusion crossing point resolution of 10 meters. Synergistic radar technology can be applied to buried, surface, wall and roof applications. This intrusion location capability also applies to each of these applications", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "Jul 2001", "inspec": "6994090", "date": "Jul 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "21 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
