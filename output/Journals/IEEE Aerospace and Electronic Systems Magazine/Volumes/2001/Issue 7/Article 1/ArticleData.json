The training of these individuals is critical to their performance on the job. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is very interested in enhancing screener training and further improving their readiness for the job. The FAA's aviation security human factors program has developed and assisted in the development of a number of tests and training tools to aid in the selection and training of screeners. Now the program is concentrating on the development of an on-the-job training mastery test to ensure that screener candidates have acquired all of the checkpoint operations skills and abilities needed to be a successful checkpoint screener", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "20", "date_publication": "Jul 2001", "inspec": "6994089", "date": "Jul 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "18 - 20", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["S.
