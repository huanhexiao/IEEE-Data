Currently, E-Field(R) systems are widely deployed in nuclear, correctional, and industrial sites to provide perimeter security. These systems are effective in rejecting the majority of noise and environmental stimuli through combined fixed attribute threshold comparison techniques. However, some environmental stimuli closely mimic target stimuli, so improved discrimination techniques have been sought. We describe the results of current studies and investigations of electrostatic sensor system response to targets and to various environmental changes. Fundamental principles in the character of sensor response to these varied stimuli are discussed. Techniques and methods that may be used to exploit the difference between intruder and environmental responses, while using cost-effective discrimination methods, are described. We show how the new Intelli-FIELD system was created, using currently available technologies, to provide both excellent detection properties, and an extremely low nuisance alarm rate, while, at the same time, greatly simplifying installation, calibration, and maintenance. The details of the new system hardware components and test results from initial field installations are described. A comparison of field performance with the previous E-Field product is provided to indicate the advantages of this new sensor technology", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "Jul 2001", "inspec": "6994091", "date": "Jul 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "25 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
