Initiatives such as SCPI and VXIplug&play have simplified remote instrument programming with standardized command messages and high-level utility functions. The latest initiative is the Interchangeable Virtual Instrument (IVI) Foundation. IVI defines standards for instrument drivers that offer benefits to provide higher performance. These benefits include instrument interchangeability, instrument simulation, and instrument state-caching. Because instrument drivers are an integral part of a modern test system, IVI promises to provide developers with the tools to increase their system performance significantly. This paper reviews the technical aspects of the IVI specification and the TVI architecture and describes how IVI can help the test system developer improve performance and lower long-term software maintenance costs", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "8", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "11", "date_publication": "Jul 2001", "inspec": "6994087", "date": "Jul 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "8 - 11", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
