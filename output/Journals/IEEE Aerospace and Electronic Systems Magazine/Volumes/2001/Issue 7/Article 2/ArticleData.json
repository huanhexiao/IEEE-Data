This paper presents an approach for evaluating tracking/fusion algorithms that consider the difficulty of the problem. Evaluation is performed by characterizing the performance of the basic functions of prediction and association. The problem complexity is summarized by means of context metrics. Two context metrics for characterizing prediction and association difficulty are normalized target mobility and normalized target density. These metrics should be presented along with the performance metrics. The context metrics also support more efficient generation of input data for performance evaluation. Simple tests for evaluating basic tracking algorithm functions are presented", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "12", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "17", "date_publication": "Jul 2001", "inspec": "6994088", "date": "Jul 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "12 - 17", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Chee-Yee Chong"], "keywords": ["computational complexity", "equivalence classes", "prediction theory", "sensor fusion", "state estimation", "target tracking", "association difficulty", "context metrics", "equivalence classes", "input data generation", "multiple target tracking", "normalized target density", "normalized target mobility", "performance evaluation", "prediction difficulty", "problem complexity", "state estimates", "tracking/fusion algorithm", "Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Fusion power generation", "Measurement", "Performance evaluation", "Root mean square", "Sensor phenomena and characterization", "State estimation", "Target tracking", "Testing", ""], "arnumber": "935460"}
