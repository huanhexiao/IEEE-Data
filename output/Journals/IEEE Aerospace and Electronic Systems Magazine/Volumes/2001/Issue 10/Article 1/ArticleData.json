The challenge has always been how to pack effective electronic systems into the space available. Higher levels of electronic integration can give a competitive advantage; for example, by providing extra channels in a communications satellite thereby increasing revenue to the operator. Today's deep sub-micron manufacturing processes for integrated electronics offer an opportunity for a step change for electronic functionality that can be packaged in a given space. This technology makes possible, for the first time, a true system-on-chip approach to electronic systems, which is already being exploited by the commercial sector in products such as the mobile telephone", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "36", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "41", "date_publication": "Oct 2001", "inspec": "7094979", "date": "Oct 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "36 - 41", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
