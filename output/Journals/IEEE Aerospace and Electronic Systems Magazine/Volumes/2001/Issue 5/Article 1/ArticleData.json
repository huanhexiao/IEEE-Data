Why move to IEEE 1394, what are the possible risks with doing so, what are some of the myths associated with IEEE 1394 and a practical example of an automatic test application will all be presented with the prime emphasis on giving the latest information that will help you get IEEE 1394 integrated into your automatic test system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "7", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "May 2001", "inspec": "6952950", "date": "May 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "7 - 10", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
