Based on very specific and restrictive operational requirements coupled with developments in digital radio technology and the Associated Public Communications Officers (APCO) Project 25 digital radio standards, it was determined that digital radio communications would best meet CSC's needs. The CSC national radio replacement program was completed in March 2000. Switching to a digital radio communications system gave CSC an opportunity to consider changing the existing radio system from a number of conventional, single-site systems to a trunking system. Areas to be considered when determining the architecture for a radio communication network, whether radio trunking systems or conventional radio systems should be used, are presented, In addition, the paper will also outline the requirements and measures taken to keep the radio communication network active and operational while the equipment was converted from an analog technology to a digital one", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "6", "date_publication": "May 2001", "inspec": "6952949", "date": "May 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "3 - 6", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
