Various system redundancies are designed in the X-33 to enhance the probability of successfully completing its mission in the event of faults and failures during flight. One such redundant system is the Vehicle and Mission Computer that controls the X-33 ea, and manages the avionics subsystems. Historically, redundancy management and applications such as flight control and vehicle management tended to be highly coupled. One of the technologies that the X-33 will demonstrate is the Redundancy Management System (RMS) that uncouples the applications from the redundancy management details, in the same way that real-time operating systems have uncoupled applications from task scheduling, communication and synchronization details", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "May 2001", "inspec": "6952953", "date": "May 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "23 - 28", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["L.
