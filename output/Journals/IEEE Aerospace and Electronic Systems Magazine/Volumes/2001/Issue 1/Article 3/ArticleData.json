Current algorithms for determining the delay-time before the detonation of a missile warhead rely on human effort and experience and are, in general, deficient. We show that by applying genetic programming, an evolutionary optimization technique, determination of the timing can be automated and made near-optimal. A simulation study is discussed", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "41", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "45", "date_publication": "Jan 2001", "inspec": "6828437", "date": "Jan 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "41 - 45", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["H.
