The addition of a cost-effective guidance and control package to the rocket results in a weapon system that can defeat the target at ranges up to 70 km with significantly fewer rounds. This not only increases the destructive capability of the system but also reduces the cost of the expended ammunition, the cost to transport the ammunition to the combat zone, and the number of launchers required to execute the mission. The guidance kit is housed in the nose of the MLRS and consists of an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), four independent electromechanically actuated canards, a GPS receiver, GPS antennas, a thermal battery, a guidance computer, and power supply electronics. Roll decoupling of the warhead and motor section was required to allow roll control of the guidance section to enable accurate inertial navigation and was accomplished by joining the two sections with a roll bearing. Five flight missiles were built and tested during the ATD. A tightly coupled eight channel GPS receiver was flown on all flights. This paper discusses the ATD development effort and presents flight test results", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "33", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "39", "date_publication": "Jan 2001", "inspec": "6828436", "date": "Jan 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "33 - 39", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
