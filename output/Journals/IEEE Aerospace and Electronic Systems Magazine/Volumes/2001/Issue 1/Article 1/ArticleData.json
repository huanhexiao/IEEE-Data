The first VRLA aircraft batteries were cylindrical cell design and evolved to a prismatic design to save weight, volume, and to increase rate capability. This paper discusses the next generation of the VRLA aircraft battery. The HORIZON composite grid VRLA design reduces weight, increases high rate performance, and is expected to increase service life. This paper discusses the weight reduction over the present 30 Ah prismatic VRLA aircraft battery design; improvements in high rate engine start performance, and present status of the development effort. Finally, the paper discusses the applications for the 30 Ah composite grid VRLA aircraft battery, and shows the future application opportunities for light-weight VRLA, both in the military and commercially", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "29", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "32", "date_publication": "Jan 2001", "inspec": "6828435", "date": "Jan 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "29 - 32", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["B.
