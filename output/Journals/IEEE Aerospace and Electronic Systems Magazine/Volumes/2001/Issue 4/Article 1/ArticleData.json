The information can be protected by the user with his Personal Identification Number (PIN), or through biometrics. Unfortunately, there is not a smart card today that can verify the biometric template inside it, performing this task in the terminal. The author has developed the algorithms and data structures needed to solve this problem. Therefore, he has created a smart card with user biometric authentication, based on an Open Platform smart card (in this case, a JavaCard). To achieve these results, different biometric techniques have been studied: speaker verification, hand geometry and iris recognition. Experimental results are given to show the viability of the prototype developed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "6", "date_publication": "April 2001", "inspec": "6915085", "date": "April 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "4", "pages": "3 - 6", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
