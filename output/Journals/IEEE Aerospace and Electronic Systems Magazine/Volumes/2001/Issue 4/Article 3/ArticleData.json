The satellites measure weather phenomena as the primary mission and X-rays and charged particles as the secondary missions. This paper describes the GOES electrical power subsystem (EPS) requirements, architecture, hardware and energy balance analysis. As of this writing, the design of the EPS has completed the critical design review phase and the hardware has entered the manufacturing phase", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "Apr 2001", "inspec": "6915087", "date": "Apr 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "4", "pages": "23 - 28", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["W.
