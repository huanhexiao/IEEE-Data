T/R modules, even when low cost, drive the total RF system cost to an undesirable level, resulting in fewer systems being purchased, This paper reviews the application of continuous transverse stub (CTS) antenna technology to reduce the number of T/R modules required and, thus, the overall RF system cost, and military and civil applications and their respective cost savings", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "29", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "38", "date_publication": "Apr 2001", "inspec": "6915088", "date": "Apr 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "4", "pages": "29 - 38", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["T.
