In part, making the avionics platform cost effective means adhering to open standards and supporting the integration of COTS products with custom products. Inherently, operation in space requires low power, mass, and volume while retaining high performance, reconfigurability, scalability, and upgradability. The Universal Mini-Controller (UMC) project is based on a modified PC/104-Plus architecture while maintaining full compatibility with standard COTS PC/104 products. The architecture consists of a library of stackable building block modules, which can be mixed and matched to meet a specific application. A set of NASA developed core building blocks, (e.g. processor card, analog input/output card, high level analog card, and a Mil-Std-1553 card) were constructed to meet critical functions and unique interfaces", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "7", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "21", "date_publication": "Apr 2001", "inspec": "6915086", "date": "Apr 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "4", "pages": "7 - 21", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["L.
