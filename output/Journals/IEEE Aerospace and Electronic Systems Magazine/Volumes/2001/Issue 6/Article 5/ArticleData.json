Desired future capabilities and advanced functions, such as RPA, require the throughput, bandwidth, and memory provided by commercial processors and data buses. The primary issues needing resolution prior to implementation are related to operations in military rotorcraft environment, reliability, redundancy management, and fault and battle damage tolerance. In addition, some required network components presently do not exist in the preferred form factors. The ROSA project is providing effective laboratory demonstrations of COTS products and open systems specifications and standards to rotorcraft avionics. Preliminary cost estimates forecast large potential savings and create a compelling business case for follow-on research and transition to production systems. In addition, the project is developing a Rotorcraft Technical Architecture with the participation of many industry partners and will promote the resulting documentation as background materials for the JTA-A", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "36", "date_publication": "Jun 2001", "inspec": "6967127", "date": "Jun 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "31 - 36", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
