Today's systems run multiple parallel tasks, distribute testing among many computers, and publish live data through the Internet to achieve faster performance, better reliability, and increased connectivity with enterprise-wide systems. Specifically, software technologies and techniques will be examined for developing and running parallel, distributed automated tests and distributing test data between applications or across the Internet. If used correctly, the result of these techniques is a higher performance, more robust test system. In addition, we will examine technologies that make creating these parallel, distributed systems possible for not only the advanced test program developer, but also the novice user", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "6", "date_publication": "Jun 2001", "inspec": "6967122", "date": "Jun 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "3 - 6", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["E.
