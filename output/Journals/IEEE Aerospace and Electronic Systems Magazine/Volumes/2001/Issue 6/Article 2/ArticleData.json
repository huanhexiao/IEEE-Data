This is a research effort for testing printed circuit boards independent of traditional automatic test equipment (ATE) through the fabrication of MTE within integrated circuits (ICs). The MTE is embedded within the IC substrate and encapsulated within nanoprobes that connect between the surface and the substrate of the IC at various functional areas. A process is followed whereby IC device simulation is performed to assess the electrical, chemical, and structural properties of integrated and adjacent substrate devices. Through this approach the nominal and failed device performance parameters of interest to substrate-based MTE are found. Discussion of the development and application of MTE within IC architectures is provided, including such topics as the effect of substrate composition on the design and realization of MTE, interfaces between MTE and IC devices, and reporting of MTE results to the IC surface and technician. Potential application areas within different device functions will also be identified. A chemical structure diagram is also provided to illustrate the implementation of MTE using discrete device configurations with MTE-augmented logic", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "19", "date_publication": "Jun 2001", "inspec": "6967124", "date": "Jun 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "15 - 19", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
