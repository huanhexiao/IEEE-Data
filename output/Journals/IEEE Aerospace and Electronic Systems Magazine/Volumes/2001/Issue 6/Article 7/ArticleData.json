This paper will introduce a revolutionary approach to functional board test program development that combines the comprehensiveness of software-based simulation with the speed and simplicity of hardware emulation. The result is a functional Test Program Set development system that can produce high fault coverage, diagnostic test programs in a fraction of the time it takes using traditional techniques, and at a lower unit cost. In this paper we will first provide a brief background on the strengths and weaknesses of current software and hardware TPS development techniques-simulation hot mock-up. Next, the new approach is described in detail and contrasted against the existing techniques. Finally, actual experience to date using a prototyped system is presented", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "43", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "46", "date_publication": "Jun 2001", "inspec": "6967129", "date": "Jun 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "43 - 46", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
