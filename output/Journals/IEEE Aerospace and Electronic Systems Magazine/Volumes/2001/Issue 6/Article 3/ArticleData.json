We can see today that the foresight of the original JTAG committee was excellent. For several years after adoption of the standard, relatively few users had implemented boundary-scan solutions in their production lines. Now, however, for a number of reasons, interest in boundary-scan has rapidly intensified: (i) IC manufacturers have accepted boundary-scan as a feature that must be included in new ICs; (ii) Advances in board and IC Packaging technologies have accelerated, making new test strategies imperative; and (iii) Standard tools for engineering and production are now available to support boundary-scan, dramatically reducing test development effort, capital investments, along with a corresponding reduction in time to market. As a result, virtually every manufacturer of modern electronic boards has either adopted boundary-scan or faces difficult problems in manufacturing that could be resolved through boundary-scan. This presentation examines recent developments in boundary-scan technology as it relates to the development and production environments. Advanced tools, packaged to meet the needs of these environments, have brought boundary-scan into its prime. A detailed description of life-cycle implementation of boundary-scan is provided covering R&D, the factory, and service", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "Jun 2001", "inspec": "6967125", "date": "Jun 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "21 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
