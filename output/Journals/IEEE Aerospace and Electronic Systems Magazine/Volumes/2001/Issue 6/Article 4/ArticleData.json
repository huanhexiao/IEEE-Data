A systematic software change process is essential for the maintenance and reuse of safety-critical software. This paper presents activities to consider when changing software in safety-critical systems. The focus is on the aviation industry; however, the concepts are also applicable to other safety-critical domains, such as medical or nuclear", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "Jun 2001", "inspec": "6967126", "date": "Jun 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "25 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["L.
