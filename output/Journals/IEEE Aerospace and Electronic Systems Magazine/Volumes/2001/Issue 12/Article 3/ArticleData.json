This article describes the 1/f-noise tests and the associated test system for the 70 GHz demonstrator receiver, which can either use single or dual channel phase switcher methods. The 1/f knee frequency is shown to depend on the calculation method of the r-value. A minimum 1/f knee frequency around 10 mHz has been achieved with full two channel foxtrot and individually adopted r-values for each phase states while a straightforward single phase technology cannot go below 40 mHz", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "Dec 2001", "inspec": "7164250", "date": "Dec 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "12", "pages": "19 - 23", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
