In particular, mobile-IP will play a major role in the Advanced Aeronautic Transportation Technology (AATT), the Weather Information Communication (WINCOMM) and the Small Aircraft Transportation System; (SATS) aeronautics programs. This paper describes mobile-IP and mobile-routers-in particular, the features, capabilities, and initial performance of the mobile-router is presented. The application of mobile-router technology to NASA's space and aeronautics programs is also discussed", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "Dec 2001", "inspec": "7164249", "date": "Dec 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "12", "pages": "13 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["K.
