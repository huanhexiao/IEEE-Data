Deep Space 1 successfully demonstrated electric propulsion as the primary propulsion source for a satellite. The POWOW concept is a solar-electric propelled spacecraft capable of significant cargo and short trip times for traveling to Mars. It would enter aerosynchronous orbit and from there, beam power to surface installations via lasers. The concept has been developed with industrial partner expertise in high efficiency solar cells, advanced concentrator modules, innovative arrays, and high power electric propulsion systems. The latest version of the spacecraft, the technologies used, and trip times to Mars are presented. The POWOW spacecraft is a general purpose solar electric propulsion system that uses new technologies that are directly applicable to commercial and government spacecraft with power levels ranging from a LEO power level of 4 kW up to GEO spacecraft about 1 MW. The system is modular, expandable, and amenable to learning curve cost projection methods", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "7", "date_publication": "Feb 2001", "inspec": "6861706", "date": "Feb 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "3 - 7", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["H.
