This is impractical for scenarios such as checkpoints where a large number of individuals are entering at a high rate, necessitating the employment of other methods. Currently, checkpoint officers must make a quick decision to determine if an individual is being deceptive, and if, in turn, they should be searched. The remote detection of deception (RDD) concept uses a non-contact sensor to obtain physiological information that can be used to aid the checkpoint officer's decision. Such a device must be able to sense physiological signals from the body that may indicate deception in an unobtrusive and non-contact manner", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "10", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "14", "date_publication": "Aug 2001", "inspec": "7051503", "date": "Aug 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "10 - 14", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
