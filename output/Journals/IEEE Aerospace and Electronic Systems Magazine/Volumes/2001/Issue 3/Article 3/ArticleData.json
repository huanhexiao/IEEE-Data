This paper presents an optimized converter design approach that takes into consideration non-linear interactions among various converter components, source and load. It is shown that with the development of high-temperature, high-power SiC power module technology, magnetic components and capacitors become important technology challenges, and cannot be ignored. A 50% improvement in power density is calculated for a 100 V-2 kV, 7 kW SiC DC-DC power converter operating at 150\u00b0C compared to a silicon power converter. The SiC power converter can be operated at junction temperatures in excess of 300\u00b0C (as compared to 150\u00b0C for a silicon power converter) with reasonable efficiency that potentially leads to a significant reduction in thermal management", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "31", "date_publication": "Mar 2001", "inspec": "6889253", "date": "Mar 2001", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "27 - 31", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["K.
