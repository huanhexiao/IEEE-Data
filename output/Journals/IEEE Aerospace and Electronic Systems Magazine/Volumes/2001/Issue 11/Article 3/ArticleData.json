Such deficiencies are the non-idealities of amplitude and phase characteristics of sub-arrays and active modules. The idea of the suggested method is to store measured pattern characteristics into the antenna's internal memory at delivery and later, during operation, to use this data to support, for example, a beam forming algorithm, or just to create a static optimum. Thus, the antenna \"knows\" its behaviour. This method is both more cost-effective than a fine tuning of the hardware items on the production line, and often, the only choice, if relatively inaccurate sheet metal antennas are considered; but naturally, requires some active RF hardware. Our tests demonstrate S-band patterns within 2 dB or 3\u00b0 of the theoretical ones if an EPROM database at 1\u00b0 intervals is used. The improvement of the depth of wanted minima can exceed 12 dB", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "Nov 2001", "inspec": "7109508", "date": "Nov 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "11", "pages": "21 - 25", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
