An examination of the characteristics of present and future generation GaAs integrated circuits indicates that they will emphasize moderate on-chip gate counts and high gate speeds. Complete advantage can be taken of GaAs digital technology only if traditional signal processor architectures are completely recast at the memory layout, logic design, arithmetic implementation, and system architecture levels, and if these issues are considered in combination with system, logic board, and chip layout and packaging constraints in a single integrated approach.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "30", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "33", "date_publication": "Aug. 1987", "date": "Aug. 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "8", "pages": "30 - 33", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Barry K.
