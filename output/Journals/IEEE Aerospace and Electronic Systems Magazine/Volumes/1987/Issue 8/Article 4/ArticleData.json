MIL-STD-461 permits and encourages ``tailoring'' the EMI specifications for each equipment to the anticipated usage. In this paper, the Naval Avionics Center Staff Engineer for Electromagnetic Effects presents a typical tailored EMI specification as used within the Naval Air Systems Command to procure carrier based aircraft avionics. Included are the rationale for and the explanation of each modification and an estimate of the electromagnetic environment found aboard the US Navy Aircraft carriers.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "Aug. 1987", "date": "Aug. 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "8", "pages": "13 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Robert G.
