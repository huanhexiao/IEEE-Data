More recently, thin film transistor (TFT) and sensor devices have been developed for consumer and business products. The ability to produce large area uniform films of a-Si:H makes the application of TFTs and sensors well suited for input and output imaging devices such as image scanners, display and printers. This paper reviews the operation, material issues and physics of a-Si:H TFTs and sensors. The circuit and technology issues in large area systems incorporating these devices are described.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "Aug. 1987", "date": "Aug. 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "8", "pages": "25 - 29", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Malcolm J.
