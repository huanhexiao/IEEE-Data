The delicate balance between global and oceanic systems, however, may be altered due to the increased warming of the earth's average surface temperature. A few degrees increase could cause a 15-17 cm sea level rise by the year 2000, resulting in wide spread flooding of low lying areas. Recent studies indicate the global sea level is rising and extensive coastal flooding is anticipated. If these changes continue through the next century, we may be faced with a loss of our present culture. Oscillating sea levels since the late Pleistocene at times have left the floors of the continental margins and inland seas exposed, increasing the total earth's land surface by 8%. It was during these events that North America and island refugia including England, Indonesia, Japan and Australia were invaded and colonized by man. However, the swinging sea levels and shoreline displacements of as much as 120 m per year must have been very disruptive to the inhabitants of the coastal region and evidence of their cultures must have eroded away due to the relentless cycle of the coastal processes.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "8", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "11", "date_publication": "July 1987", "date": "July 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "7", "pages": "8 - 11", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Arthur J.
