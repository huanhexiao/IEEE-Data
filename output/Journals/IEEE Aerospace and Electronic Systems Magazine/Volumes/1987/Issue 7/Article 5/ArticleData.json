A local-area network for the factory is an option capable of solving data requirements. In addition, factory operation complexity can be reduced by centralizing data and developing robust applications; these applications should fulfill data organization, integrity, and access requirements and be an operator's interface to the automated factory.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "21", "date_publication": "July 1987", "date": "July 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "7", "pages": "18 - 21", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["T.
