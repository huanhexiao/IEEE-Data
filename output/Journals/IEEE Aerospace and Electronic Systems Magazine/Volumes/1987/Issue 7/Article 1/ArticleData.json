Capsized in a squall on August 8, 1813, they lie 300 feet deep, 1,500 feet apart, 6 miles off present-day Port Dalhousie, Ontario. They are world-class archaeological treasures: intact, with all their artifacts in and around them, and perfectly preserved. They belong to the City of Hamilton, Ontario, where an international-level museum will be constructed. A major archaeological dive is planned for April/May, 1987. The HAMILTON-SCOURGE team is now involved in a research project related to merchant activity on Lake Ontario, 1800-1812. It is hoped that this will result in finding the vessels' plans or offsets, if these still exist. Many fascinating historical details have been uncovered, some of which are recounted here.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "2", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "7", "date_publication": "July 1987", "date": "July 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "7", "pages": "2 - 7", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Emily Cain"], "keywords": ["Marine vehicles", "Sonar", "Temperature measurement", ""], "arnumber": "5005434"}
