TRANSIT continues to carry out its function of precise, reliable, all weather navigation for the United States Navy and nearly 80,000 worldwide commercial users. TRANSIT's utility has been expanded to provide precise positioning information to those in the fields of geodesy and doppler surveying. While TRANSIT's history is illustrious, its life is limited. The transition from TRANSIT as the Navy's satellite navigation system to NAVSTAR GPS is planned for the 1990' s, with the result that TRANSIT is now scheduled for phase out by the United States Navy in 1994. This paper (essentially an update of reference [1]) will show the current status and plans for TRANSIT, following a brief historical overview.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "July 1987", "date": "July 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "7", "pages": "25 - 26", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["O.
