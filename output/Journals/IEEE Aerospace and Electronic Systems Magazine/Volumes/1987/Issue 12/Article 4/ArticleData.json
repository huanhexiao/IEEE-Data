In selecting the NAVSAT architecture, special care has been devoted to different satellite constellation alternatives in order to identify the most promising solution in terms of navigation performance and system cost. The paper describes the present NAVSAT baseline and status. This baseline while offering precise navigation performance comparable or better than GPS, cuts significantly the overall cost of a satellite navigation system. The particular constellation selected is also easing the set up of the integrated navigation-communications-search and rescue service.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "Dec. 1987", "date": "Dec. 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "12", "pages": "15 - 22", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
