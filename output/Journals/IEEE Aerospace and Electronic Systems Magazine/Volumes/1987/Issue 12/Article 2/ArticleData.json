Its earliest form, LORAN-A, served us well up to the time the last station was taken off the air in December 1980. It was succeeded by LORAN-C as part of the Department of Defense's program to develop a new generation of radionavigation aids. LORAN-C not only has a greater range than LORAN-A but also provides better accuracy. With the declining cost of integrated circuits, LORAN-C receivers are becoming more affordable. This, along with good repeatable accuracy and excellent coverage, is increasing the worldwide popularity of navigation with LORAN-C. Fishermen, recreational boaters and the general aviation community make up a good percentage of this dramatic increase (an additional 75,000 marine and 10,000 aviation users the past year alone).", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "8", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "Dec. 1987", "date": "Dec. 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "12", "pages": "8 - 10", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Adeste F.
