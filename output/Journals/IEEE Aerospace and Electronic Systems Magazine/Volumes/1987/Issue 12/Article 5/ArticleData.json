The MLS provides the ability to determine the aircraft's position in three dimensional space over a large coverage volume in the airport terminal area. This affords the capability to navigate and execute approaches throughout this volume of coverage. This technique is known as Microwave Landing System Area Navigation (MLS RNAV). In order to assess and further develop the potential capabilities of MLS RNAV, the FAA Technical Center has undertaken the tasks of performing analytical studies, as well as the development of a prototype MLS RNAV system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "Dec. 1987", "date": "Dec. 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "12", "pages": "23 - 28", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["James Remer", "Barry Billmann"], "keywords": ["Aerospace control", "Aircraft navigation", "FAA", "Microwave devices", "Multilevel systems", "Radio transmitters", ""], "arnumber": "5005298"}
