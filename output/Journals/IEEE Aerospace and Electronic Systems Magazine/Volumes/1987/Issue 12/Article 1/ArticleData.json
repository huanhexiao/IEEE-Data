The model is used as the basis for a computer simulation of how things would look when viewed through a NASTYGLASS window. Some computer-generated, TV-displayed images of `Einstein-in-NASTYGLASS' are included. Finally, future research is proposed, research that just might lead to a Nobel prize in medicine or physiology!", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "2", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "7", "date_publication": "Dec. 1987", "date": "Dec. 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "12", "pages": "2 - 7", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Paul J.
