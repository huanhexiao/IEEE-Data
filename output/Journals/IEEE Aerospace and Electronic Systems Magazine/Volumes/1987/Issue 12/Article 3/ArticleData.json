The increased coverage will expand the number of airports approved for LORAN-C non-precision instrument approaches and enable direct Instrumental Flight Rules (IFR) routing by suitably equipped aircraft in and through the mid-continent region of the United States. The project will involve construction of a new LORAN-C chain which will be linked to the existing CONUS chains. In addition to the aviation benefits, the Mid-Continent LORAN-C Expansion will broaden the availability of LORAN-C positioning to a growing number of terrestrial users such as resource management, emergency response and fleet management.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "14", "date_publication": "Dec. 1987", "date": "Dec. 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "12", "pages": "11 - 14", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Andrew J.
