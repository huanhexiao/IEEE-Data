Following a number of experimental and demonstration vehicles, two prototype 250MPH 100-passenger inter-city vehicles, TRO6, were built, along with an elaborate 20-mile test facility where revenue service can be simulated. Following a period of initial testing by the Transrapid consortium, the operation of the test facility was turned over to a consortium of the German airlines (Lufthansa), German railroad (DB) and a testing house. This consortium is evaluating the suitability of the Transrapid MagLev for revenue service under the complete range of operating conditions. At this time, approximately 200 runs have been made, for a total of 7,000 miles at speeds up to 220MPH (the maximum achievable until the completion of the southern loop.)", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "5", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "Feb. 1987", "date": "Feb. 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "2", "pages": "5 - 8", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["William W.
