Formerly, rendezvous has been expensive in terms of time and crew involvement. Multiple trajectory adjustments on separate orbits have been required to meet safety, lighting, and geometry requirements. This paper describes a new guidance technique in which the approach trajectory is shaped by a sequence of velocity increments in order to satisfy multiple constraints within a single orbit. The approach phase is planned before the mission, leaving a group of free parameters that are optimized by onboard guidance. Fuel penalties are typically a few percent, compared to unshaped Hohmann transfers, and total fuel costs can be less than those of more time-consuming ways of meeting the same requirements.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "Feb. 1987", "date": "Feb. 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "2", "pages": "17 - 22", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Allan R.
