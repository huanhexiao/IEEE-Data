Emphasis is on a core program that is directed to (1) the creation and maintenance of a generic research base in integrated circuit technologies in the U.S. university community, (2) ensuring a continuing supply of highly qualified students to support the growth and continuing innovation within the industry (and the faculty required to educate them), and (3) the broadening of the U.S. university base of microelectronics research and education through establishment of centers of excellence, seeding of new efforts, and development of new curricula.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "11", "date_publication": "Feb. 1987", "date": "Feb. 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "2", "pages": "9 - 11", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
