First half of phase B study of JEM was completed last March successfully. JEM primary function and basic configuration has been established. JEM consists of a Pressurized Module (PM), an Exposed Facility (EF), a scientific/equipment airlock, a local remote manipulator, and an Experimental Logistic Module (ELM). With all those hardware elements, JEM will accommodate general scientific and technology development research (some of which are to utilize the advantage of microgravity environment), and also accommodate control panels for the Space Station Mobile Remote Manipulator System and attached payloads.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "Jan. 1987", "date": "Jan. 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "1", "pages": "17 - 23", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Hideo Hasegawa"], "keywords": ["Control systems", "Gases", "Logistics", "NASA", "Payloads", "Sociotechnical systems", "Space stations", "Space technology", ""], "arnumber": "5005224"}
