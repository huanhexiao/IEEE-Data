Station accommodations need to be versatile and operationally flexible to permit integration of many types of equipment in a variety of modes; and autonomous to render each payload independent or invisible to the rest of the system and other mission equipment. This paper presents the various categories of Space Station payloads, the user facilities that are being designed to accommodate them, illustrates through scientific and commercial scenarios the utilization of those facilities, and identifies the factors that must be considered to make the Space Station an effective tool for the users.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "17", "date_publication": "Jan. 1987", "date": "Jan. 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "1", "pages": "13 - 17", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["T.
