The objective is to provide a perspective of total integrated system performance which illuminates broad requirements issues rather than specific subsystem specifications. The fundamental premise is that avionics requirements are driven by four factors; Information and Data Sources, Control Opportunities and Information Needs, Concepts and Algorithmic Techniques, and Realization Technologies. These four factors are set in a systems structure which shows their inter-relationships and provides the framework for conceptualizing avionics system solutions to meet particular mission needs. Three generic mission areas are considered and an examination is made of the issues of fielding and affording the solution with specific emphasis on architecture, fusion, production, and support.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "5", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "9", "date_publication": "Nov. 1987", "date": "Nov. 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "11", "pages": "5 - 9", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Harvey M.
