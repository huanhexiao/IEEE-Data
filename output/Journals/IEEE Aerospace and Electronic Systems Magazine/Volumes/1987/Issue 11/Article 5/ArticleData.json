A description of this experience, along with related design agent key responsibilities, is presented as a backdrop to a discussion of design agent relevance to future acquisition requirements. Other applications of the design agent concept to avionics are described, along with recommendations for future 6.3 programs.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "20", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "Nov. 1987", "date": "Nov. 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "11", "pages": "20 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["William J.
