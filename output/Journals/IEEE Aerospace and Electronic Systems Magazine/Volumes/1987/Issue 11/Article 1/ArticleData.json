In the early conceptual phase, aeronautical system designers give scant attention to designing the avionics components. The design team generally provides weight, volume and power considerations for the desired avionics functions and assumes that an avionics suite can be assembled. Less than comprehensive attention is given to the interacting effect avionics have with the other system components. In contrast, the designers expend a very large effort on finding the best balanced combination of airframe and propulsion components which satisfy the design objectives. This paper shows why avionics must be a co-equal member of the aeronautical system along with airframe, propulsion, and armament. To become a co-equal partner, avionics must be an element of the system design iterations and analysis commencing with the early conceptual design phase of a new aeronautical system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "2", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "4", "date_publication": "Nov. 1987", "date": "Nov. 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "11", "pages": "2 - 4", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Gordon F.
