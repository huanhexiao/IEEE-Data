The OMS would be distributed both in space and on the ground, and provide a transparent interface to the communications and data processing facilities of the Space Station Program. The allocation of OMS responsibilities has, in the most curent Space Station design, been fragmented among the Communications and Tracking Subsystem (CTS), the Data Management System (DMS), and a redefined OMS. In this current view, OMS is less of a participant in the real-time processing, and more an overseer of the health and management of the Space Station operations.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "Oct. 1987", "date": "Oct. 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "10", "pages": "19 - 23", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Terry R.
