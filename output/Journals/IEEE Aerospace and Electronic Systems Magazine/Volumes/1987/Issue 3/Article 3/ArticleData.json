Extensive testing during Phase I and II of the program has proven that the GPS provides a quantum improvement over the capabilities of existing navigational systems and significant mission enhancement in a broad range of military operations. Production of the Block II satellites is progressing on schedule, but the space shuttle accident will delay completion of the full constellation by about two years. The Control Segment is fully operational and will transition to Space Command in 1987. The user equipment will enter production and undergo further testing during the LRIP period to ensure that service operational effectiveness and suitability requirements are met before commencing full-rate production. The GPS should be fully operational in the early 1990's and will provide a powerful force enhancer for all the military services for many years to come.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "March 1987", "date": "March 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "3", "pages": "9 - 12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Wayne H.
