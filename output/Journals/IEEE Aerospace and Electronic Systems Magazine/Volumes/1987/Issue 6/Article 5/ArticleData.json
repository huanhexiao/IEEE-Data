The avionics, which include flight controls, inertial attitude reference, recovery guidance, payload and data link, represent more than 80 percent of the cost of the vehicle. The key cost drivers are the payload and data link which must accommodate long stand-off range and rapid AV jinking for good survivability, day and night operation, high radio jamming conditions, and high-precision laser pointing accuracy. However, there are many RPV applications which are less demanding and can therefore take advantage of substantial cost reductions. Lockheed Research & Development Division is addressing this need by defining flexible, adaptive, avionics concepts which emphasize the nondevelopmental philosophy. One such system is the Lockheed Adaptive Modular Payload (LAMP). This system promotes use of a standard universal two-axis gimbal platform into which many different forms of imaging sensors can be installed. This concept is aimed at reconnaissance and surveillance. It is now being integrated into the future RPV programs at the Lockheed Austin Division.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "24", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "June 1987", "date": "June 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "6", "pages": "24 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
