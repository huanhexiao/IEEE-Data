They have been used as a framework to establish and guide the introduction of a wide use of similar methods for the future avionics of Boeing's next airplane, the 7J7. The methods were designed to improve communication of the system's requirements, architecture and implementation to a wide group of interested parties ?? not just the development engineers but also the users, maintainers, customers and support organizations. A major aspect of these methods is that they were designed to be used for systems in general not just software systems. This paper will describe the background and goals and objectives leading to the need for systems engineering methods, describe the methods and give an example of their use. It will conclude with remarks on steps taken to introduce methods of this type on a wide scale to support the next Boeing airplane.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "2", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "June 1987", "date": "June 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "6", "pages": "2 - 8", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Paul Ebner Gartz"], "keywords": ["Aerospace electronics", "Crisis management", "Flexible manufacturing systems", "Power system management", "Power system planning", "Software development management", "Software systems", "Systems engineering and theory", ""], "arnumber": "5005412"}
