The Integrated Communication Navigation Identification Avionics program (ICNIA), and ITT/TI Joint Venture, is accomplishing this task with a combination of modular circuit designs using VHSIC technology, improved packaging designs incorporating surface mount component technology and a modular two-level maintenance support concept for reduced life cycle cost. This article will concentrate on the modular packaging technology of the digital processor subsystem.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "20", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "June 1987", "date": "June 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "6", "pages": "20 - 23", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Frank Poradish"], "keywords": ["Aerospace electronics", "Circuit synthesis", "Fault tolerance", "Integrated circuit reliability", "Integrated circuit technology", "International collaboration", "Navigation", "Reconfigurable architectures", "Surface-mount technology", ""], "arnumber": "5005417"}
