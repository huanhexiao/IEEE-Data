The architecture described in this paper is easily upgradable and features deep integration, a high degree of modularity and common modules structured around standard interfaces. These features give the architecture a degree of flexibility and technology robustness seldom found in military applications. Although the requirements driving the architecture were developed from land combat vehicle applications, the architecture is equally applicable to any embedded system. This paper describes the architecture, its key attributes and benefits, and stresses the importance of standard interfaces.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "14", "date_publication": "June 1987", "date": "June 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "6", "pages": "9 - 14", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["V.
