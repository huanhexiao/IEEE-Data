Looking at a map while driving creates a poor traffic situation, one even more acute for drivers of emergency service vehicles. To address this problem, development engineers at the General Motors Technical Cener and Delco Electronics integrated an experimental GPS receiver into a GM Buick Park Avenue. The receiver is designed to acquire and sequentially track signals from four satellites. The vehicle's precise latitude, longitude, and altitude are determined and presented on a color cathode ray tube (CRT) map display in the car's instrument panel.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "2", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "5", "date_publication": "May 1987", "date": "May 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "5", "pages": "2 - 5", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Ronald A.
