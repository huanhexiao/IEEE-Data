The results of these efforts balance the conflicting needs of civil GPS navigation and positioning against national security requirements. Granting this access will require sufficient and demonstrable user need, must clearly provide for both national and security interests, and may lead to the imposition of a user service charge. This access will only apply to Precise Positioning Service configured, code-tracking GPS receivers.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "26", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "May 1987", "date": "May 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "5", "pages": "26 - 29", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Michael J.
