Satellite-based navigation systems achieve high absolute accuracy but require dead reckoning augmentation because of signal aberrations in the automotive environment. Future systems will probably include multiple navigation technologies. Issues influencing the design of future systems include safety concerns regarding the driver interface, and the future availability of comprehensive map data bases, real-time traffic data, and mobile data communication links necessary for on-board generation of optimum routes.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "6", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "May 1987", "date": "May 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "5", "pages": "6 - 12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Robert L.
