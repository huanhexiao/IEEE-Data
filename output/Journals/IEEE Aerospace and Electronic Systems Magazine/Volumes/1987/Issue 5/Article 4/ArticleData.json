Space, Control, and User Equipment. The Space segment is responsible for the development and launch of the GPS satellite constellation. The Control segment is responsible for monitoring the satellite telemetry and providing updated navigation information to the satellites. The User Equipment (UE) segment is responsible for the development and procurement of the GPS receivers for a variety of host vehicle platforms. Recently, approval was given to the User segment to enter Low Rate Initial Production (LRIP). This approval marks the beginning of Phase III (production and deployment) of the GPS program. This paper will discuss the overall status of all three segments with an emphasis on the User Equipment segment as it enters the production phase of the program.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "21", "date_publication": "May 1987", "date": "May 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "5", "pages": "18 - 21", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Christopher E.
