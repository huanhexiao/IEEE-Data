These towers are for the Charleston Tactical Aircrew Combat Training System (CTACTS). The offshore portion of the CTACTS provides the necessary facilities to accurately monitor and control the training of Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force pilots, during aerial warfare training exercises. These offshore facilities are located 30 to 72 nautical miles east of northern Georgia in water depths ranging from 81 to 143 feet. In June, 1984, FPO-1 awarded the ocean tower design contract to Brown & Root Development, Inc. The final design was completed in August, 1985 and in January, 1986, FPO-1 awarded a contract to McDermott Marine Construction to fabricate and install the platforms. The installation is scheduled to be completed by mid-September, 1986.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "12", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Sept. 1987", "date": "Sept. 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "9", "pages": "12 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Thomas J.
