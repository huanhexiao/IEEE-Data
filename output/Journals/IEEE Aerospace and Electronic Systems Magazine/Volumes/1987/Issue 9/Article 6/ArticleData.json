These systems will rely on some form of electronic chart, which will require continual and timely updating with the latest correction information. This paper describes a newly developed chart correction computer system capable of automatically updating electronic charts via satellite data transfers. The system can provide a direct computer data link between a shipboard computer and the Defense Mapping Agency's Automated Notice to Mariners System.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "20", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "Sept. 1987", "date": "Sept. 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "9", "pages": "20 - 22", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Kevin P.
