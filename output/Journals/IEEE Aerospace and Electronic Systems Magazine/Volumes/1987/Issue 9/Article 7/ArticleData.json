Electronic chart and map display systems are now reaching the market for land, sea and air navigation and rapid delivery of the latest data is absolutely essential. Commercial aviation is moving rapidly toward the automated cockpit with the new generation Flight Management Computer System. Marine navigation is experiencing a similar growth in integrated navigation systems and every major automobile manufacturer has plans for digital map navigation systems. The largest, most complete data bases to meet these requirements are Government held and difficult to access, thus most private sector firms re-digitize and agencies maintain near duplicate data. Present inefficiencies, introduced errors, and delays stem from lack of rapid access and delivery of digital data. Use of newly developed satellite data broadcast technology offers a solution.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "Sept. 1987", "date": "Sept. 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "9", "pages": "23 - 25", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
