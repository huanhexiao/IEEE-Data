FDAD monitors user-defined memory addresses and hardware lines and displays in real-time the changes to these locations. Data is also stored for subsequent analysis and display. This tool allows developers to identify the operating characteristics of an extremely complex and fast system with the assurance that the instrumentation does not alter the true performance of that system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "5", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "7", "date_publication": "Sept. 1987", "date": "Sept. 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "9", "pages": "5 - 7", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Bruce Fenchel", "Joseph Auer"], "keywords": ["Data analysis", "Debugging", "Electronic countermeasures", "Hardware", "Software systems", "Software tools", "System testing", ""], "arnumber": "5005487"}
