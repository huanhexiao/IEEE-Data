The instrument is based on an intelligent data cruncher concept: Fast sensor data rates are stored and process to yield a variety of answers for each parameter, at slower data rates, as appropriate. Special methods are used to achieve these results with an average current drain of under one mA, including sensors. Sampling rates and processing algorithms are designed to correct for swaying ocean-deployed buoys. A modular approach to design allows many types of sensors to be accommodated and permits data dissemination to a variety of destinations; data is available for real-time transmission or for internal archiving. The Weather Station's high-capacity internal data storage system, coupled with its fast data acquisition rates, enable the instrument to be used for air turbulence measurements.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "16", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "19", "date_publication": "Sept. 1987", "date": "Sept. 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "9", "pages": "16 - 19", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Edward P.
