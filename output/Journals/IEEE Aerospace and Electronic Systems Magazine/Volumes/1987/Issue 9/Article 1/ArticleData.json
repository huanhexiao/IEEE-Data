Solid-state displays, voice recognition, and artificial intelligence are just a few of the emerging technologies that will help the pilot perform his mission in the future. Early investigations involving mission analysis, sensor data, software development, and evaluations will be required to insure total integration. These new technologies will require extensive human factors research in the areas of anthropometry, displays, controls, human/computer interface, automation, and workload assessment to support the integration process. This research will help provide weapons systems that have increased survivability and reduced pilot workload. This paper addresses some of the human factors research that will be needed to help develop future cockpit systems. It also reviews the basic evolution of the crew station and some of the emerging technologies that will drive human factors research in the 1990s. In the past, crew systems were designed to provide each aircraft function with a corresponding instrument display, such as airspeed indicator, altimeter, attitude direction indicator, vertical velocity indicator, etc. The bulk of the information had to be integrated by the pilot. Present systems are in a state of transition. We are rapidly moving from individual instruments to multifunction displays. The C-17, HH-60, F-15E, B-1B, F-111D, and F-16C/D aircraft use multifunction, cathode-ray tube displays, some of which are color. Another trend is the continued increase in the use of integrated controls.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "2", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "4", "date_publication": "Sept. 1987", "date": "Sept. 1987", "date_current_version": "Fri May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "9", "pages": "2 - 4", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Richard J.
