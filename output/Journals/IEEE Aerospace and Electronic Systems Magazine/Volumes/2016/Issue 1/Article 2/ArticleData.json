The system is based on software defined radio (SDR), a technique that is becoming more widespread whose use was approved by the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 2004 [12]. SDR allows the use of radio transceivers with minimal hardware, by replacing some hardware devices with rewritable software and editable algorithms. The biggest advantage of the SDR is the opportunity to reconfigure and modify the transceiver system characteristics according to the peculiarities of different standards. Examples of use of SDR are Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), Global System for Mobile (GSM), Digital Video Broadcast (DVB)-S/DVB-S2/DVB-T, Wimax, etc., where a common hardware is compatible with all of the above Telecommunications Standards.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "8", "volume": "31", "lastpage": "13", "date_publication": "January 2016", "inspec": "15754608", "date": "January 2016", "date_current_version": "Fri Jan 29 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "8 - 13", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Ilaria Lucresi", "Alessandro Di Carlofelice", "Piero Tognolatti", "Ilaria Lucresi", "Alessandro Di Carlofelice", "Piero Tognolatti"], "keywords": ["artificial satellites", "laser ranging", "radio transceivers", "satellite communication", "software radio", "Digital Video Broadcast", "Global System for Mobile", "SDR-based system", "Universal Mobile Telecommunications System", "Wimax", "geostationary satellite", "global network", "observation stations", "open-source programming environment", "pseudonoise techniques", "radio transceivers", "round-trip time", "satellite ranging measurements", "software defined radio", "ultrashort pulses", "Distance measurement", "Extraterrestrial measurements", "Geophysical measurements", "Low earth orbit satellites", "Payloads", "Satellite broadcasting", "Satellites", "Signal to noise ratio", "Time measurement", ""], "arnumber": "7395404"}
