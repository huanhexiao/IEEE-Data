A typical application of DTN is for reliable data delivery in deep-space communications, which is characterized by an extremely long signal propagation delay, random and lengthy link disruptions, lossy data links, and asymmetric channel rates. At present, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and several other space agencies consider DTN to be the most effective technology to handle the lengthy link delays and link disconnection inherent in deep-space communications. Bundle protocol (BP), developed as the main protocol of DTN, is used to build an overlay network and to provide custody-based, store-and-forward message transmission.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "31", "lastpage": "21", "date_publication": "January 2016", "inspec": "15754611", "date": "January 2016", "date_current_version": "Fri Jan 29 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "14 - 21", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Mingjian Qiu", "Ruhai Wang", "Kanglian Zhao", "Wenfeng Li", "Dongming Bian"], "keywords": ["delay tolerant networks", "protocols", "space communication links", "National Aeronautics and Space Administration", "RTO timer", "bundle protocol", "custody-based message transmission", "deep-space communications", "delay/disruption tolerant networking", "overlay network", "retransmission timeout timer", "space agencies", "store-and-forward message transmission", "stressed communication environment", "transmission efficiency", "Bandwidth", "Deep-space communication", "Delays", "Disruption tolerant networking", "Internet", "Overlay networks", "Propagation losses", "Receivers", ""], "arnumber": "7395405"}
