Moreover, the battery is frequently exposed to repetitive high power demand, which consequently shortens the battery lifetime [1]. To overcome these problems, many parallel connections of energy sources have been proposed by scientists with the aim to reduce high peak power supply and repetitive power, as well as to save battery energy and lengthen its use [2], [3]. In this article, a parallel supercapacitors (SCs)- batteries scheme for battery hybrid electric vehicle (BHEV) and its control are proposed. The configuration consists of a parallel connection of batteries and SCs, which are connected to the inverter via a bidirectional dc-dc converter, as shown in Figure 1. This scheme intends to save braking energy for extending the driving range. In order to control the voltage and current of SCs, the control algorithms, composed of cascaded voltage and current loops based on the acceleration-based design (ABD), are developed. For efficiency validation, comparison of the core features between 3 different system configurations are proposed: the proposed BHEV with acceleration-based design (BHEV-ABD), BHEV with load-based design (BHEV-LBD) [4], and a pure BEV.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "32", "volume": "31", "lastpage": "35", "date_publication": "January 2016", "inspec": "15754610", "date": "January 2016", "date_current_version": "Fri Jan 29 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "32 - 35", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Aree Wangsupphaphol", "Nik Rumzi Nik Idris"], "keywords": ["DC-DC power convertors", "acceleration", "battery powered vehicles", "hybrid electric vehicles", "acceleration-based design", "battery hybrid electric vehicle", "bidirectional dc-dc converter", "braking energy", "cascaded voltage", "current loops", "electric vehicle auxiliary energy source", "parallel connection", "parallel supercapacitors", "Acceleration", "Artificial neural networks", "Batteries", "Electric vehicles", "Mathematical model", "Real-time systems", "Voltage control", ""], "arnumber": "7395408"}
