This is the ninth tutorial issue published by IEEE AESS. The first one was published in January 2004. Three kinds of tutorial articles are offered. The first is a primer on an established topic, while the second introduces us to a topic of emerging importance. The third type of article is a survey of an established technical area. In all three cases, authors are for the most part noted experts willing to share their knowledge and experience in a written field guide. Tutorials IX presents four tutorials on emerging topics. The first article in this issue is a tutorial entitled \u201cDetection Over Sensor Networks: A Tutorial,\u201d by S. Hamed Javadi of the University of Bojnord, Bojnord, Iran (pages 2\u201318). This is a tutorial on the emerging topic of multisensor detection over a network. The application of sensor networks (SNs) to real-time remote information monitoring and processing is growing rapidly. Detection of an event is one of the main tasks of SNs in many applications. Sensors may transmit either raw or processed data to a fusion center (FC), where a final decision is taken. The problems and challenges associated with detection over SNs are reviewed, and existing methods for addressing these challenges along with recent advances are described in this tutorial.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "31", "lastpage": "1", "date_publication": "March 2016", "date": "March 2016", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 17 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "3", "pages": "1", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["William Dale Blair"], "keywords": ["Algebra", "Multisensor systems", "Peak to average power ratio", "Radar antennas", "Software", "Special issues and sections", "Tutorials", ""], "arnumber": "7475418"}
