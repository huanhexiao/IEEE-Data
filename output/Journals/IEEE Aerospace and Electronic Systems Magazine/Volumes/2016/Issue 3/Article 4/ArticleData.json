This seemingly simple concept leads to a rich system of algebra and calculus that encompasses the diverse areas of complex numbers, quaternions, vectors, tensors, spinors, and differential forms. This tutorial provides a basic introduction to geometric algebra and presents formulations of known electrical engineering and signal processing concepts to illustrate some inherent advantages of geometric algebra for formulating and solving problems involving vectors. Being introductory, the goal of the tutorial is to introduce this emerging area that, although old as a mathematics discipline, has only recently started to garner significant attention in engineering communities. Geometric algebra should give another potentially powerful tool for pursuing research in any area that uses vectors.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "32", "volume": "31", "lastpage": "69", "date_publication": "March 2016", "date": "March 2016", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 17 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "3", "pages": "32 - 69", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["K.
