Detection of an event is one of the main tasks of SNs in many applications. Sensors may transmit either raw or processed data to a fusion center (FC), where a final decision is taken. The problems and challenges that exist in detection over SNs and the previously proposed methods to deal with them are reviewed and described in this tutorial.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "2", "volume": "31", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "March 2016", "inspec": "16089293", "date": "March 2016", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 20 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "3", "pages": "2 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["S.
