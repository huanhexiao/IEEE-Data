Specifically, we consider the wrapped normal (WN) distribution and the von Mises distribution. We propose an estimation method for circular systems with nonlinear system and measurement functions. This is achieved by relying on efficient deterministic sampling techniques. Furthermore, we show how the calculations can be simplified in a variety of important special cases, such as systems with additive noise, as well as identity system or measurement functions, which are illustrated using an example from aeronautics. We introduce several novel key components, particularly a distribution-free prediction algorithm, a new and superior formula for the multiplication of WN densities, and the ability to deal with nonadditive system noise. All proposed methods are thoroughly evaluated and compared with several state-of-the-art approaches.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "70", "volume": "31", "lastpage": "87", "date_publication": "March 2016", "inspec": "16089292", "date": "March 2016", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 17 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "3", "pages": "70 - 87", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Gerhard Kurz", "Igor Gilitschenski", "Uwe D.
