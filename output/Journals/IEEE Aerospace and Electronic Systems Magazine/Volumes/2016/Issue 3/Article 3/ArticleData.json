Therefore, there is a genuine demand that the parameters of future radar systems be controlled through a software without changing any hardware or using amplitude/phase tapers. It is well known that the parameters of an antenna array radar can be controlled by transmitting suitable correlated waveforms. This approach provides more degree-of-freedom and if constant-envelope (CE) or low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) correlated waveforms are used, it allows us to control the parameters of the radar without changing any hardware. Therefore, this approach can be considered as a step towards a software radar. The aim of this article is to provide a survey of recent techniques used to design CE and low PAPR correlated waveforms and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "31", "lastpage": "31", "date_publication": "March 2016", "date": "March 2016", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 17 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "3", "pages": "19 - 31", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Sajid Ahmed", "Mohamed Alouini"], "keywords": ["Antenna arrays", "Covariance matrices", "MIMO radar", "Radar antennas", "Signal to noise ratio", "Transmitting antennas", "Tutorials", ""], "arnumber": "7475420"}
