The antenna has been designed on the basis of the specifications of the Tigrisat mission but is suit-able for more general cases. The antenna is fabricated on a square annular-ring substrate that allows hosting of a camera system for Earth observation. Different radiation patterns can be achieved by properly phasing the feeds of the four patches that constitute the antenna. A mission analysis for the nadir-pointing attitude case, which is the case of the Tigrisat satellite, has been performed in order to select the configuration that ensures better link performances. The selected configuration has an \"apple\"-shaped radiation pattern that resembles the isoflux configuration for which the path loss due to range variation is partly compensated by an increase of the off-nadir gain. The characterization of the fabricated antenna in anechoic chamber in terms of radiation pattern and impedance matching shows a very good agreement with simulation results.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "6", "volume": "31", "lastpage": "13", "date_publication": "May 2016", "inspec": "16089642", "date": "May 2016", "date_current_version": "Thu Jun 23 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "5", "pages": "6 - 13", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Erika Pittella", "Stefano Pisa", "Mauro Pontani", "Augusto Nascetti", "Paolo D'Atanasio", "Allessandro Zambotti", "Hussein Hadi"], "keywords": ["UHF antennas", "anechoic chambers (electromagnetic)", "antenna feeds", "antenna radiation patterns", "impedance matching", "microstrip antennas", "satellite antennas", "Earth observation", "Tigrisat mission", "Tigrisat satellite", "anechoic chamber", "apple-shaped radiation pattern", "camera system", "cubesat satellite", "impedance matching", "isoflux configuration", "mission analysis", "nadir-pointing attitude case", "off-nadir gain", "patch feed", "path loss", "reconfigurable S-band patch antenna system", "square annular-ring substrate", "Antenna radiation patterns", "Apertures", "Communications technology", "Patch antennas", "Reconfigurable architectures", "Remote sensing", "Satellites", ""], "arnumber": "7498197"}
