Despite its great importance, predicting the cost of developing complex high-technology systems and products, based a good deal on research and development, is difficult and carries a degree of uncertainty in the results. The difficulty of the process has been especially evident in projects for which there was little prior experience. Estimating satellite development costs has been just such an endeavor, in which history shows cost overruns are not uncommon.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "28", "volume": "31", "lastpage": "35", "date_publication": "May 2016", "inspec": "16089644", "date": "May 2016", "date_current_version": "Thu Jun 23 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "5", "pages": "28 - 35", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Yasin Karatas", "Fuat Ince"], "keywords": ["artificial satellites", "costing", "fuzzy systems", "cost estimation", "fuzzy expert tool", "satellite development costs", "small satellite cost estimation", "Analytical models", "Cost estimation", "Data models", "Mathematical model", "Predictive models", "Project management", "Satellites", ""], "arnumber": "7498200"}
