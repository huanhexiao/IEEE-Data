Considering the vehicle as a system requires the integration of engineering disciplines, such as mechanical, electrical, control, avionics, and software with potentially disparate design artifacts. This integration allows risk containment by improving the confidence in the system design at earlier stages of the system development.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "6", "volume": "31", "lastpage": "13", "date_publication": "April 2016", "date": "April 2016", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 17 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "4", "pages": "6 - 13", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Jose L.
