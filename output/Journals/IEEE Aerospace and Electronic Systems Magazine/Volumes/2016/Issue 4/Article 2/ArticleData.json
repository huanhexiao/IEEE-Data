Compared to conventional receivers, a software GNSS receiver offers better design flexibility and requires fewer dedicated hardware components [1]. An ideal software receiver typically processes all signals in a processor; however, this method is not efficient practically, because it becomes a computational burden for the processor. For this reason, frequent multiplications and operations are offloaded to hardware elements such as a field-programmable gate array (FPGA).", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "31", "lastpage": "19", "date_publication": "April 2016", "inspec": "16089299", "date": "April 2016", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 17 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "4", "pages": "14 - 19", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Surabhi Guruprasad", "Sunil Bisnath", "Regina Lee", "Janusz Kozinski"], "keywords": ["field programmable gate arrays", "satellite navigation", "signal processing", "system-on-chip", "FPGA", "SoC", "dedicated hardware component", "field-programmable gate array", "global navigation satellite system", "satellite transmission", "signal processing", "software GNSS receiver", "software receiver", "system on chip", "Field programmable gate arrays", "Global Positioning System", "Hardware", "Receivers", "Satellites", "Software", ""], "arnumber": "7493945"}
