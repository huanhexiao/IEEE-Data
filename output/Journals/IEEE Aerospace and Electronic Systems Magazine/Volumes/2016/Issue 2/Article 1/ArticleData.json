The following sections present an analysis of the current situation, followed by the technological developments carried out to address the identified problems. Details about the prototype integration and functional tests are also provided.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "6", "volume": "31", "lastpage": "15", "date_publication": "February 2016", "inspec": "15806057", "date": "February 2016", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 26 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "2", "pages": "6 - 15", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Javier Perez-Mato", "Victor Arana", "Francisco Cabrera-Almeida"], "keywords": ["geophysical techniques", "infrared imaging", "wildfires", "detection range", "georeferencing", "rapidly deployable mobile units", "real-time autonomous wildfire monitoring", "thermographic camera", "Aerospace electronics", "Emergency services", "Fires", "Mobile communication", "Real-time systems", "Satellites", "Three-dimensional displays", ""], "arnumber": "7419762"}
