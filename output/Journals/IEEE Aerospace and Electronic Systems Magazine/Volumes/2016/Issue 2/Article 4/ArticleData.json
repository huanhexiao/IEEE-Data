This miniaturized electronic is very convenient for short distance firings and can withstand accelerations of about 10,000 g. Associated to an software defined radio (SDR) reception chain, it offers great flexibility. Examples of firing data are given as well as calibrated results. This instrumentation has been successfully used for 6 DoF analysis of the ballistic attitude in postprocessing. Furthermore, the onboard electronics can also be used in combination with a real-time processing unit for the in-flight computation of the attitude angles of the projectile.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "32", "volume": "31", "lastpage": "40", "date_publication": "February 2016", "inspec": "15806059", "date": "February 2016", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 26 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "2", "pages": "32 - 40", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Loi\u0308c Bernard", "Ronan Adam", "Dirk Schmoltzi", "Clement Thomas", "Ju\u0308rgen Kreitz", "Armin Schneider"], "keywords": ["attitude measurement", "projectiles", "software radio", "6 DoF analysis", "accelerations", "attitude measurements", "ballistic attitude", "basic finner reference projectile", "flexibility", "instrumentation", "miniaturized electronic", "onboard electronics", "real-time processing unit", "short distance firings", "software defined radio reception chain", "supersonic velocities", "Accelerometers", "Attitude measurements", "Magnetic sensors", "Magnetometers", "Projectiles", "Transmitters", ""], "arnumber": "7419767"}
