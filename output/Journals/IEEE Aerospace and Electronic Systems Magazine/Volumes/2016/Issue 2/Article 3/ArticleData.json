Several specimens were fabricated by suitably alternating the reinforcement layers with films of the matrix having different intrinsic natures; some specimens were impacted at two energies. All the specimens (impacted or not) have been nondestructively evaluated with lock-in thermography (LT) that is a noncontact, noninvasive technique [10]. The obtained results have been analysed to obtain information on the role played by both the matrix and fibre-stacking sequence on the damage modes, as well as on the overall damage relevance.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "26", "volume": "31", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "February 2016", "inspec": "15806056", "date": "February 2016", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 26 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "2", "pages": "26 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Simone Boccardi", "Giovanni Maria Carlomagno", "Carosena Meola", "Domenico Acierno", "Giorgio Simeoli", "Salvatore Iannace", "Luigi Sorrentino", "Pietro Russo"], "keywords": ["impact strength", "infrared imaging", "laminates", "nondestructive testing", "polymers", "films", "hybrid polypropylene/glass composites", "impact damage modes", "interlaminar interface strength", "interlaminar-graded interphase strength laminated structures", "lock-in thermography", "noncontact technique", "noninvasive technique", "reinforcement layers", "Cameras", "Films", "Heating", "Laminates", "Safety", "Thermography", "Thermoplastics", ""], "arnumber": "7419765"}
