This type of architecture can significantly reduce the cost, power, size, and weight of electronics on future weapon delivery platforms. The Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is developing technology to support multimode radar requirements. These requirements include the detection and location of moving or stationary low radar cross section targets in heavy ground clutter and the classification and/or recognition of these targets. We address these requirements with commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products and the integration of several enabling technologies. The test bed radar includes a direct digital synthesizer (DDS) for frequency-diverse waveform generation, a flexible wideband transceiver for bandwidth extension and frequency translation, and an open architecture signal processor with embedded wideband analog-to-digital converters for real-time acquisition and processing. Efficient signal processing algorithms have been developed to demonstrate multimode radar capability.
