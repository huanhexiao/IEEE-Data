To guarantee real-time multiuser communications over a network, the selection of medium-access schemes is critical for avionics applications. In this paper, we briefly discuss the issues on high-speed multiple-access techniques and their applicability. Then we focus on the design and operation aspects of avionic optical fiber code-division multiple access (CDMA) networks. Some practical considerations on implementing such a CDMA network are also addressed and further improvement is pointed out. It is shown that avionic optical fiber CDMA networks can find a use in real-time avionic sensor data distribution, data exchange, and computer interconnects", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "21", "date_publication": "Jun 1999", "inspec": "6284677", "date": "Jun 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "15 - 21", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Jian-Guo Zhang"], "keywords": ["aircraft communication", "avionics", "broadband networks", "code division multiple access", "optical fibre LAN", "advanced aircraft", "airborne broadband communication", "avionic optical fiber CDMA networks", "computer interconnects", "data exchange", "high-capacity optical fiber communication", "high-speed optical fiber communication", "medium-access schemes selection", "network implementation", "real-time avionic sensor data distribution", "real-time multiuser communications", "systems integration technology", "Aerospace electronics", "Aircraft", "Broadband communication", "Computer networks", "Multiaccess communication", "Optical design", "Optical fiber communication", "Optical fiber sensors", "Optical fibers", "Optical sensors", ""], "arnumber": "769632"}
