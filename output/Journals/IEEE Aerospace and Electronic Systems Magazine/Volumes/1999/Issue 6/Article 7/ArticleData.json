In order to reuse the integration tests in the factory, the test conditions, test equipment, and test procedures need to be identical. Reusing the integration tests for factory testing takes additional effort at the beginning of the project but is cost effective in the long run", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "29", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "33", "date_publication": "Jun 1999", "inspec": "6284679", "date": "Jun 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "29 - 33", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["L.
