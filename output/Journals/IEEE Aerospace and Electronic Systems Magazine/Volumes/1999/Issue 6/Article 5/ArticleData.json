Until recently, most radar antennas were designed and tested in a clean antenna environment, i.e., there is no near field scattering from host structures or radome effects. However, these higher order effects are the matter of increasing concern with added performance demands in the ever-increasing jammer and clutter interference environments. We investigated the capabilities and limitations of currently available analysis techniques and computer codes for installed performance of airborne radar antenna systems. Then we developed an extended ray-optical technique that could predict total installed performance of airborne radar antenna systems, i.e., the near field scattering from aircraft structures and radome effects. The new analysis technique utilized a ray-tracing method in both airframe and radome simulation. Thus, it can efficiently predict the total installed performance of large radar antenna systems on an aircraft structure", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "38", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "42", "date_publication": "Jun 1999", "inspec": "6284681", "date": "Jun 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "38 - 42", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
