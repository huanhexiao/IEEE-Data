This philosophic approach to diagnostic testing is not new. It has been studied over the past 20 years under the visor of \u201cIntegrated Diagnostics\u201d, but it has yet to be truly implemented in a \u201creal life\u201d military diagnostic test environment. The mindset of Test Program Set design engineering, along with customer and contractor management alike, remains \u201ccomplete diagnostic testing based upon single catastrophic component failure modes\u201d. If we are to generate cost efficient Test Program Sets (TPSs) under reduced military budget constraints, this will have to change! The test engineer must be encouraged to use methodologies to speed up development time and decrease TPS run times. Using present technology, this is possible now, and as the technology matures, will become a truly viable approach in the future. For the purpose of this paper, the author relies heavily on his extensive US Navy Automatic Test Equipment (ATE) and Test Program Set (TPS) experience, as well as on previous studies performed on using BIT to fault diagnose Unit Under Test failures on US Naval Air weapon systems", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "14", "date_publication": "Dec 1999", "inspec": "6471470", "date": "Dec 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "12", "pages": "9 - 14", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["H.
