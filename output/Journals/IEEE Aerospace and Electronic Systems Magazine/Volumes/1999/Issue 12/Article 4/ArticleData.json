The objective of the program is to design, develop, and demonstrate an advanced electrical power generation and distribution system for a More-Electric Aircraft (MEA). The MEA emphasizes the use of electrical power in place of hydraulics, pneumatic, and mechanical power to optimize the performance and life cycle cost of the aircraft. This paper presents an overview of the MADMEL program and a top-level summary of the program results, development and test of major components to date. In Phase I and Phase II studies, the electrical load requirements were established and the electrical power system architecture was defined for both near-term (NT-year 1996) and far-term (FT-year 2003) MEA application. The detailed design and specification for the Electrical Power System (EPS), its interface with the Vehicle Management System, and the test set-up were developed under Phase III. Phase IV, fabrication and testing of the subsystem level hardware, has been completed. Overall system level integration and testing, Phase V, is scheduled to be completed by September 1999", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "Dec 1999", "inspec": "6471469", "date": "Dec 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "12", "pages": "3 - 8", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
