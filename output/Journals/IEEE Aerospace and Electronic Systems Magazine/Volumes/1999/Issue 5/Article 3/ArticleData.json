This system, called the Operationally Capable Lidar (OCL), was installed in a modified C-130 fuel pod. The OCL was designed to: (1) provide real-time, 3-D maps of wind fields between the aircraft and the ground; and (2) significantly improve airdrop accuracy from high altitudes. This paper briefly describes the OCL, the Precision Airdrop simulation (PADS) tool, and flight test activities, including the Precision Airdrop Integrated Demonstration.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "36", "date_publication": "May 1999", "inspec": "6267390", "date": "May 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "31 - 36", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
