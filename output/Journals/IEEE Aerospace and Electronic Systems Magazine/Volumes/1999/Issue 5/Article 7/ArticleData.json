Concurrent with technology advances, Ovonic NiMH batteries have established performance and commercial milestones in electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, as well as scooter, motorcycle and bicycle applications. As important as these advances, significant manufacturing cost reductions have also occurred which allow continued growth of NiMH technology. In this paper, advances in performance, applications and cost reduction are discussed with particular emphasis on the improved proprietary metal hydride and nickel hydroxide materials that make such advances possible", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "May 1999", "inspec": "6267388", "date": "May 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "17 - 23", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["S.
