It is designated for surveying building structures and works. The characteristic feature of this device is the possibility of obtaining sounding plane radio images featuring a high resolution attaining 1\u20262 cm. The main applications of this device includes the survey of building structures to reveal their heterogeneities and defects and the investigation of premises to detect bugging devices", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "May 1999", "inspec": "6267389", "date": "May 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "25 - 29", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["I.
