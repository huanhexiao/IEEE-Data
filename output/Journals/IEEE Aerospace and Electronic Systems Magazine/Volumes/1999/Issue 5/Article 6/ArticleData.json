Recently they were selected for the next generation deep-space missions, which need a converter that makes electricity from radioisotope heat. The AMTEC cell, being an electrochemical converter of heat to electricity, has no moving parts and is not limited to Carnot-cycle efficiency. However, its heat source and sink have to be near each other, so the challenge in AMTEC design is to minimize thermal losses and maximize electricity production. This required clever thermal designs. By 1991, high-temperature materials and computer modeling became available. The important AMTEC application was generating power from radioisotope heat in deep space missions. These spacecraft power needs had previously been supplied by inefficient thermoelectric converters", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "43", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "46", "date_publication": "May 1999", "inspec": "6267392", "date": "May 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "43 - 46", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["H.
