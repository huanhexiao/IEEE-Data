The proposed microsystem is based on a multichip module containing three equal channels for the three components of the magnetic field measurement, a microprocessor and a memory. Each single-chip channel detects the magnetic field, converts it into the digital domain and delivers the result to the microprocessor by means of an on-chip serial interface. The single-chip channel, fabricated in a 0.8 \u03bcm CMOS technology, is sensitive to magnetic fields ranging from -200 mT to +200 mT, achieving 12 bits of resolution and 11 bits of linearity.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "43", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "46", "date_publication": "Sept. 1999", "inspec": "6385232", "date": "Sept. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "43 - 46", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
