Pilot training time represents a significant cost to aircraft operators, and the importance of human factors considerations in safety has been highlighted by the FAA, who notes that human error is a cause in roughly 70% of aircraft accidents. These concerns have led to a new focus on human-centered design, which seeks to define system functionality based on the user's perspective rather than that of the designer. We have used the principles of user-centered design to develop a new autoflight system concept that integrates the autopilot and flight management system functions into a single user interface that most pilots can learn to use within about fifteen minutes. This is in contrast to the weeks required to learn a typical flight management system", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "6", "date_publication": "Sep 1999", "inspec": "6385227", "date": "Sep 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "3 - 6", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["V.
