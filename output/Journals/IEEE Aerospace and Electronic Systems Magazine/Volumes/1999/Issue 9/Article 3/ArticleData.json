Long-life batteries are the key to achieving a low life-cycle cost for the electric vehicles that will help solve the air-pollution problem in our cities. New ways of making batteries last longer are discussed", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "21", "date_publication": "Sep 1999", "inspec": "6385229", "date": "Sep 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "19 - 21", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["H.
