It features many advanced functions such as: satellite video, Internet access, virtual navigation, remote vehicle diagnostics and control, games, mobile office, automotive web site, and customized real-time stock quotes and sports scores. These features are enabled by an integrated planar antenna that is capable of multiple satellite reception, a client-server network architecture, and unique human-vehicle-interfaces such as color reconfigurable head-up and head-down displays, steering wheel controls, voice recognition, text-to-speech, and large touch screen active matrix liquid crystal displays (LCDs). The software applications are written in Java, using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to reduce the complexity and cost of the source code", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "32", "date_publication": "Sep 1999", "inspec": "6385230", "date": "Sep 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "27 - 32", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
