Due to the attractive performance characteristics, lithium-ion batteries have been identified as the battery chemistry of choice for a number of future applications, including Mars rovers and landers. The Mars 2001 Lander (Mars Surveyor Program MSP 01) will be one of the first missions which will utilize lithium-ion technology. This application will require two lithium-ion batteries, each being 28 V (eight cells), 25 Ah and 8 kg. In addition to the requirement of being able to supply at least 200 cycles and 90 days of operation on the surface of Mars, the battery must be capable of operation (both charge and discharge) at temperatures as low as -20\u00b0C. To assess the viability of lithium-ion cells for these applications, a number of performance characterization tests have been performed, including: assessing the room temperature cycle life, low temperature cycle life (-20\u00b0C), rate capability as a function of temperature, pulse capability, self-discharge and storage characteristics, as well as mission profile capability. This paper describes the Mars 2001 Lander mission battery requirements and contains results of the cell testing conducted to-date in support of the mission,", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "36", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "42", "date_publication": "Nov 1999", "inspec": "6455483", "date": "Nov 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "11", "pages": "36 - 42", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
