Will these systems operate reliably after midnight, January 1, 2000, or will problems associated with date calculations cause failures that adversely affect users? This question has caused organizations to identify their critical systems, test these systems for Y2K problems, and take corrective action where necessary to ensure Y2K readiness. This paper examines various technical and management issues that Southwest Research Institute has dealt with in solving these problems", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "9", "date_publication": "Nov 1999", "inspec": "6463639", "date": "Nov 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "11", "pages": "3 - 9", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["W.
