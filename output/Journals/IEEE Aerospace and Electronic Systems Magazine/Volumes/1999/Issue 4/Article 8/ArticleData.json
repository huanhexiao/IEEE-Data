Compared with an existing modulation scheme of MIL-STD-1773 avionics data buses, the proposed techniques can be effectively used to overcome the difficulty in recognizing the correct operation states of an active transmitter at the output of optical receivers. The feasibility of proposed modulation schemes are discussed, and their performance is also evaluated", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "38", "date_publication": "Apr 1999", "inspec": "6229087", "date": "Apr 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "4", "pages": "31 - 38", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Jian-Guo Zhang"], "keywords": ["data communication equipment", "military avionics", "military standards", "optical fibre networks", "phase coding", "pulse amplitude modulation", "pulse width modulation", "system buses", "Amplitude-Distinguished Sync Field", "Beginning-Stopping Flags", "Extended Manchester II Bi-Phase Coding", "Four-ary PWM", "MIL-STD-1773 avionics data buses", "Two-ary Message PWM", "Two-ary PWM", "Two-ary Sync PAM", "active transmitter", "correct operation states", "military avionics", "modulation techniques", "optical fiber data bus", "optical receiver output", "partial Trilevel Manchester II Bi-Phase Coding", "Aerospace electronics", "Amplitude modulation", "Data buses", "Modulation coding", "Optical fibers", "Optical pulses", "Optical receivers", "Optical transmitters", "Pulse width modulation", "Space vector pulse width modulation", ""], "arnumber": "756081"}
