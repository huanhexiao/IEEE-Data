CPA-Cost and Performance Analysis-addresses the fourth of these four issues. CPA is a methodology that joins activity based cost estimation with performance-based analysis of physical protection systems. CPA offers system managers an approach that supports both tactical decision making and strategic planning. Current exploratory applications of the CPA methodology address analysis of alternative conceptual designs. Hypothetical data is used to illustrate this process", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "13", "date_publication": "Apr 1999", "inspec": "6222412", "date": "Apr 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "4", "pages": "9 - 13", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
