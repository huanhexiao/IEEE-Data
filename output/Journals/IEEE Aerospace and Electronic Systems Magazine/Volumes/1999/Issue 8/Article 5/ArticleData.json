This consumer electronic equipment is often referred to as \u201cthe leading edge of technology\u201d. Unfortunately, that same equipment that is the \u201cleading edge\u201d of consumer electronics, often stalls to feel like the \u201cbleeding edge\u201d when you try to integrate it into IFE systems for today's modern aircraft. Unlike Avionics Systems, the technologies behind IFE equipment are not usually mature before they are integrated into the aircraft. What may work well in a home environment, may not work well at all in the aircraft environment. Often this problem results in last minute redesign in an effort to make the equipment function as intended on the aircraft. Both the FAA and the aircraft manufacturer impose many requirements on the suppliers and products of IFE. Systems need to be designed for the aircraft environment. Many variations on IFE Systems have forced the creation of new standards for integration into commercial aircraft. Power, cooling, and EMC issues are becoming more of a concern as we move to fill aircraft implementations. Beyond the technical evaluations and lab/aircraft testing, one key component is customer satisfaction. This paper will cover some of the methods and tools we use to get IFE from wishlist to reality", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "37", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "43", "date_publication": "Aug 1999", "inspec": "6348640", "date": "Aug 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "37 - 43", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
