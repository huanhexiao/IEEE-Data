If not, you soon will, IEEE 1394, or Firewire, is an up-and-coming electronics industry standard that will soon be in wide use for interconnecting a massive variety of electronic equipment. It will be used for connecting CD-ROMs and scanners to computers, and it will be used for connecting VCRs, DVDs and satellite dishes to digital televisions. How does this affect Test & Measurement? This paper discusses Firewire, along with it's lower-end companion, USE, and how they can and will be utilized in T&M; applications to replace T&M; specific technologies, such as IEEE 488, and MXI. The advantages-and disadvantages-of these new technologies are discussed along with what the Test & Measurement industry should do to support these new technologies.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "Aug 1999", "inspec": "6348637", "date": "Aug 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "21 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["L.
