At the more detailed, lower levels, however, subtle underlying differences were identified that lend insight into their decisions. The preliminary experimental results indicate that situation awareness was improved when information was shared between the cockpit and the ground. Pilots' traffic situation awareness improved when traffic information was displayed; controllers' weather situation awareness improved when weather information was displayed. Operational errors were reduced in the process. Pilots and controllers also exhibited behavioral changes. When information was shared, controllers provided more frequent weather advisories to pilots. Pilots and controllers were more likely to suggest preferred route amendment alternatives to their counterparts, and re-route negotiation increased in the process. Based on these preliminary results, it appears that shared information between flight crews and air traffic controllers may be beneficial in terms of improved situation awareness and the behaviors it appears to foster", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "Aug 1999", "inspec": "6348638", "date": "Aug 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "25 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
