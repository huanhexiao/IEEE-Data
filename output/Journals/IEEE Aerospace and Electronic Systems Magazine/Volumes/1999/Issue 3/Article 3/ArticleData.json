Hardware components are becoming obsolete much sooner while weapons system lifetimes are increasing, We must identify more cost-effective solutions to engineering and reengineering these subsystems. Verifying and validating weapons systems are two of the most costly parts of either engineering process. Traditionally, hardware validation and verification is done by simulation and testing, In the past few years, math- and logic-based formal methods tools have begun to scale up to and be applied successfully to real-world problems. Incorporating formal verification methods into engineering and reengineering processes will cost-effectively and significantly improve the level of trust and the quality of our weapons systems. Formal methods are especially well suited for redesigning current weapon systems which have become unsupportable due to component obsolescence because they help minimize the astronomical costs of rigorously reverifying the reengineered components. We believe that formal methods are an important tool for effective engineering of future weapon systems", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "36", "date_publication": "Mar 1999", "inspec": "6197967", "date": "Mar 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "31 - 36", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["F.
