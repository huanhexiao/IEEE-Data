However, a number of technical challenges remain. Specifically, the development and qualification of a system capable of withstanding the harsh environmental conditions encountered during normal and abnormal zones of operation. This paper focuses on the environmental extremes that the Eagle-Picher lithium-ion system has tested to date. Emphasis is placed on low temperature performance, high temperature performance, power capability, and cycle life at these extremes. Other areas including safety and environmental issues have also been investigated", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "37", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "40", "date_publication": "Mar 1999", "inspec": "6197968", "date": "Mar 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "37 - 40", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
