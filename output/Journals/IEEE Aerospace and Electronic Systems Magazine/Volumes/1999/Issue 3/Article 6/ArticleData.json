This task is mostly reduced to the problem of detecting moving objects evaluating image sequences of a monocular camera. An essential problem of this monocular approach is its inability to measure the 3D-size and 3D-position of objects reliably, as object size and velocity are estimated within the 2D-image plane. To include 3D-information about the scene an approach using a second camera is proposed in this paper which combines the evaluation of the measurement data of the two cameras using an efficient 3D-scene model. Here, two cameras are used with an overlapping field of view, which represents an installation often used in existing video surveillance applications. It is shown that using the combined evaluation of the two cameras, the false detection rate in the case of moving shadows, leaves, birds and insects or blindings can be further reduced compared to a pure monocular evaluation", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "Mar 1999", "inspec": "6197965", "date": "Mar 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "13 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
