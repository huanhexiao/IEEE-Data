Typical interest areas include equipment enclosures, transducers and high-tech microwave modules. New performance levels are feasible due to improved surface quality, stability, reduction of seam widths or the use of sophisticated materials. The stepwise procedure points out attractive solutions for challenging airborne, maritime or space sensor platform environments. A thorough understanding of manufacturability judgement and knowledge about current milling, welding and coating processes is essential as well as the earliest application of the formulated principle", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "33", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "35", "date_publication": "Feb 1999", "inspec": "6177927", "date": "Feb 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "33 - 35", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["H.
