Some electronic devices push video signals directly to the brain but the device presented in this paper uses a sensitive and ready sensorial system: the auditory system. This article presents a low cost electronic device that enables the blind to distinguish the color and distance of objects. The project was first published in the UK and that system with the intensity of musical notes proportional to the brightness has proven to be annoying as the musical notes sound uninterrupted. In order to solve this problem, a new system for brightness perception was designed so a brief musical note is sounded when the sensor detects an increase of brightness and another brief musical note, one octave below, is sounded when the sensor detects a decrease in brightness", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "6", "date_publication": "Feb 1999", "inspec": "6177922", "date": "Feb 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "4 - 6", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
