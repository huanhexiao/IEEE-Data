The system has auxiliary time synchronizing equipment attached to existing STE and CSE, where frequency and time are separately synchronized, and which enables us to partially time-synchronize an SDH network or to introduce a time synchronous system locally. Experimental time synchronizing devices using a data communication channel (DCC) in the section overhead (SOH) showed potentially satisfactory performance; synchronization errors of a 4-link system are of the order of sub-microseconds", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "Feb 1999", "inspec": "6177925", "date": "Feb 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "19 - 28", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Y.
