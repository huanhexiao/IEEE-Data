Increasingly sophisticated enemy defenses require that fire control information be derived from highly maneuverable aircraft trajectories rather than traditional straight-and-level flight. In addition, target area aspect information is needed to determine optimal attack approaches. These imaging and targeting conditions impose severe performance requirements on the sensor aircraft motion compensation system (MCS), and dictate the need for sophisticated algorithms to counteract ECM threats.
