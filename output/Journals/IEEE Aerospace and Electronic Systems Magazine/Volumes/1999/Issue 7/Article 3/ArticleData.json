While the hardware interfaces have been well defined for some time, the software is still struggling. Industry hype infers that integrating VXI resources is just a \u201cplug and play\u201d affair that anyone should be able to do. This paper explores some of the pitfalls of integrating VXI resources from different (and sometimes the same) suppliers that make this more challenging than you might think", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "Jul 1999", "inspec": "6302528", "date": "Jul 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "9 - 12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
