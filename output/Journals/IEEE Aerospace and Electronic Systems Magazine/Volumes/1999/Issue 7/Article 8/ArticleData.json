Many testers still rely on computers designed and manufactured in the early 1980's. This includes systems using embedded controllers. Year 2000 problems can surface in computer operating systems, compilers, test programs, and in embedded systems. Until the impact of the Y2K \u201cbug\u201d is addressed, the risk of test program failure is unknown in most legacy automatic test systems. Problems may include embedded controllers in proprietary designs, old operating systems, and unique test program code. This paper will address the potential problem areas in automatic testing, and suggest an approach for determining the best course of action. In order to evaluate the impact, a complete systems inventory must be done to identify all potential sources of problems. Little attention has been paid to the legacy automated test systems and the potential impact of the Y2K problem on such systems. Although newer systems are less likely to be affected, no one can be sure until a complete inventory and test has been accomplished", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "5", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "Jul 1999", "inspec": "6302527", "date": "Jul 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "5 - 8", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["W.
