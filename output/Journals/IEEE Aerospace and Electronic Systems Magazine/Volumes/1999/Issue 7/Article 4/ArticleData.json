Because Light Emitting Diodes (LED's) have better temperature performance and require less complex driver circuits than laser diodes, the former is normally chosen as an optical source in the severe aircraft environment at present. In this case, optical power budget becomes a critical factor which can significantly limit the number of terminals in a data bus. To effectively solve this problem while maintaining a high reliability, we present several configurations of all-active couplers and hybrid passive/active couplers for avionics optical fiber data buses using PIN photodiodes and LED's. The system design is also described, which incorporates a modulation scheme called partial trilevel Manchester II bi-phase coding", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "33", "date_publication": "Jul 1999", "inspec": "6302532", "date": "Jul 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "27 - 33", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Jian-Guo Zhang", "Yu-De Ni", "Zheng Li"], "keywords": ["aircraft computers", "command and control systems", "integrated optoelectronics", "light emitting diodes", "military avionics", "military standards", "optical backplanes", "optical fibre LAN", "optical fibre couplers", "p-i-n photodiodes", "system buses", "LED", "MIL-STD-1773", "PIN photodiodes", "active-coupler configurations", "all-active couplers", "command and control communications", "high reliability", "hybrid passive/active couplers", "military avionics", "modulation scheme", "optical fiber data buses", "optical power budget", "partial trilevel Manchester II bi-phase coding", "star topology", "Aerospace electronics", "Data buses", "Diode lasers", "Driver circuits", "Light emitting diodes", "Military aircraft", "Optical fiber couplers", "Optical fibers", "Stimulated emission", "Temperature", ""], "arnumber": "774900"}
