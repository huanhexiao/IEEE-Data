The use of incoherent optical CDMA (IO-CDMA) can result in lower complexity and more reliable implementation than that of the coherent version, so this makes IO-CDMA more adequate for operation in the severe aircraft environment. When FOOCs are used in the IO-CDMA systems, the peaks of all the cross-correlation functions and all the sidelobes of any auto-correlation function are then limited to \u201c1\u201d (i.e., the minimum correlation constraint for incoherent optical processing) in fully asynchronous transmissions. Moreover, proposed systems can effectively support multi-rate and variable-rate data communications with no violation of the minimum correlation constraint and no change of IO-CDMA encoders/decoders. This characteristic can be used to improve the system flexibility and availability. A basic experiment is also demonstrated to verify the characteristics of FOOCs", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "35", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "42", "date_publication": "Jul 1999", "inspec": "6302533", "date": "Jul 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "35 - 42", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Jian-Guo Zhang"], "keywords": ["aircraft computers", "code division multiple access", "codes", "command and control systems", "military avionics", "optical backplanes", "optical correlation", "optical fibre LAN", "system buses", "airborne optical fiber asynchronous CDMA system", "airborne real-time communication services", "auto-correlation function", "avionics data buses", "computer interconnects", "cross-correlation functions", "fully optical orthogonal codes", "incoherent optical CDMA", "incoherent optical processing", "military aircraft", "minimum correlation constraint", "real-time avionic data distribution", "Aerospace electronics", "Aircraft", "High speed optical techniques", "Multiaccess communication", "Optical fibers", "Optical interconnections", "Optical sensors", "Optical signal processing", "Optical transmitters", "Real time systems", ""], "arnumber": "774901"}
