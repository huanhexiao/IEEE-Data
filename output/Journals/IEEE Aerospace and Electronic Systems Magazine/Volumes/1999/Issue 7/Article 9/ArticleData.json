Its range resolution is decided by the signal frequency bandwidth. This paper proposes an interpolation algorithm based on fast Fourier transform to improve the accuracy of range estimation without increasing the frequency bandwidth. The algorithm application in practice is described. The simulation result of estimation accuracy is also given", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "45", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "47", "date_publication": "Jul 1999", "inspec": "6302534", "date": "Jul 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "45 - 47", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Wang Wei", "Peng Yingning"], "keywords": ["FM radar", "fast Fourier transforms", "interpolation", "radar detection", "radar resolution", "spectral analysis", "estimation accuracy", "fast Fourier transform", "improved range estimation", "interpolation algorithm", "linear frequency modulated radar", "range resolution", "signal frequency bandwidth", "spectral analysis", "Airplanes", "Bandwidth", "Chirp modulation", "Detectors", "Equations", "Fast Fourier transforms", "Frequency estimation", "Frequency modulation", "Interpolation", "Radar detection", ""], "arnumber": "774903"}
