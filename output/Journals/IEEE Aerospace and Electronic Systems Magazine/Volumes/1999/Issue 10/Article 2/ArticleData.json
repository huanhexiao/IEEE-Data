External projects take staff time and the curriculum continues to threaten youngsters with de-focused mathematics. The computer age has reduced the interest in experimental research, and the continuation of science in the systems level may be in danger", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "35", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "38", "date_publication": "Oct 1999", "inspec": "6434258", "date": "Oct 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "35 - 38", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
