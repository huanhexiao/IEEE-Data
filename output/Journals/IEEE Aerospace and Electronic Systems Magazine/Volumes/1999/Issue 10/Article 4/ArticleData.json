That is, technology must change, must improve, to accommodate billions more people and to lift the standard of living. Engineers, receiving feedback from the market and regulated wisely in the public interest, do much of the improving. Thus, the chance for improving Earth's environment hinges on engineers, and therefore their social context and technical vision. First, I will explain what I mean by the unchanging human brain. Then I will exemplify technical change in energy and agriculture in the cardinal directions it must go", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "Oct 1999", "inspec": "6434254", "date": "Oct 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "3 - 8", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
