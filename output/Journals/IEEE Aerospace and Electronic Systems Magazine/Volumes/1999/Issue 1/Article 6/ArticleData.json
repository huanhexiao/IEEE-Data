We use typical efficiencies of today's available CHP technologies to estimate the technical potential for the frozen technology case. We find that if manufacturers in 1994 had self-generated all their steam and electric needs with existing cost-effective CHP technologies, they could have reduced carbon equivalent (=12/44 carbon dioxide) emissions by up to 30 million metric tons of carbon (MtC) or nearly 20 percent, and energy use by nearly an Exajoule (EJ). With growth in manufacturing and expected improvements in CHP technologies, this technical potential could be much larger. However, without environmental regulatory reform and innovation-oriented utility restructuring policies, actual CHP installed by US manufacturers could fall far short", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "7", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "Jan 1999", "inspec": "6137647", "date": "Jan 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "7 - 12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["T.
