Concurrent engineering will be essential to integrate the electronic, structure, and thermal design. Design methodologies are in work to manage all power, grounding and shielding concerns. The MFS approach offers significant savings in mass and volume and supports the \u201cfaster-better-cheaper\u201d philosophy in new spacecraft programs. The technology will be demonstrated as an experiment on the New Millenium Program Deep Space 1 (DS 1) mission", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "Jan 1999", "inspec": "6137648", "date": "Jan 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "13 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
