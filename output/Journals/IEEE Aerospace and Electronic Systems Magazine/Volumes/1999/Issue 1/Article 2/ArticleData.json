This type of accident is referred to as Controlled Flight Into Terrain (CFIT). Statistics show that introduction of the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) into the scheduled air carrier turbojet fleet has been accompanied by a dramatic drop in the frequency of CFIT accidents. Training aids, videos, checklists, and procedural recommendations have also been produced to aid in CFIT risk reduction. Despite these actions, CFIT worldwide losses continue. Common characteristics of these continued accidents are a lack of installed GPWS or shortcomings of the current GPWS detection algorithms. The Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning Systems have been developed to address these shortcomings, and to provide enhanced situational awareness to the pilots such that CFIT accidents can become a thing of the past", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "Jan 1999", "inspec": "6137649", "date": "Jan 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "19 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["B.
