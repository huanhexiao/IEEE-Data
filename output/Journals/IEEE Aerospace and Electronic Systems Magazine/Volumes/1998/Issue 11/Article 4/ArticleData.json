The use of B-IDAIENs can improve communication efficiency, flexibility, and capacity compared with using present avionics data buses. To implement B-IDAIENs the supporting techniques, such as wavelength-division multiplexing/wavelength-division multiple access and optical Benes network, are considered. Related optical components are also discussed. It is expected that the proposed B-IDAIENs can efficiently provide real-time video and voice communications, high/low speed data transmissions, parallel communications, and other time-critical services such as urgent signals from warning receivers", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "35", "date_publication": "Nov 1998", "inspec": "6093240", "date": "Nov 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "11", "pages": "31 - 35", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Jian-Guo Zhang"], "keywords": ["B-ISDN", "military aircraft", "military avionics", "multi-access systems", "optical fibre networks", "wavelength division multiplexing", "B-IDAIEN", "avionics applications", "broadband integrated digital information exchange networks", "communication efficiency", "data transmissions", "optical Benes network", "parallel communications", "real-time video", "time-critical services", "voice communications", "warning receivers", "wavelength-division multiple access", "wavelength-division multiplexing", "Aerospace electronics", "Aircraft", "Data buses", "Flat panel displays", "Optical devices", "Optical receivers", "Three dimensional displays", "Time factors", "Vehicles", "Wavelength division multiplexing", ""], "arnumber": "730621"}
