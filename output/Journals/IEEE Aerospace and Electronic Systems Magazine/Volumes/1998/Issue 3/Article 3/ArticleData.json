A communications architecture is proposed which is based upon a switched network technology from the telecommunications area asynchronous transfer mode (ATM). However, the major step of migrating all existing avionics equipment into an ATM compliant form is avoided by the process of \"emulating\" a current avionics data bus such as MIL-STD-1553B over an ATM network. This allows current 1553 subsystems to co-exist with ATM compliant equipment on a single physical ATM network.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "34", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "39", "date_publication": "March 1998", "inspec": "5896716", "date": "March 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "34 - 39", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
