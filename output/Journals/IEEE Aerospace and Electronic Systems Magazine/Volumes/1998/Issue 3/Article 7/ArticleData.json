Techniques employed to efficiently implement each step of the signal processing are discussed. An overall throughput of 3.15 GFLOPS and processing efficiency of 48% has been achieved, indicating that embedded high performance computers can deliver a significant percentage of their advertised peak throughput under real system constraints", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "31", "date_publication": "Mar 1998", "inspec": "5896714", "date": "Mar 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "15 - 31", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
