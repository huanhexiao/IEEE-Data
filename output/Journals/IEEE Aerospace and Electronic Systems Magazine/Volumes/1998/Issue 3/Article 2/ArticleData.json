In the 1980s, a great deal of energy was expended in an attempt to create a broad market of security-enhanced systems. This market, however, did not develop, and most computer systems today include only rudimentary security mechanisms. New technologies, such as extensible systems and security wrappers, hold promise to reintroduce security as an effective and ubiquitous system service.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "32", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "33", "date_publication": "March 1998", "inspec": "5896715", "date": "March 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "32 - 33", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["L.
