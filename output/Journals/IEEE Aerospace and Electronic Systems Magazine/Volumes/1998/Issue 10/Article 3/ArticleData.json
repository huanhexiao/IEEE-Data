Two optical modulation techniques are proposed for avionics data buses, and they can be used to efficiently solve the problems associated with the fast identification of correct operation states for optical transmitters while maintaining less complexity of transceivers. The implementation of the proposed techniques is discussed. We also deal with the selection of optical devices and fibers to improve the reliability and power budget of optical fiber avionics data buses. Furthermore, some future improvements on avionics data bus systems are pointed out", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "32", "date_publication": "Oct 1998", "inspec": "6049784", "date": "Oct 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "25 - 32", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Jian-Guo Zhang"], "keywords": ["aircraft computers", "military avionics", "military standards", "optical fibre LAN", "optical modulation", "optical transmitters", "pulse width modulation", "system buses", "MIL-STD-1553B", "MIL-STD-1773", "correct operation states", "design issues", "fast identification", "less transceiver complexity", "optical fiber avionics data buses", "optical modulation techniques", "optical network components", "optical transmitters", "partial trilevel Manchester II bi-phase coding", "power budget", "pseudo-four-ary PWM", "reliability", "Aerospace electronics", "Data buses", "Maintenance", "Optical design", "Optical devices", "Optical fiber devices", "Optical fibers", "Optical modulation", "Optical transmitters", "Transceivers", ""], "arnumber": "722417"}
