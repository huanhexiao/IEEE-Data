Such constraints frequently include form, fit, and functional replacement specifications, as well as power and electrical performance restrictions. This paper describes a technology insertion program undertaken with the goal of replacing the 30-year-old azimuth indicator display of a radar warning receiver system. This necessitated the use of electroluminescent (EL) display technology to replace the analog cathode ray tube display currently used in the system. Because of the prohibitively high cost of aircraft wiring modifications, the replacement display was required to be completely form, fit, and functionally equivalent to its replacement. The form, fit, and functional equivalency requirement imposed the following system constraints: (1) power consumption of less than 10 Watts; (2) the need to maintain the same stroke-deflection current electrical interface; and (3) the need to meet the maintenance and repair budget of the existing display unit. Additional requirements included night-vision compatibility and full sunlight readability. The display was also required to be MIL-STD-1553 Remote Terminal communication capable. All requirements posed a challenging technology insertion problem to program personnel. The case study described in this paper illustrates the approach to meeting the particular requirements of this technology insertion program", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "33", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "37", "date_publication": "Oct 1998", "inspec": "6049785", "date": "Oct 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "33 - 37", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["B.
