Once this is implemented, civil aviation will be totally vulnerable to terrorist jamming of the GPS signals over wide earth areas with widespread disruption of air traffic and potential disasters. It has become apparent that the use of GPS/GNSS is complex and expensive for the required civil aviation functions. It is clear that a different system form is needed for civil aviation, a redundant satellite/ground based system that will prevent it from being a jamming target while providing ATC surveillance, area navigation, collision warning/avoidance, high-speed data link and Category I landing guidance globally, plus precision Category III guidance in the terminal areas as needed. Such a system will be described", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Oct 1998", "inspec": "6049782", "date": "Oct 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "9 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
