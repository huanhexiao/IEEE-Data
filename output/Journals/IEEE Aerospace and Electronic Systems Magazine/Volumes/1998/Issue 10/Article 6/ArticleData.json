This arbitrary decision is not borne out by Maxwell's theories or by any test that might prove that EM energy actually travels in a continuum of velocities. The second postulate as stated by Einstein does not deserve the status of a postulate, as it is at once overly restrictive and ultimately phenomenological-the nature of c is based on experimental measurement rather than on analysis of first principles. The radiation continuum model's (RCM) modified second postulate, however, says nothing about the actual propagation of EM energy, but only of the relative speed with which it must interact with matter to be detected. Utilizing this modified light principle we obtain an intuitive Galilean form invariance for Maxwell's equations. RCM places no upper limit on attainable velocities, and allows for the possibility of communications between humans or particles at speeds far in excess of c. This precludes many of the compatibility problems between the highly successful quantum mechanics and relativity theory", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "Oct 1998", "inspec": "6057407", "date": "Oct 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "3 - 8", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
