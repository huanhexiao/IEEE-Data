Unlike early designs from the 1970s and 1980s, simple constructions with phase and attenuation recording are now possible, if optimal frequencies are selected. At K-band, most quality impairments can be detected from basic group delay measurements, e.g., knots or insect holes smaller than 5 mm are observable. Impairments can be detected from a non-parallel viewing direction", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "34", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "35", "date_publication": "Feb 1998", "inspec": "5866012", "date": "Feb 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "34 - 35", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
