The complex airwake velocity field associated with the ship and aircraft interface directly affects the pilot's ability to control the aircraft during takeoff, approach, hover, landing, and deck operations. Dynamic Interface (DI) testing is performed to define safe aircraft operational envelopes; however, not all conditions can be realized within the limited test period and asset/condition availability. In addition, exact wind conditions that affect the aircraft cannot be measured with existing wind sensors. These sensors measure wind in the ship's mast area which does not represent the wind flow field encountered by the aircraft. A means of non-intrusively measuring the appropriate wind data is required. This paper presents an overview of the unique aspects of the ship/aircraft interface, the overall naval DI environment and the sensor requirements for measuring this complex environment", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "26", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "33", "date_publication": "Feb 1998", "inspec": "5859145", "date": "Feb 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "26 - 33", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
