Yet this aspect of relativity has never been tested directly, due to the negligible size of the effect when applied to most situations. However, as the Earth orbits the Sun, any two stars located out of the plane of the ecliptic will appear to change their angle of separation as viewed during three-month intervals. This is due to the fact that at one instant the motion of the Earth lies in the same direction as a line joining the two stars, while three months later the Earth's motion is perpendicular to that line. At a velocity of 30 km/sec, the expected length contraction would be approximately 18 micro-arcseconds (\u03bcas) per degree of separation. The Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) promises a resolution of /spl plusmn/1 \u03bcas in a field of view of one degree. Special relativity claims that this level of precision has no meaning, or only limited operational meaning, as it is smaller than the anticipated seasonal Lorentz contraction effects. Either, as the author believes, this level of precision is attainable, and special relativity is completely invalid, or the promised sensitivity level cannot be achieved without compensating for length contraction as well as aberration in published star charts.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "7", "date_publication": "Sept. 1998", "inspec": "6042674", "date": "Sept. 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "3 - 7", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
