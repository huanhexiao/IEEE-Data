This paper details the multi-computer approach used in the VXI-based system that CACI developed for the Air Force. The system, the Engine Test/Trim Automated System II (ETTAS II) is designed to test: all Air Force jet engines. The paper discusses how to integrate multiple computers in a VXI-based system, including discussions on: setting up the computers; selecting register-based versus message-based computers; setting up and using shared-memory; defining and separating tasks for each computer. The shared memory discussion talks about different ways to structure the shared memory, including setting up a system-level \u201cCurrent-Value Table\u201d (CVT) for all instruments, as well as how other devices, including another computer can access the shared memory space. The paper shows how Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) software products NI-VXI, LabVIEW, and NI-VISA (National Instruments) can be used to satisfy all these requirements. The paper shows how the multi-computer approach can be cost-effective in many cases", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "21", "date_publication": "Sep 1998", "inspec": "6042676", "date": "Sep 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "17 - 21", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
