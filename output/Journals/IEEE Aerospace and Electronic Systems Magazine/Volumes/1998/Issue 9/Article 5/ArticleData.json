A new recurrent neural network with time-delayed inputs and output feedback is used for the modeling of angle tracking systems, with emphasis on the neural network architecture, principles and algorithms. The neural network controller with modeling units for angle tracking is designed by using TMS320C25 processors. For time and size requirements, limited precision technology and look-up table technology are used in the design of the hardware and software systems. Given a set of input commands, the network is trained to control the system within the constraints imposed by actuators. The results show that the proposed networks are able to model the angle tracking system through learning without separate consideration of the non-linearity of actuators", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "Sep 1998", "inspec": "6042678", "date": "Sep 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "27 - 29", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["He Mingyi", "Jiang Hailin", "Wei Jiang", "Li Yong", "Yang Xiangyu", "Li Jun"], "keywords": ["aircraft control", "control nonlinearities", "delays", "feedback", "learning (artificial intelligence)", "missile guidance", "neural nets", "target tracking", "TMS320C25 processors", "actuator", "aircraft", "angle", "angle tracking system", "angle tracking systems", "flight control system", "learning", "limited precision technology", "look-up table technology", "missile guided systems", "neural network modeling", "nonlinearity", "output feedback", "position", "rate", "recurrent neural network", "target-tracking", "time-delayed inputs", "Actuators", "Aerospace control", "Aircraft", "Computer architecture", "Missiles", "Neural networks", "Output feedback", "Recurrent neural networks", "Table lookup", "Target tracking", ""], "arnumber": "715536"}
