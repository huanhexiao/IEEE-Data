This effect causes ambiguities in target identification and track coordinate registration. A pattern classification approach is proposed for associating tracks. Neural networks and statistical methods are applied to combine track affinities and associate pairs of tracks. The proposed approach provides a practical and efficient way of dealing with multiple track association when the number of targets is large and optimal.
