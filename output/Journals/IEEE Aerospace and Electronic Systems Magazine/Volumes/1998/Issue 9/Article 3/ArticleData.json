By providing the soldier with a high energy density source and a lightweight compact battery charger, the burden imposed by rechargeable batteries in the forward field can be minimized. Zinc-air batteries have the potential for meeting the energy demands of forward battlefield charging. They are attitude insensitive, have a high specific energy and are inherently inexpensive, lightweight and safe.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "36", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "38", "date_publication": "Sept. 1998", "inspec": "6042680", "date": "Sept. 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "36 - 38", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["T.
