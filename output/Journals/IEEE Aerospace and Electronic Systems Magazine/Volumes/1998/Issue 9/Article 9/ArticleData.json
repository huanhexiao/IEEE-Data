These breadboard modules are equipped with built-in VXI bus interface circuitry and a breadboard area for creating a design to suit your test needs. A prime example for the use of this capability was demonstrated on a recent radar system test bench created to test many unique Units Under Test (UUTs) previously tested on separate test benches. A single breadboard module design replaced the dedicated interface and control hardware within the many test benches and test fixtures previously used to test the individual UUTs. This paper presents some design considerations and techniques implemented as part of this VXI breadboard module that can be useful when creating a VXI breadboard design. It also addresses the inherent built-in test capabilities provided by the module in conjunction with the techniques presented in the paper", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "43", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "47", "date_publication": "Sep 1998", "inspec": "6042682", "date": "Sep 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "43 - 47", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["B.
