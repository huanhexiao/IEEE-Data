The Aircraft Stores Interface Manual (ASIM) Program Office found that maintaining a staff for paper updates was no longer feasible and was tasked by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Air Armament Working Party (AAWP) to digitize the ASIM manuals. Converting this information from paper to electronic media presented several challenges which are discussed.
