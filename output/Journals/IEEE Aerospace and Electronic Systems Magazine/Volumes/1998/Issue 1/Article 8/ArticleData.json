The author believes there are many reasons. Some of these represent accidental and some essential problems. Most are part of a general issue of quality in the software products. Most problems that make it more difficult to apply testing techniques are part of a larger problem which make them more cost-effective to produce high quality software. The author presents a list of reasons industry does not use the highly advanced, and in some cases, highly developed software testing techniques that are available. The problems are divided into three broad categories: problems in industry; problems in academic research and education; and problems in the interface between the two", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "6", "date_publication": "Jan 1998", "inspec": "5896712", "date": "Jan 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "3 - 6", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
