An experiment is under construction to compare electric field and electromagnetic transmission VOP. Since magnetic fields in electric field transmission will be parallel to the direction of transmission rather than at right angles, there is reason to expect that electric field transmissions will have infinite VOP", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "5", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "Jan 1998", "inspec": "5838599", "date": "Jan 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "5 - 10", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["H.
