It also provides the potential to classify aircraft initially from observed takeoff data, which would be helpful in interdiction efforts. This paper discusses the radar signal components and signal processing techniques required to accomplish this capability. An actual takeoff, observed by SRI International's Wide Aperture Research Facility (WARF), illustrates how the range-Doppler display plays an important role in developing and automating this capability. The ultimate capability is automatic takeoff recognition, initial target classification, rate of climb indication, and track to destination-all important contributions to the counterdrug command, control, and interdiction team", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "34", "date_publication": "Jan 1998", "inspec": "5838604", "date": "Jan 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "31 - 34", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
