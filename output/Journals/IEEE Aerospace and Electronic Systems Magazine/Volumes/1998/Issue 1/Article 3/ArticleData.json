In this paper, space application environment and error sources have been systematically analyzed, including geometric location of user with GPS satellites, dynamic state, physical environment and the effects on positioning accuracy. Several special differential GPS technologies to space use are proposed", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "Jan 1998", "inspec": "5838603", "date": "Jan 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "25 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Jianping Yuan", "Huamin Jia", "Qun Fang"], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "delays", "error compensation", "ionospheric electromagnetic wave propagation", "relativity", "EM environment", "GPS satellites", "all-weather capabilities", "differential GPS technologies", "dynamic state", "error analysis", "error sources", "geometric location", "mission cost", "mission effectiveness", "multipath", "physical environment", "positioning accuracy", "relativity", "space application environment", "space environment", "space vehicles", "time delay", "Cost function", "Global Positioning System", "Information analysis", "Instruments", "Low earth orbit satellites", "Position measurement", "Space missions", "Space technology", "Space vehicles", "Vehicle dynamics", ""], "arnumber": "653820"}
