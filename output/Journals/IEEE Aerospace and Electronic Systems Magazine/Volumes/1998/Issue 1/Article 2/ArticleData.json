The Parker effect describes the correlation between these two rules and is at the heart of a new navigational technology called NIRPS. The Navigational Independent Relative Positioning System (NIRPS) uses the relation between an inertial medium (its own body) and a non-inertial medium (light) to provide information on the velocity (speed and direction) with which it is travelling in three-dimensional space. When the system is set in motion, the contrasts in the properties of the media result in an apparent deflection of the light. At the core of NIRPS is an a opto-electronic device called a \u201cvelometer\u201d. The velometer measures the magnitude and angle of the Parker effect, which directly represent the speed and direction, or velocity, of the system in space. Finally, from these results we can then interpret the present position of the system relative to its previous position", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "13", "date_publication": "Jan 1998", "inspec": "5838600", "date": "Jan 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "11 - 13", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["V.
