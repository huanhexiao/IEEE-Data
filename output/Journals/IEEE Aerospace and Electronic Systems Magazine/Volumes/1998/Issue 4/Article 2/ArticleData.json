Over 14 flight hours worth of collections were made of difficult to characterize clutter. This additional data can be utilized to develop and improve missile warning algorithms for better false alarm rates. These analyses show that although a two color staring system could have multiple advantages over a single color system in false alarm rejection, the clutter rejection capabilities can be limited by the relatively low inter-band correlations between the red and blue bands", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "29", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "35", "date_publication": "Apr 1998", "inspec": "5891531", "date": "Apr 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "4", "pages": "29 - 35", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
