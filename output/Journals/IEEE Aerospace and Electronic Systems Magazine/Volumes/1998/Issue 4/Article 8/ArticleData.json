In this paper, we survey the field of low-power communication systems from the avionics engineering perspective. We review the fundamental merits of optical fiber for information transmission and discuss various information modulation schemes. These modulation techniques determine the performance requirements for laser transmitters, We describe the horizontal- and vertical-cavity semiconductor lasers currently available for these systems, and measure their performance against the additional environmental constraints of avionics platforms. Finally, we outline expected near- and far-term trends in system and device development", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "Apr 1998", "inspec": "5891527", "date": "Apr 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "4", "pages": "9 - 12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
