Among the numerous services and applications which are requesting more frequencies, radar and telecommunications are certainly the most demanding. The purpose of this paper is to discuss several technical aspects contributing to the frequency management within the whole spectrum. To this effect it is proposed to analyse the following main aspects: first, a survey of the foreseeable evolution of telecommunications and radars mainly in terms of frequency band needs, radiated power density and waveforms; second, we will provide a comparative analysis of signals used in radars and telecommunications; finally, we propose a few necessary conditions to coordinate the operation of radars and telecommunications within the whole spectrum", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "Apr 1998", "inspec": "5891526", "date": "Apr 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "4", "pages": "3 - 8", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
