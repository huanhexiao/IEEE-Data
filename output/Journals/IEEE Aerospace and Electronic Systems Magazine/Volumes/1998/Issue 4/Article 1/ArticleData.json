This overall approach (called the More Electric Aircraft, MEA) has been analytically determined to provide dramatic improvements in reliability, maintainability, supportability and operations/support cost as well as enhancements in aircraft weight, volume, and battle-damage reconfigurability. A time- and technology availability-phased research and development program has been structured to demonstrate the required electrical component and subsystems performance to allow equivalent or improved aircraft performance over the use of hydraulic power. This paper provides: (1) a brief historical treatment of technology milestones achieved which enabled the MEA approach; (2) a status of USAF and DoD research and development programs in electrical power generation, distribution, energy storage, systems integration and flight testing; (3) a description of some of the USAF's planned demonstration activities in aircraft electrical power subsystems; and (4) the dual use nature of many of these technologies enabling a variety of electric and hybrid electrically-propelled military weapon systems and commercial vehicles", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "Apr 1998", "inspec": "5891529", "date": "Apr 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "4", "pages": "17 - 22", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
