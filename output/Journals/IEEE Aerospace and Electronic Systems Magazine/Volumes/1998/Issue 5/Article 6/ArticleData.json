These cells utilize a carbon anode, a manganese dioxide cathode and a solid polymer electrolyte. Electrode and electrolyte layers are thin and flexible. The electrode assembly is easily fabricated into thin, flat prismatic shapes using ordinary lamination techniques and is hermetically sealed in thin foil packaging. Cells ranging in capacity from 4 Ah to 50 Ah have been designed and are in development testing. The packaged cells have specific energies in excess of 100 Wh/kg. Prototype 30 volt batteries have also been designed and are being assembled and tested along with the critical battery cell charge management controllers needed to recharge all cells to full capacity while preventing overvoltage damage. The major results of this development effort are reviewed and the key issues for advancing this technology to flight qualification demonstrations are discussed", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "33", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "36", "date_publication": "May 1998", "inspec": "5922141", "date": "May 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "33 - 36", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["V.
