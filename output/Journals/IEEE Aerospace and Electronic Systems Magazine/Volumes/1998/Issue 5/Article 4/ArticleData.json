Clear advantages include the possibility of installing the instrumentation into currently existing motor systems without any need to use flexible couplings or mounts. The proposed system covers frequencies up to several kilohertz and can handle torque transients of 20 Nm with a typical uncertainty of 1%. The preliminary system is extendable to cover adaptive control of dynamic drive performance and can be customized to specific speed and torque ranges", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "May 1998", "inspec": "5922139", "date": "May 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "21 - 23", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["O.
