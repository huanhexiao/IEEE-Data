The COUNTERFOIL technology provides a means of covert information storage and is used as the basis for a range of security seals and labels. The technology has obtained Australian Government Endorsement (SCEC Endorsement) for use in high security applications. It provides a convenient, low cost means to determine authenticity and detect tampering or surreptitious access", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "6", "date_publication": "May 1998", "inspec": "5922137", "date": "May 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "3 - 6", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
