The increasing demand for reliable communication and data access is driving explosive growth in the number of satellite systems being developed as well as their performance requirements. Power-on orbit is the key to this performance, and batteries are becoming increasingly unattractive as an energy storage media. Flywheel systems offer very attractive characteristics for both energy storage, in terms of energy density and the number of charge/discharge cycles, and the important side benefit of spacecraft attitude control", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "32", "date_publication": "May 1998", "inspec": "5922140", "date": "May 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "27 - 32", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["S.
