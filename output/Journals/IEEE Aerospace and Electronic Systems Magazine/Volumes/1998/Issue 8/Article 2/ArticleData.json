Repeatability better than 1 dB is readily achieved if the scale reduction is between 1:5-1:15. Many measurements are possible with a very short anechoic test range, just fulfilling the far field requirement. Typical findings include the possibility to effectively reduce interference minima caused by adjacent vertical structures by simply positioning a thin absorptive sheet to the optimum location. Improvements of the order of 20 to 30 dB have been measured", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "33", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "35", "date_publication": "Aug 1998", "inspec": "6013440", "date": "Aug 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "33 - 35", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
