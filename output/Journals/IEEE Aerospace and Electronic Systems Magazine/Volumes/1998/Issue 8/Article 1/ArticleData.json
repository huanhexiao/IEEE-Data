The principle of jet propulsion seems to work perfectly; jet engines can accelerate a rocket up to an incredible speed of 11 km/sec. Looks like there is nothing left to desire. However, from the physical point of view, 11 km/sec is not such a large value compared, for instance, to the speed of light. Would it be possible to attain half of that speed using gas jets? Unfortunately, the answer is no. Nevertheless, that is not the end of the story. The purpose of this article is to show that it is still possible to use the same principle to remove limitations on attainable speed if instead of gas jets, we employ ultrafast electron beams. The basic idea of our construction was inspired by the paper by H. Morgan (ibid., vol. 13, pp. 5-10, 1998). In that article he experimentally refuted the common premise that nothing can go faster than light and gave some theoretical arguments supporting his experimental data. Although the nature and underlying principles of the Morgan phenomenon are yet to be understood, we can already start thinking of its practical applications", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "5", "date_publication": "Aug 1998", "inspec": "6013438", "date": "Aug 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "3 - 5", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["O.
