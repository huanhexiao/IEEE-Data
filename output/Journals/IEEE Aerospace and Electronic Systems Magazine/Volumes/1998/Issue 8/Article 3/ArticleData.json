The origins and use of flywheel technology for mechanical energy storage began several hundred years ago and was developed throughout the Industrial Revolution. One of the first \u201cmodern\u201d dissertations on the theoretical stress limitations of rotational disks (isotropic only) is the seminal work by A. Stodola whose first translation to English was made in 1917. The next big milestones were during the 1960s and 1970s when NASA sponsored programs proposed energy storage flywheels as possible primary sources for space missions. However, it was not until the 1980's when microelectronics, magnetic bearing systems and high power density motor-generators became enabling technologies. The next decade proved that a mechanical battery could surpass chemical batteries for many applications", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Aug 1998", "inspec": "6013439", "date": "Aug 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "13 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
