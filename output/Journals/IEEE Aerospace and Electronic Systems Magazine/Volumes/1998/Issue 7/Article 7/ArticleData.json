It is a time-consuming image understanding task to recognize targets in low SCR images. As in IR images, the bridges usually have almost the same gray level range of the background, the typical segmentation algorithm cannot get correct segmentation labels and edge sites of the bridges. The gray level characters of both the lands, which connect the bridge, and the river are fully considered resulting in a method that can be realized effortlessly and quickly. The criteria are also presented to decide whether there exist bridges or not in the given images, so the method endows the system with the ability to seize the target automatically. Some experimental results are presented demonstrating that the method can effectively recognize bridges in IR images", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "Jul 1998", "inspec": "5994464", "date": "Jul 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "21 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Haixin Chen", "Zhenkang Shen", "Jianjun Shen"], "keywords": ["edge detection", "image segmentation", "infrared imaging", "IR images", "background", "bridge search", "edge sites", "gray level range", "low SCR images", "river", "segmentation algorithm", "segmentation labels", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Bridges", "Histograms", "Image recognition", "Image segmentation", "Infrared imaging", "Layout", "Pixel", "Shape", "Target recognition", ""], "arnumber": "690815"}
