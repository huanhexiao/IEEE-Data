The ability to place an optical telescope at a significant distance from the Earth's surface, away from the interference of the planet's unsteady atmosphere, have already paid off by producing magnificent records of astronomical activities in the depths of outer space. In the past the problems with the alignment of the Hubble's optics were blamed on the manufacturers of it's optical components. The hastily set investigation concluded that the problem is a spherical aberration of the primary mirror (the primary mirror is said to be 2 microns too flat at the edges). It is suggested that the real culprit is the Parker Effect. Since the time of Galileo Galilei, all telescopes were built, aligned, and used on the Earth's surface. Hubble is the first telescope to be built and aligned on Earth for use in space. Because of this we have to consider the fundamental differences between the alignment of surface-based and space-based telescopes. For those who missed our article \u201cThe Parker Effect and Navigation in Space\u201d published in the January issue.
