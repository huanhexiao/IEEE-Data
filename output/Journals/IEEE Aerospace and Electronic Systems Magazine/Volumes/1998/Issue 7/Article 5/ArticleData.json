AMETHYST will automatically assess the cause of PIDS alarms and pass to an operator those alarms likely to be caused by an intruder. It will filter out alarms not likely to have a human cause. A previous paper explaining and exploring the AMETHYST concept was presented at the 1995 Carnahan Conference. Since then PSDB has produced a single channel AMETHYST demonstrator and placed a contract for the development of an eight channel prototype AMETHYST system. This updated paper gives details of the hardware and software used with these two systems. Also described is PSDB's approach to the development of AMETHYST's automatic assessment algorithms. These will combine current expertise from Video Motion Detection (VMD) and Intelligent Scene Monitoring (ISM) systems with the unique AMETHYST approach. AMETHYST analyses picture sequences from before and after an alarm instead of continuously analysing live video. Sequences are provided by a Loop Framestore, either connected to or part of the AMETHYST system. The algorithms will be assessed and developed using PSDB's growing collection of over 150 alarm sequences", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "36", "date_publication": "Jul 1998", "inspec": "5994466", "date": "Jul 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "31 - 36", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
