The discussion centres on the controls. Then the format of control words and an algorithm, which are effectively used to control the stepping motor are given. This algorithm has a function of parallel control and has already been used in our research. The design of the antenna servo system and the fining step pitch (FSP) control of the stepping motor will benefit from this paper", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "6", "date_publication": "Dec 1998", "inspec": "6122034", "date": "Dec 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "12", "pages": "3 - 6", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Huang Yong"], "keywords": ["aircraft antennas", "aircraft control", "angular velocity control", "attitude control", "computerised control", "pointing systems", "remotely operated vehicles", "servomechanisms", "stepping motors", "target tracking", "telecontrol", "telemetry", "algorithm", "antenna servo system", "coordinate control", "fining step pitch control", "format of control words", "handwheel messages", "horizontal azimuthal angle", "interruption program", "parallel control", "pilotless aircraft", "stepping motor control", "telemetering antenna", "tracking system design", "Aircraft", "Automatic control", "Azimuth", "Communication system control", "Control systems", "Displays", "Frequency", "Hardware", "Microcomputers", "Receiving antennas", ""], "arnumber": "735947"}
