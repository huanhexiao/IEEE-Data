It integrates new avionics, new ground systems, new procedures, avionics certification, and operational approval. Approximately 2000 aircraft operating in Alaska, Hawaii, and Oceanic airspace will be equipped with new capabilities enabling benefits such as improved situational awareness, increased flexibility, and efficiency gains. By developing and fielding these operational improvements, the actual benefits of new procedures and capabilities will be validated and risks associated with national implementation will be reduced", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "29", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "33", "date_publication": "Dec 1998", "inspec": "6122040", "date": "Dec 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "12", "pages": "29 - 33", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
