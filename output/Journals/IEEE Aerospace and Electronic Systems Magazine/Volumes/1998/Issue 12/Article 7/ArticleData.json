However, using practical equipment to train the aircrew is work of high cost and risk. In this paper, a system of simulation training for unmanned aircraft is introduced. Its function and composition are explained in detail. In practice, the system not only decreases training cost and risk, but also strengthens training effectiveness and diversity", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "13", "date_publication": "Dec 1998", "inspec": "6122036", "date": "Dec 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "12", "pages": "11 - 13", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Huang Yong", "Wang Yongsheng", "Li Xiangpeng"], "keywords": ["aerospace simulation", "aircraft control", "computer based training", "remotely operated vehicles", "control PC", "control cabinet", "proficiently operating", "reduced training cost", "simulation training system", "training diversity", "training effectiveness", "unmanned aircraft", "Aerospace control", "Aerospace simulation", "Antenna accessories", "Control systems", "Costs", "Electromagnetic measurements", "Military aircraft", "Military communication", "Sea measurements", "Unmanned aerial vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "735949"}
