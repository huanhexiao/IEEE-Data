Both the absolute and relative navigation information is required for this multi-spacecraft system, but the relative information is more critical and the accuracy requirements for relative information will be much higher than those for the absolute information. In this paper, the Global Positioning System (GPS)/Differential GPS (DGPS) are introduced and used for relative navigation. Relative motion of space vehicles is modeled. Relative position, relative velocity and relative attitude are represented and solved by GPS/DGPS measurements. Using a type of commercial GPS receiver onboard spacecraft and relative differential GPS technique, the relative navigation of space vehicles can be implemented in real-time", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "Dec 1998", "inspec": "6122039", "date": "Dec 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "12", "pages": "25 - 28", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Jianping Yuan", "Jianjun Luo", "Xiaomu Dou", "Qun Fang"], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "artificial satellites", "attitude control", "pointing systems", "Global Positioning System", "absolute navigation information", "differential GPS", "kinematical restraint", "multi-spacecraft system", "real-time implementation", "relative attitude", "relative motion of space vehicles", "relative navigation information", "relative pointing", "relative position", "relative velocity", "Global Positioning System", "Moon", "Motion analysis", "Navigation", "Position measurement", "Satellite broadcasting", "Space technology", "Space vehicles", "Vehicle dynamics", "Velocity measurement", ""], "arnumber": "735952"}
