This project is funded under the International Space Station (ISS) Phase I activities which involve joint US/Russian cooperative efforts to reduce risk and enhance working relationships in preparation for the joint integration of ISS. Of the projects falling under the Phase I program, the SD Flight Demonstration (SDFD) project is most complex in terms of the level of interfacing required. This paper provides a brief description of the solar dynamic technology, the project chronology of events, the US/Russian roles on the SDFD project, the project schedule, and project management tools used in dealing with the international team", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "36", "date_publication": "Feb 1996", "inspec": "5209235", "date": "Feb 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "31 - 36", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
