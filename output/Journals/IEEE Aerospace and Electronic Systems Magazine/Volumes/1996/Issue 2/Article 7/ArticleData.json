The impedance matching strongly depends on the size of the reflector, which should be by a factor of 1.2 longer than given by classical theory. The shape and size of the ground plane itself can be varied considerably with little or no effect on either the radiation pattern or the impedance characteristics but, on the other hand, inaccurate mutual positioning of the individual elements has a drastic influence. Material conductivity is not of prime concern", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "37", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "40", "date_publication": "Feb 1996", "inspec": "5209236", "date": "Feb 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "37 - 40", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
