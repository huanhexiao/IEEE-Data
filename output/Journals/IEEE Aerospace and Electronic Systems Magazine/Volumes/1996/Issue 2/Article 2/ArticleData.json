This paper presents a feasibility demonstration of one particular proposal for a safety kernel via the application of traffic light control. The paper begins with the safety properties for traffic light control and specifies a kernel that maintains the safety properties. An implementation sketch of the kernel in Ada is given and use of the kernel is discussed. The contribution of the paper is a demonstration that a kernel is a feasible and desirable technique for software in a realistic, safety-critical application. The paper also illustrates how formal methods aid the software engineer in constructing and reasoning about such software", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "19", "date_publication": "Feb 1996", "inspec": "5209232", "date": "Feb 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "13 - 19", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
