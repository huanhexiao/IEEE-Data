As a result, when these variables are not controlled from one experiment to another, many experimental results cannot be replicated. Recently, Blanchard and Blackman [1994] developed an ion parametric resonance (IPR) model to predict how parallel DC and low frequency AC magnetic fields might influence biological systems. Further, the IPR model has something different from previous models in this area: it is supported by an extensive, and growing, body of experimental data", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "6", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "Feb 1996", "inspec": "5209231", "date": "Feb 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "6 - 10", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
