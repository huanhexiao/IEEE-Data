While the basic topology and system elements have remained the same, there are important differences in connectivity, assembly sequence, and start-up. The key drivers for these changes in architecture have been the goal to simplify verification, and most significantly, the introduction of extensive Russian participation in the program. Having the Russians join the international community in this project has resulted in an expanded station size, larger crew, and almost doubled the observable surface of the Earth covered by the station. For the power system it has meant additional interfaces for power transfer, and new challenges for solar tracking at the higher inclination orbit. This paper reviews the current architecture and emphasizes the new features that have evolved, as the design for the new, larger station has developed. Additionally, the possible application of developing technology to the station, and other future missions is considered", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "Feb 1996", "inspec": "5209234", "date": "Feb 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "25 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["E.
