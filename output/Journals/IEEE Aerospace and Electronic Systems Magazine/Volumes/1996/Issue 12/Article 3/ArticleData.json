The method has incorporated several existing fast ambiguity search concepts and the ambiguity search speed can be further improved. In addition to the improvement of the ambiguity search speed, special attention has been paid to the improvement of the reliability of the ambiguity search process. Several theoretical and practical aspects involved in an ambiguity search algorithm are also addressed which have not been explored in previous literatures", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "22", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "Dec 1996", "inspec": "5476067", "date": "Dec 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "12", "pages": "22 - 26", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Yang Gao", "J.
