Within a strict thirty-day project time limit, several thousand potential target contributors were addressed using the Internet. Within a few weeks time, resulting inputs were received internationally from young professionals linked to space to form the basis of the final analysis. The results fundamentally showed that some historically driving motivations, such as national security, prestige and technology development, were not well supported as major rationale for space activities. General misconceptions regarding the magnitude of space expenditures were further highlighted. Together with identification of the main perceived barriers for progress and specific priorities in more detailed areas, a set of basic components of a fundamental space policy for the future were eventually formulated", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Dec 1996", "inspec": "5476065", "date": "Dec 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "12", "pages": "13 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
