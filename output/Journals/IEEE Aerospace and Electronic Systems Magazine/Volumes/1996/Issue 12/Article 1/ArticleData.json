This system rapidly produces geocoded SAR imagery and digital terrain elevation data. The dual-channel, X-band SAR is installed in the ERIM Learjet 36. The ground processor was developed in collaboration with the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The system produces 1.5 to 3.0 meters (1 sigma) absolute accuracy three-dimensional terrain elevation data over large areas without the use of ground control points. Several examples from recent data collections are presented", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "35", "date_publication": "Dec 1996", "inspec": "5476069", "date": "Dec 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "12", "pages": "31 - 35", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["G.
