The concept provides a simple way to establish a target detect-clutter reject threshold at each range cell, whether a MTI canceler only or a bank of Doppler filters is used. In its simplest form, the target detect/clutter reject threshold is based on the ratio of the magnitudes of Doppler-processed and non-Doppler processed signals. The experiment showed that clutter was rejected, but the amount of added degradation in detection sensitivity was not determined. This degradation will depend on a number of factors, including the number of pulses per beamwidth", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "21", "date_publication": "Dec 1996", "inspec": "5476066", "date": "Dec 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "12", "pages": "17 - 21", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
