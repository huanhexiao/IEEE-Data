While each of these systems supports performing an isolated task, the compilation of tools presents a number of challenges. This paper reports ways in which the Tower Control Computer Complex (TCCC) will support and enhance user management of numerous systems. Areas that will be notably improved include the consistency in the user interface of the air traffic control toolset, the task of manually integrating tools and information, toolset alert management, and toolset organization and administration", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "22", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "Apr 1996", "inspec": "5259613", "date": "Apr 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "4", "pages": "22 - 26", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
