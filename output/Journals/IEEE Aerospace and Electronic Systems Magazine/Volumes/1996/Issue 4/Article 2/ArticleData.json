The technological innovations in the AIMS design, coupled with an aggressive program schedule were major factors in the AIMS challenge. Honeywell and Boeing had to work closely together to complete the design and development of AIMS in a time frame that supported the 777 Early ETOPS goal. With teams from the two companies working as one unit, redundant activities were eliminated, technical and program problems were identified and solved rapidly, and schedule time was saved by both teams helping with tasks that were traditionally considered to be the other team's job", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "21", "date_publication": "Apr 1996", "inspec": "5259612", "date": "Apr 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "4", "pages": "17 - 21", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["B.
