With only two radiating elements conventionally installed on top of the fuselage, the system is capable of introducing a 30 dB radiation pattern minimum to desired or optimized directions. The system uses computer controlled parallel down conversion technique, which gives the freedom to automatically adjust for any anomalies in the respective individual element patterns, normally caused by the airframe structures. The same computer can be used for active search-and-minimize procedures. Extensive tests have been performed with an F-18 scale model to verify the system performance", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "8", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "11", "date_publication": "Apr 1996", "inspec": "5259611", "date": "Apr 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "4", "pages": "8 - 11", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
