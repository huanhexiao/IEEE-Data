The paper describes the concepts and the technical realization of such a system, including three components: ground subsystem, on-board subsystem and data communication link using TDMA technique. The purpose of the proposed AFGT system is to calibrate and verify performance of an on-board radar. Therefore, it must meet the requirements of evaluation of radar performances in several areas: accuracy, coverage range, and others. The AFGT System's displays are separately: a Moving Colored Digital Map on which flight trajectories, waypoints, and heights of aircrafts are clearly marked; and a Polar Coordinate Figure on which the bearings, headings, and distances of aircrafts relative to the origin of the ground control center are shown. The AFGT may monitor and guide several aircrafts flying in the pointed airspace. It support airport surface surveillance and air traffic control at the terminal area. A real-time software package RTTEST, which includes tracking display software and on-flight test software for radar evaluation, has conducted simulation with satisfactory position accuracy", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "Jul 1996", "inspec": "5338893", "date": "Jul 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "23 - 26", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Huamin Jia", "Xiaomu Dou", "Jianping Yuan"], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "air traffic control", "airborne radar", "aircraft control", "calibration", "data communication", "ground support equipment", "performance evaluation", "telecommunication equipment testing", "time division multiple access", "China", "GPS", "Moving Colored Digital Map", "Polar Coordinate Figure", "RTTEST", "TDMA", "accuracy", "air traffic control", "aircraft flight guidance/test system", "airport surface surveillance", "coverage range", "data communication link", "flight trajectories", "ground subsystem", "heights", "on-board radar", "on-board subsystem", "on-flight test software", "radar performances", "real-time software package", "tracking display software", "waypoints", "Aerospace control", "Air traffic control", "Aircraft", "Data communication", "Displays", "Global Positioning System", "Performance evaluation", "Radar tracking", "System testing", "Time division multiple access", ""], "arnumber": "533968"}
