During this period, it has performed various assessments of advanced battery technology as well as established the Advanced Battery Task Force. The following paper is Mader's view of the status of battery technologies that are competing for the electric vehicle (EV) market being established by the California Air Resources Board's Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate. The ZEV market is being competed for by various advanced battery technologies. And, given the likelihood of modifications to the Mandate, the most promising technologies should capture the following market share during the initial 10 years: lead-acid-8.4%; nickel metal hydride-50.8%; sodium nickel chloride-7.8%; and lithium ion-33.0%. However, today there is much less certainty associated with EV market prediction due to changes in the ZEV regulations", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "Jul 1996", "inspec": "5338892", "date": "Jul 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "17 - 22", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
