A new method to calculate flight-path deviation by means of coordinate transforming is presented and the software of navigation and control is designed. This software is practical and effective for navigation by GPS with some characteristics including high-speed, high accuracy, real-time positioning and the use of digital mapping technique", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "34", "date_publication": "Jul 1996", "inspec": "5338895", "date": "Jul 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "31 - 34", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Xiaorong Sun", "Chunguang Xu", "Yongsheng Wang"], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "aerospace computing", "aerospace control", "position control", "real-time systems", "space vehicle electronics", "special purpose computers", "GPS", "control", "coordinate transforming", "digital mapping", "flight-path deviation", "global positioning system", "navigation", "real-time positioning", "software", "unmanned space vehicles", "Aerospace electronics", "Aerospace engineering", "Automotive engineering", "Control systems", "Earth", "Ellipsoids", "Global Positioning System", "Navigation", "Space vehicles", "Sun", ""], "arnumber": "533970"}
