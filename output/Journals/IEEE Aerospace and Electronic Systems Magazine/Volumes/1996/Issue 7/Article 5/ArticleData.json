Then, the software employed to calculate the applied altitude of GPS in a space vehicle is explained. The detailed software flowchart is also given, and the process of choosing used GPS satellites is described in detail. In order to study the receiving condition in a space vehicle, we also make a simulating calculation with our software. The results of receiving GPS satellites over a certain place are given. The paper has not only the value for using GPS in a space vehicle, but also the significance for an aircraft whose navigation system is GPS", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "35", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "38", "date_publication": "Jul 1996", "inspec": "5338896", "date": "Jul 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "35 - 38", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Xiangpeng Li", "Yongsheng Wang", "Lu Gao"], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "aerospace computing", "antenna radiation patterns", "flowcharting", "satellite antennas", "software engineering", "GPS satellite antenna", "altitude", "navigation system", "radiant angle", "software flowchart", "space vehicle", "Aircraft navigation", "Artificial satellites", "Earth", "Flowcharts", "Global Positioning System", "Receiving antennas", "Satellite antennas", "Satellite navigation systems", "Space vehicles", "Transmitting antennas", ""], "arnumber": "533971"}
