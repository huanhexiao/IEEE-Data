Many of these \u201csolutions\u201d have been effective for long range mass destruction but have not been applicable for the close-in hand-to-hand combat that is on our streets. Our goal at the Hughes AET Center has been to convert \u201chigh tech\u201d DoD capabilities into cost effective tools to help law enforcement agencies do their jobs better. Surveillance systems presently used by law enforcement officers make extensive use of television, infrared and other Line-of-Sight (LOS) surveillance systems. However, these systems cannot tell what is happening on the other side of a wall, behind bushes, around the corner, in the dark or through a dense fog. A new sensor has been developed that uses technology developed by the DoD for missile warhead fuzing. This small, light weight, low power \u201cRadar\u201d is based upon the fact that radio waves can penetrate nonmetallic materials. This new surveillance capability can help provide information about what is in a wall, ceiling or floor or on the other side of a door or concrete wall. Real field scenarios are used in this paper to show how this radar works and how field users can tell if someone is moving inside a building, even from remote locations", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "6", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "9", "date_publication": "Oct 1996", "inspec": "5402625", "date": "Oct 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "6 - 9", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["L.
