In particular, most of the progress made in the past ten years, using power electronics and electric machines for VSCF systems is reported. Two VSCF systems, based on induction and switched reluctance machine technologies, are presented. The research on the singly- and doubly-fed induction machines has focused on VSCF for wind power generation; whereas, that on switched reluctance machines has been directly studied as a VSCF technology in aircraft system. Results obtained so far favor the switched reluctance machine over the induction machine. Based on the foregoing comparative review, it is recommended that the induction machine be fully investigated as a VSCF drive in aircraft system. The findings should then be compared with the counterpart SRM system. Issues of comparison may include fault tolerance and redundancy, power density, torque requirements, overload ratings, temperature range and cooling, efficiency and stability over expected operating speed range.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "Oct. 1996", "inspec": "5402628", "date": "Oct. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "17 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
