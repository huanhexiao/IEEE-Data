Many workstations, such as a cockpit, have limited data available for creating the CAD models required for human performance analysis. To create a model, a time-consuming, labor-intensive process of collecting measurement data by hand must be performed, resulting in a CAD model of questionable accuracy. In order to conduct accurate repeatable analysis, CAD data for all workstations must be collected quickly and in a standardized format. A demonstration project assessed the feasibility of using Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) technology to collect workstation geometry and create a CAD Model. Baseline data for comparing hand collection methods was derived from previous aircraft cockpit CAD modeling projects. This method involved approximately two weeks for data collection alone and another week to create the CAD model. The CMM technology was determined to be a cost-effective method for creating CAD models of aircraft cockpits. This technology substantially reduced the time required to build a high fidelity CAD model while significantly improving the accuracy of the data", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Oct 1996", "inspec": "5402627", "date": "Oct 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "14 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["B.
