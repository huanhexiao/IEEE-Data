The ELDORA/ASTRAIA radar is designed to provide high resolution measurements of the air motion and rainfall characteristics of atmospheric storms which are too large, remote or fast-moving to be adequately observed by ground-based radars. This paper discusses the measurement requirements and the design goals of the radar and presents sample measurements from a recent weather research field program", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "34", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "37", "date_publication": "Oct 1996", "inspec": "5402631", "date": "Oct 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "34 - 37", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
