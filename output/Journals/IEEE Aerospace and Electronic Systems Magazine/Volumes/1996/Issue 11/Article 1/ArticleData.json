These changes have resulted in a vehicle that is very different from the \"Solar Rolar\", The Dakota Sun is a three wheeled vehicle with separate cab and solar array. This design allows for improved aerodynamics, decreased weight, lower rolling resistance, and ease of manufacture compared to the four wheeled catamaran used in the last race. However, this design sacrifices total enclosed wheel base area, additional room for components, and added power from side solar panels, The major objectives for the team's redesigned Sunrayce '97 entry are: systems integration; decrease the weight of the car; decrease aerodynamic drag; more efficient use of available energy; and increased driver safety. The team has set a standard to use the latest available technology. Although this increases the complexity of the components, by using a systems engineering approach the \"Dakota Sun\" has evolved into a more integrated vehicle. This philosophy of integrated design has resulted in great improvements in mechanical design and manufacturing techniques, as well as electrical innovations. The major design changes evident from the original Sunraycen '95 vehicle are the result of an evolutionary design process that has produced the highly competitive Sunraycel '97 design outlined in this article.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "6", "date_publication": "Nov. 1996", "inspec": "5476056", "date": "Nov. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "11", "pages": "3 - 6", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
