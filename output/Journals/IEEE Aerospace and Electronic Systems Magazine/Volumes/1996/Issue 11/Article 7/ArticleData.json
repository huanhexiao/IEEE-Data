This paper discusses the use of thinned stepped frequency waveforms, which enable the radar to switch between RF frequencies to provide a synthesized wide RF bandwidth, while the thinning may alleviate some of the constraints imposed on the radar. Random and periodic thinning are discussed in the first part of this paper. However, thinning may cause degradation in image quality, thus an additional technique-Sequence CLEAN deconvolution-is suggested. Sequence CLEAN is an iterative deconvolution algorithm, adopted from the field of radioastronomy, which is capable of resolving close targets in a dense environment, where the system response is heavily affected by high sidelobes", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "39", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "43", "date_publication": "Nov 1996", "inspec": "5476062", "date": "Nov 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "11", "pages": "39 - 43", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
