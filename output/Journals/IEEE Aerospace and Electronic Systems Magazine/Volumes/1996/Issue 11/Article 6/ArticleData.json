Unique is the radar's ability to generate SAR images of a selected area while simultaneously detecting and tracking all-speed moving objects located within that imaged region. Northrop Grumman Norden Systems has recently upgraded and adapted this radar to smuggling interdiction and related law enforcement missions. These adaptations have added an integrated GPS/INS subsystem for enhanced self-navigation and target location accuracy, a long range wide-band digital data link and ground station for mission control and data dissemination, a 3-D interferometric SAR imaging capability for detailed high resolution topographic mapping, and 1 meter and 0.3 meter resolution SAR modes for positive target identification. Additionally, the radar has been installed into wing-mounted pods and adapted for side-looking and 360 degree coverage applications. Automatic target detection and enhanced-range sea-surveillance and air-targeting modes are also now available through the use of open architecture commercial processors and non-proprietary transportable programming languages", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "Nov 1996", "inspec": "5476059", "date": "Nov 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "11", "pages": "19 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
