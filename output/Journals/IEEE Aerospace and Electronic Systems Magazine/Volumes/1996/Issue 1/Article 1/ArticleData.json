These Kalman filters model only the basic nine INS errors (position, velocity, and tilt) and do not model any INS gyro or accelerometer errors. It was found that a significant performance improvement could be achieved under conditions of degraded GPS satellite availability by augmenting this type of filter with the six INS gyro and accelerometer bias errors. It is, therefore, recommended that serious consideration be given to incorporating these states into the design of the GPS internal Kalman filter", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "Jan 1996", "inspec": "5192502", "date": "Jan 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "23 - 26", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
