This paper presents a survey of definitions drawn from a variety of sources in an attempt to abstract away from the terminology and focus instead on the fundamental concepts underlying the definitions. Two results are reported: first, a characterization of `dependability' as a subjective portmanteau of `entities' and `attributes;' second, a simple, yet rigorous, model for `errors, `failures' and `faults.' The latter model leads to a careful examination of the mechanisms by which undesired situations occur and propagate in complex integrated computer systems. The significance of these results is discussed", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "21", "date_publication": "Jan 1996", "inspec": "5192501", "date": "Jan 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "14 - 21", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
