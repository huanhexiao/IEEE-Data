But what of identical clocks constructed and calibrated in different IFRs? This paper takes a look at such a scenario, demonstrating that two such clocks would tick synchronously and concludes with a new look at the famous \u201ctwin-paradox\u201d of special relativity", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "31", "date_publication": "Jan 1996", "inspec": "5186593", "date": "Jan 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "27 - 31", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
