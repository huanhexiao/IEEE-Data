The general nature of the mathematical model permitted EVs of all types, including bicycles and magnetic levitation vehicles, to be evaluated and compared for acceleration levels, elapsed time, and elapsed distance performance in a standardized framework, with acceptable accuracy in comparison to the performance results published in the public domain. The aerodynamic coefficients and the skin friction component of the total aerodynamic drag coefficient could be estimated", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "40", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "44", "date_publication": "Jan 1996", "inspec": "5186595", "date": "Jan 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "40 - 44", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["F.
