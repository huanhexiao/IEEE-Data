One of the reasons underlying automation-related problems is the relatively indiscriminate application of automation based on technological availability rather than operator need. This has placed system operators in roles that are poorly suited to human capabilities. A more productive approach to automation and humans would be to recognize the need to maintain appropriate roles for the human operator, the need to match automation functionality to operator tasks, the need for the human interface to make automation functions highly visible to the operator, and the potential for operator over- and under-reliance on the automation", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "May 1996", "inspec": "5283880", "date": "May 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "3 - 8", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["V.
