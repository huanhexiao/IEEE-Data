The approach is based on a selective use of specification languages. Its aim is to compose partial avionics specifications in a unified format which is used for later concurrent hardware/software design steps. A demonstrator of the approach is currently in progress. It deals with the re-design of an avionics on-board system that belongs to the family of AIRBUS A340. The multi-languages specification is achieved through three graphical specification languages: Harel's StateCharts, SDL and SAO. The status of work and future perspectives are outlined", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "33", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "38", "date_publication": "May 1996", "inspec": "5283884", "date": "May 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "33 - 38", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
