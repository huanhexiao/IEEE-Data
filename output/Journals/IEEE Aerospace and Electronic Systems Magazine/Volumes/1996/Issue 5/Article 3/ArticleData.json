This is keeping prices high and supplies scarce-a situation expected to continue for at least several more years. Multichemistry chargers, while challenging to design, keep price-performance points flexible and guard against interruptions in supply. This paper surveys the design issues in implementing chargers that handle NiCd, NiMH, or Li-ion cells interchangeably", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "May 1996", "inspec": "5283882", "date": "May 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "23 - 26", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["W.
