Present efforts are focused on the development and demonstration of very low cost, quiet, high performance, safe, environmentally compatible, rechargeable batteries for heavyweight and lightweight torpedoes and tactical-sized UUVs. Electric power plants consisting of a rechargeable battery and a high reliability motor must be affordable to own and operate and enable turn-around without teardown for today's Fleet assets", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "31", "date_publication": "May 1996", "inspec": "5283883", "date": "May 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "27 - 31", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
