Their driver circuits often require multiple-output, isolated power supplies. This paper presents a simple flyback power supply especially designed for the driver boards of three-phase IGBT inverters. The detailed circuit diagrams and typical waveforms are reported. Certain performance data are given. The power supplies have been used in 100 kVA inverters for an electric vehicle drive and for a wind turbine inverter", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "24", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "Aug 1996", "inspec": "5366455", "date": "Aug 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "24 - 28", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Liuchen Chang"], "keywords": ["driver circuits", "insulated gate bipolar transistors", "invertors", "power semiconductor switches", "power supply circuits", "100 kVA", "200 kVA", "circuit diagrams", "driver board power supply", "driver boards", "driver circuits", "electric vehicle drive", "flyback power supply", "high power IGBT", "medium power inverters", "multiple-output isolated power supplies", "three-phase inverters", "waveforms", "wind turbine inverter", "Costs", "Driver circuits", "Electric vehicles", "Insulated gate bipolar transistors", "Power supplies", "Pulse transformers", "Pulse width modulation", "Pulse width modulation inverters", "Switching frequency", "Wind turbines", ""], "arnumber": "533752"}
