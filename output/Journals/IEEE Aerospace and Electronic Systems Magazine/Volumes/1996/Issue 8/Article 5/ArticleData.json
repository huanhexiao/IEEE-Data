From post-war documents, a connecting link can be found between key persons and organizations, which were once designing military electronics, but later adopted their know-how to the needs of public communications", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "7", "date_publication": "Aug 1996", "inspec": "5366450", "date": "Aug 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "3 - 7", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
