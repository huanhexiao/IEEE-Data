The BO in the acronym stands for Boeing and the MARC Stands for Michigan Aeronautical Research Center. Boeing built two versions of the BOMARC, the first one designated \u201cIM99A\u201d and the second \u201cIM99B\u201d. The \u201cA\u201d version used a liquid propellant boost system with a range of about 250 miles and the \u201cB\u201d used a solid propellant for boost and had a range of at least 400 miles. The BOMARC was a pilotless aircraft vehicle, developed and deployed to counter the Soviet massed bomber threat", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "29", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "33", "date_publication": "Aug 1996", "inspec": "5366451", "date": "Aug 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "29 - 33", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
