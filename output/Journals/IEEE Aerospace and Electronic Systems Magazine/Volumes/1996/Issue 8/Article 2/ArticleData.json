As an example, with the MiniCircuits VNA, a gain of about 15 dB can be achieved through the frequency band of 500 MHz to 3 GHz. Input matching can be near a VSWR of 1.9. At frequencies above 3 GHz however the input might provide a reflection coefficient greater than unity depending on the mechanical solutions of the test setup. Conventional assembly techniques can be used, but hybrid amplifiers are better-suited to more complex SMD boards", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "34", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "36", "date_publication": "Aug 1996", "inspec": "5366456", "date": "Aug 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "34 - 36", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
