These systems seek to emulate the type of reasoning that humans perform when solving complex tasks. The field of soft computing, as defined by Zadeh-the inventor of fuzzy logic-encompasses fuzzy logic as well as other methodologies such as neural networks, genetic algorithms, and uncertainty management. It is expected that soft-computing techniques will eventually become as common and prevalent as traditional methods of computer science. This paper presents an overview of applications of fuzzy logic and soft computing to space projects. The role of fuzzy systems that can learn from experience to improve their performance is discussed. We present a report on applications of these adaptive systems to NASA space projects such as the orbital operations of the Space Shuttle, which include attitude control and rendezvous/docking operations. We also provide insights on the future of computational intelligence and soft computing and of their vast potential in industrial applications", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "8", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "Aug 1996", "inspec": "5366452", "date": "Aug 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "8 - 10", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["H.
