In this paper, after briefly introducing positioning and navigation technologies for pilotless aircraft-a new kind of navigation system for pilotless aircraft using GPS (Global Positioning System) is presented. An overall plan of the navigation system is discussed, and its technology cruxes are analysed. Its hardware and software are designed and implemented, and experimental results are given. The navigation system not only has autonomous navigation capability, but can also achieve navigation aided by telecontrol system. It can supervise flying by telemetering system and displaying predetermined air line and flight path maps on the computer monitor. It can run in simple GPS receiver mode or in the differential GPS mode by means of available telecontrol channel. These are, no doubt, of great value for the navigation of pilotless aircraft", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "16", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "20", "date_publication": "Aug 1996", "inspec": "5366453", "date": "Aug 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "16 - 20", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Yongsheng Wang", "Xiangpeng Li", "Yong Huang"], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "aircraft computers", "aircraft control", "aircraft navigation", "fires", "flameproofing", "geophysical prospecting", "geophysical techniques", "remote sensing", "telemetry", "Earth measurement", "Earth surveying", "GPS", "GPS receiver mode", "Global Positioning System", "air line", "computer monitor", "differential GPS mode", "fireproofing", "flight path maps", "floods", "forest", "hardware", "mineral sources", "navigation", "pilotless aircraft", "positioning", "software", "telecontrol", "telemetering", "Aircraft manufacture", "Aircraft navigation", "Azimuth", "Electromagnetic measurements", "Global Positioning System", "Laser radar", "Military aircraft", "Radio navigation", "Satellite ground stations", "Sea measurements", ""], "arnumber": "533750"}
