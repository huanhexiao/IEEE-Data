One material in particular was developed by the Naval Ordnance Lab for use in sonar applications. TERFENOL-D, named for its primary constituents of terbium, iron and dysprosium and place of invention, generates usable strains of 1 mil per inch of material in an applied magnetic field, TERFENOL-D actuators provide 220 N to 880 N of force. Oil well logging shear wave generation using TERFENOL-D sources is accomplished with 1 A of current, providing 3,000 N of force. TERFENOL-D exhibits inverse magnetostriction, or the Villari effect, making it able to provide on demand nondestructive evaluation and inspection of structures, commonly referred to as magnetotagging", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "6", "date_publication": "Mar 1996", "inspec": "5234996", "date": "Mar 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "3 - 6", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["B.
