Typical single-chassis VXI systems include an embedded computer-based controller as the system host. Multi-chassis systems generally use a parallel bus or a local area network, such as Ethernet, to interconnect the chassis. An important class of multi-chassis test systems requires high I/O throughput, low latency and a highly deterministic I/O response. This paper describes a new highway interconnect system that includes host computer interface options for VMEbus, EISA and PCI bus. A typical system is configured with a host interface, a fiber-optic highway \u201cloop\u201d and slot-0 controllers in the VXI chassis. The system supports up to 126 VXI chassis, an aggregate I/O throughput of 10 megabytes per second, extremely low latency and a highly deterministic I/O response. Typical applications, including jet aircraft engine testing, missile test systems and high-performance wind tunnel data systems are discussed", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "Mar 1996", "inspec": "5234998", "date": "Mar 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "18 - 23", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
