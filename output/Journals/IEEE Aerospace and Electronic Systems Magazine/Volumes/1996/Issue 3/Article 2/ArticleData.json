Despite significant effort put into revising and updating the ATLAS standards over the last 25 years, the language is still only used when mandated and is not the automatic choice of engineers. In this article, we discuss the reasons for this and look at the future development of ATLAS", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "29", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "34", "date_publication": "Mar 1996", "inspec": "5235000", "date": "Mar 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "29 - 34", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
