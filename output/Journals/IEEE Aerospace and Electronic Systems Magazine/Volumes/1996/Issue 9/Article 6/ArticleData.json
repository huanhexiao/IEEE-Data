For example, remote flight line support, outdoor sporting events, and one-time events such as conferences, all could be well served through computer aided support and resources. However, the costs associated with, even solely, the physical labor required to lay conventional cabling for such an event is prohibitive. Weatherproofing and time constraints also come into play; but before wireless technologies can become ubiquitous, many implementation issues must be addressed. This paper provides an overview of these issues and the current trends", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "14", "date_publication": "Sep 1996", "inspec": "5396162", "date": "Sep 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "11 - 14", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["B.
