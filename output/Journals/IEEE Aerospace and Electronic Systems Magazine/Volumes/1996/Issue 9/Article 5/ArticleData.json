In order to match the low resistive LD, proposed in this paper is an exponential transmission line, which is used as preshaping to compensate the pattern effect in gain switching of laser diodes. It also will be used to overcome the effect of parasitic elements in high speed driving to improve the rise and trail edges of the output waveform. An accurate circuit model of the exponential line for the PSPICE program has been developed and simulations are conveniently carried out by employing PSPICE", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "7", "date_publication": "Sep 1996", "inspec": "5396160", "date": "Sep 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "4 - 7", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Zheng Li", "Yilcai Su", "Yueping Tang"], "keywords": ["SPICE", "aircraft communication", "circuit analysis computing", "driver circuits", "equivalent circuits", "optical fibre communication", "semiconductor device models", "semiconductor lasers", "transmission line theory", "waveform analysis", "PSPICE program", "airborne system", "circuit model", "exponential transmission line", "gain switching", "gain-switched laser diode", "high speed driving", "laser diodes", "low resistive LD", "output waveform", "parasitic elements", "pattern effect", "rise edges", "trail edges", "Circuit simulation", "Diode lasers", "Distributed parameter circuits", "Impedance", "Optical pulses", "Pattern matching", "Power transmission lines", "Pulse transformers", "SPICE", "Transmission lines", ""], "arnumber": "536796"}
