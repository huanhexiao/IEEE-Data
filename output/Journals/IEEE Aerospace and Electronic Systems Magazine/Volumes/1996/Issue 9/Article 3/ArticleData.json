The system employs a constellation of radar satellites in low-earth orbit to provide continuous world-wide target access. The radars employ reflector antennas, TWT transmitters and high frequency (e.g., X band) to achieve long range with relatively low weight, complexity and cost. The radars operate in moving-target-detection (MTD) and synthetic-aperture-radar (SAR) spotlight imaging modes to observe moving and fixed targets, respectively. The system could support a wide range of military, intelligence, law-enforcement and civilian missions", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "Sep 1996", "inspec": "5396164", "date": "Sep 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "21 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["G.
