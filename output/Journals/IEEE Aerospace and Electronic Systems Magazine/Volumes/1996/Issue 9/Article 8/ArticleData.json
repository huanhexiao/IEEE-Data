The analysis centers around a 200-800 MHz, dual-polarized ground penetrating radar (GPR) designed and built by SRI International. The analysis consisted of fusing the images from the dual polarizations into a single image to enhance the target objects and suppress clutter. Results are shown for several variations of a Mahalanobis-based fusion technique, and \u201csoft decision\u201d minefield detection results based upon Monte Carlo statistical techniques are also presented. Although relatively few scenes were analyzed, these results show that the dual-polarized GPR is potentially very effective at finding buried mines and minefields", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "30", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "39", "date_publication": "Sep 1996", "inspec": "5396166", "date": "Sep 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "30 - 39", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["S.
