Affordability is being addressed on numerous fronts such as hardware re-use, software re-use, COTS leveraging, and reduced cycle times. Each of these thrusts provide potential cost saving along with unique challenges. What is needed is a process that integrates these initiatives while ensuring the overall system objectives are achieved. An Open Systems-based process is key to integrating these initiatives and balancing affordability and system performance goals. Although Open Systems are being widely recognized as a key to affordability, most interpret Open Systems as a set of system attributes that need to be achieved. There are numerous claims of vendors saying they have an Open Systems architecture; or how their system will evolve to an Open Systems architecture. This emphasis is not on increasing affordability, but on attaching a politically-correct label to their product. In this paper, we focus on the Open Systems process as the key to affordability. An Open Systems process is based on Open Systems principles. This paper discusses the Open Systems principles and process in detail and shows how this process integrates numerous affordability initiatives", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "20", "date_publication": "Sep 1996", "inspec": "5396163", "date": "Sep 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "15 - 20", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
