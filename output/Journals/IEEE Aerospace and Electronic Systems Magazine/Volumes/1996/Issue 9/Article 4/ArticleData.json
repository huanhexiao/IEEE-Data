By automating the site selection and radar set-up processes, the FFPAS will significantly reduce the time and effort required to deploy FIREFINDER radars. Also, many radar effects that are difficult to include when calculations are performed manually, such as blind ranges and Doppler frequencies, variations in the target's radar cross sectional area (RCS), and the strength of the clutter return along a trajectory, can now be included in the radar siting and operational analyses. These capabilities will help the Army's FIREFINDER radars perform with maximum effectiveness on the modern battlefield", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "Sep 1996", "inspec": "5396165", "date": "Sep 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "25 - 29", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
