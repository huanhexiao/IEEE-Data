These needs will continue to increase as a result of the introduction of newer types of equipment, the increasing digitization of the battlefield, and future integrated Soldier Systems. Current battery programs are aimed at improved, low-cost primary batteries, and rechargeable batteries with increased energy densities. The Army fuel cell program aimed at portable systems capable of the order of 150 W is also described", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "Jun 1996", "inspec": "5300390", "date": "Jun 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "19 - 25", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
