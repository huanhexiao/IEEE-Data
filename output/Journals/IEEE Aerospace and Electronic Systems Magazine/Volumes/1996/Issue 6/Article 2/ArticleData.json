Air traffic controllers are instead presented with a primary radar picture showing all traffic on the airport movement area. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is evaluating different types of systems that will add the aircraft's call-sign or flight number to the radar image thereby allowing controllers to positively identify individual aircraft at all times.
