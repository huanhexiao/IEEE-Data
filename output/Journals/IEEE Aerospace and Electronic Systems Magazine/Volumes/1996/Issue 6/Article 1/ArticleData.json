Modern loads are very sensitive to these short duration glitches resulting in major losses in revenue through system down-time and loss of product from work in process. Many of these problems are caused by normal transients as equipment and factories go on-line or shut down. Others are caused by lightening strikes and faults on the distribution system. Although power utility companies attempt to minimize the interruptions through filtering and system management, power quality problems continue to cost American industry billions of dollars a year. Batteries have been used for many years in uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) to protect critical loads. However, because many new facilities have a network of broadly distributed critical loads, a UPS on the order of one to several megawatts is needed to support the total plant rather than several small kilowatt installations. This paper reports on the implementation of such a utility scale power quality management system", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "41", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "44", "date_publication": "Jun 1996", "inspec": "5300393", "date": "Jun 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "41 - 44", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["G.
