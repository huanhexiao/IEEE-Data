This global ATM concept is central to the Joint Planning and Development Office's (JPDO) Next Generation Air Transportation System (NGATS), and underlies Europe's Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) initiative. The availability of timely, accurate, and relevant aeronautical and meteorological information in the cockpit is critical for safe conduct of flight and forms the basis for Air Traffic Management (ATM) decision-making. The data-link of aeronautical and meteorological information will facilitate the creation of a common picture of the airspace situation for all flight crews, air traffic controllers, and airline operations personnel. Change notifications, timely warnings and alerts of threats to safe and efficient flight conduct will be enabled by these services. The ultimate goal is to provide access to on-line, real-time, quality information, and weather services to any aviation user, anytime, anywhere. In this framework, we present operational services and environment of the Aeronautical Information Management (AIM) and Meteorological (MET) data-link services envisaged to be implemented over the next decade in both Europe and the USA. It reflects concepts and system performance requirements currently developed by a joint EUROCAE (WG-76) / RTCA (SC-206) Committee. The envisaged AIM data-link services are presented: aeronautical updates both in textual and graphical fore, synchronization of aeronautical data between on-board and ground systems (exchange of permanent aeronautical data regardless of AIRAC cycles). The MET data-link services are also developed: weather planning, near-term, and reactive decision services.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "16", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "Aug. 2009", "date": "Aug. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Sep 22 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "8", "pages": "16 - 22", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Stephane Dubet"], "keywords": ["Air traffic control", "Air transportation", "Decision making", "Dissolved gas analysis", "Europe", "Information management", "Meteorology", "Personnel", "Quality management", "System performance", ""], "arnumber": "5256383"}
