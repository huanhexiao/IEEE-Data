In addition to that, recent progress is also discussed concerning specific inversion techniques to evaluate radar measurements; i.e., the art of deriving the relevant physical quantities to be determined such as terrain and depth profiles for planetary surface and/or subsurface structures ((3D)-profiles) from radar data measured depending on signal frequency, aspect angle, polarization, etc., as a function of time.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "43", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "44", "date_publication": "Aug. 2009", "inspec": "10880802", "date": "Aug. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Sep 22 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "8", "pages": "43 - 44", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Peter Edenhofer"], "keywords": ["planetary remote sensing", "planetary satellites", "spaceborne radar", "earth-orbiting satellites", "inversion technique", "planetary-orbiting satellites", "radar measurements", "space-borne radar technology", "subsurface structure", "Art", "Extraterrestrial measurements", "Frequency measurement", "Polarization", "Probes", "Radar measurements", "Satellites", "Space technology", "Spaceborne radar", "Time measurement", ""], "arnumber": "5256387"}
