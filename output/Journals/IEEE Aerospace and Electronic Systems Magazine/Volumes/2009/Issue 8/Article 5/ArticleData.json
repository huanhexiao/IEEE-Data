The system is called the Adaptive Context Information Processing Language (ACLPL) which will allow explicit use of states of context inferred from sensor readings and algorithmic output for distributed control of data fusion in sensor networks. The detailed description of the language including its use for sensor information separation into raw sensor data, feature, objects, and events by the language is described. Furthermore, the concept of context which aids the modeling of sensor data with the data fusion hierarchy is introduced, including its types, properties, and applications. ACIPL loosely follows the Joint Directors of Laboratories' Data Fusion Hierarchy and provides a powerful tool to facilitate the use of smart sensor networks for the purpose of sensor data fusion.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "36", "date_publication": "Aug. 2009", "date": "Aug. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Sep 22 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "8", "pages": "31 - 36", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Michael A.
