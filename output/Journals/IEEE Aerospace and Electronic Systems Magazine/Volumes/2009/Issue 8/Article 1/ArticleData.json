While NASA sponsored investigations on the ISS are focused largely on enabling future long duration human space exploration missions, Congress designated the US portion of the space station as a National Laboratory making its facilities available to other Federal agencies and private entities for non-exploration related ventures. RDT&E activities on the ISS encompass a number of technical areas including environmental control and life support, communications, materials science, guidance, navigation and control, propulsion, electrical power, and thermal control systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "Aug. 2009", "inspec": "10880800", "date": "Aug. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Sep 22 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "8", "pages": "4 - 8", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Ron Ticker"], "keywords": ["aerospace instrumentation", "Earth-based applications", "Federal agencies", "ISS", "International Space Station", "NASA", "National Laboratory", "RDT&amp", "E", "engineering test beds", "human space exploration missions", "multifaceted orbiting laboratory", "Communication system control", "Control systems", "Humans", "International Space Station", "Laboratories", "Materials science and technology", "NASA", "Space exploration", "Space stations", "Testing", ""], "arnumber": "5256380"}
