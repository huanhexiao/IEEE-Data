Security and vulnerabilities in wireless ad hoc networks have been considered at different layers, and many attack strategies have been proposed, including denial of service (DoS) through the intelligent jamming of the most critical packet types of flows in a network. This investigates the effectiveness of intelligent jamming in wireless ad hoc networks using the Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and TCP protocols and introduces an intelligent classifier to facilitate the jamming of such networks. Assuming encrypted packet headers and contents, our classifier is based solely on the observable characteristics of size, inter-arrival timing, and direction and classifies packets with up to \"9.4% accuracy in our experiments.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "Aug. 2009", "date": "Aug. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Sep 22 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "8", "pages": "23 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Tae Dempsey", "Gokhan Sahin", "Y.
