The final selection will depend on specific application requirements. From the several modalities existing nowadays, vascular systems have appeared on the scene lately. Vein-based identification is claimed to be as reliable as fingerprint or iris identification, but with the usability of hand geometry or even the face. As with any other biometric modalities, vascular solutions have to be deeply analyzed for all relevant factors that could affect their performance or the security level achieved. This will show the analysis of the performance and security achieved by a commercial vascular biometric system, when being applied in several real-world scenarios. These scenarios will cover typical office environments to the more extreme environments, such as extreme light and temperatures, as those suffered in a banking ATM, or with high humidity such as in a gym. The results will show the strengths of this modality, as well as those points where further improvements are needed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "14", "date_publication": "June 2009", "inspec": "10776265", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Jul 10 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "6", "pages": "4 - 14", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
