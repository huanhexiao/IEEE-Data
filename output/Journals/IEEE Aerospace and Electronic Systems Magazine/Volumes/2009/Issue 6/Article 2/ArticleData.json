Among the various existing types of software vulnerabilities, command injections are particularly common. It is a difficult problem to address, having seemingly endless variations. We present a unified, formal definition of command injections that, is not based on a particular technology and captures not only the existing variations but also the future instances of the problem. We then propose a Simple, yet effective, strategy to deal with the problem in existing large applications, focusing on the cost-effectiveness of the method. We also report on successful experiments applying our solution to large commercial applications.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "June 2009", "inspec": "10776266", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Jul 10 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "6", "pages": "15 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Guy-Vincent Jourdan"], "keywords": ["security of data", "software engineering", "command injections", "cost-effectiveness", "software engineering", "software security", "software vulnerabilities", "Application software", "Books", "Cellular neural networks", "Computer crime", "Information security", "Information technology", "Production systems", "Software engineering", "Software quality", "Software testing", ""], "arnumber": "5161718"}
