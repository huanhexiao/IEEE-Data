The MFVS system was originally developed as a passive IFR approach system for small general aviation planes. A relatively high adaptability is one of the main advantages. It can be easily used with many types of avionics devices. The GPSIINS system is used as the primary data source. The data from the GPSIINS system are pre-processed by proprietary neural network units that feed the 3-D visualization system. The neural network unit is responsible for adaptation of this system and can eliminate problems caused by data delays and data drop-outs. The 3D visualization unit processes data from the neural network unit and eventually from the 6DOF tracker that is placed on the pilot's Head Mounted Display (HMD). The unit then generates a 3D view of the surrounding environment that is similar to the 3D environment the pilot knows from flight simulators. The source of environment data is the terrain and object/obstacle database. The image output can be displayed on HIUD, MED, or HMD.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "April 2009", "inspec": "10588836", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Apr 24 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "4", "pages": "4 - 8", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Petr Bojda", "Petr Frantis"], "keywords": ["aerospace computing", "aircraft displays", "avionics", "data visualisation", "helmet mounted displays", "neural nets", "3D environment", "3D visualization system", "GPSIINS system", "HMD", "aviation plane", "avionics device", "data delay", "data drop-out", "flight simulator", "flight visualization system", "head mounted display", "multipurpose visualization system", "neural network unit", "Aerospace electronics", "Computer architecture", "Data visualization", "Delay estimation", "Graphics", "Head", "Liquid crystal displays", "Military aircraft", "Neural networks", "Visual databases", ""], "arnumber": "4839270"}
