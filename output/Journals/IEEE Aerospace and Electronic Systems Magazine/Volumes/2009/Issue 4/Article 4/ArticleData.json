What managers and engineers need to know", "abstract": "As part of a JPL-wide software quality initiative aimed at addressing the challenges of developing, managing, and acquiring software, a team at JPL generated a detailed Software Training Plan for both managers and engineers. The team took the approach of treating the software training program as though it were a system development task and went through all the typical phases of system development including requirements, design, and implementation. During the requirements collection phase, the team conducted dozens of interviews and identified the specific skills needed. The skills fell into categories such as software management, software engineering, systems engineering, and other technical areas. However, an equally important finding was that several \"soft\" skills were deemed critical for the successful and timely management and implementation of software-intensive systems. This discusses JPL's approach and \"lessons learned\" from planning and delivering a software training program in an engineering and scientific environment.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "35", "date_publication": "April 2009", "inspec": "10601270", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Apr 24 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "4", "pages": "25 - 35", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Trisha Jansma"], "keywords": ["aerospace computing", "aerospace propulsion", "computer science education", "software development management", "software quality", "systems analysis", "JPL-wide software quality", "jet propulsion laboratory", "requirement engineering", "software development", "software engineer", "software management", "software training plan", "system development task", "Engineering management", "Hardware", "Management training", "Project management", "Quality management", "Software development management", "Software quality", "Software safety", "Software tools", "Technology management", ""], "arnumber": "4839274"}
