The discipline of prognostics and health management (PHM) is being formalized to address the information management and prediction requirements for addressing these needs. Herein, we will explore how standards currently under development within the IEEE can be used to support PHM applications. Particular emphasis will be placed on the role of PHM and PHM-related standards with Department of Defense (DOD) automatic test systems-related research.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "34", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "41", "date_publication": "Sept. 2009", "inspec": "10927024", "date": "Sept. 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Oct 09 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "9", "pages": "34 - 41", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["John W.
