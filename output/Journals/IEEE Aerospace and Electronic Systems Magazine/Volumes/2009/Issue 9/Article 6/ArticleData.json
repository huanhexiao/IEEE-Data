This observation was the first mention about the possibility of object detection by means of radio waves. The first patent on the phenomena was obtained in 1904 by German engineer Christian Hiilsmeyer who called this device the \"Telemobiloskop\". However, neither A. Popov's observation nor C. Hulsmeyer's invention was the subject of any development up to the 1930s of the 20th century. This is a partial summary of the work done by the Soviet Union and Russia in the field of radar.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "B1", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "B32", "date_publication": "Sept. 2009", "inspec": "10917657", "date": "Sept. 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Oct 09 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "9", "pages": "B1 - B32", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["V.
