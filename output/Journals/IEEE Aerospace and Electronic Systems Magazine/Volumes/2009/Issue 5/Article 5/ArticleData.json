As communication technology improves, organizations can operate over wider distances and can even assemble operational components on an ad-hoc basis to meet requirements of a specific objective. Future air traffic communication studies are already discussing whether to operate IP networks that are combining voice and data transport. The problem is that although voice and data are using a common infrastructure, they remain separate at the application level. Probably, some service providers have already enjoyed reduced network infrastructure and operational costs by merging voice and data transport, but the majority may have failed to realize the significant cost, productivity, and service differentiation capabilities that converged, collaborative applications could bring. This elaborates mechanisms needed for a robust and globally interconnected network environment (including infrastructure, systems, processes, and people) in which data is shared timely and seamlessly among users, applications, and platforms. Such an environment enables substantially improved situational awareness and shortened decision-making cycles. Stepping ahead, our contribution discusses standards making application or service convergence a reality.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "26", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "32", "date_publication": "May 2009", "inspec": "10733076", "date": "May 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 26 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "5", "pages": "26 - 32", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Johannes Prinz", "Wolfgang Kampichier", "Bernhard Haindl"], "keywords": ["IP networks", "ad hoc networks", "telecommunication traffic", "IP networks", "ad-hoc basis", "air traffic communication", "communication technology", "data transport", "decision-making cycles", "information technology", "integrated communication environments", "service orientation principles", "Assembly", "Collaboration", "Communications technology", "Costs", "IP networks", "Information technology", "Merging", "Productivity", "Robustness", "Telecommunication traffic", ""], "arnumber": "5109950"}
