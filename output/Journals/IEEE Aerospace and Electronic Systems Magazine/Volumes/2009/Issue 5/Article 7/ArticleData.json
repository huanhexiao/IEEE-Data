In order to obtain higher accuracy for CVG it is necessary to use resonator evacuation. Resonator mass plays a very important role in sensitivity to angle rate, in stability of vibration, in response to environmental condition changes, and also to external vibration and shock resistance. Innalabs Holding Inc. uses a cylindrical resonator with increased rim thickness of up to 2 mmn and more. This concerns resonator material and design parameters selection, material thermal treatment to increase resonator Q-factor, and improved control algorithms in order to increase metallic CVG accuracy. As a result, CVG bias instability of 0.025 degth and random walk of 0.008 degvh for the resonator diameter 43 mmn, and 0.2 deg/h for the resonator diameter 25 mm were obtained. Future opportunities for Innalabs CVG is also discussed herein. Test results are presented for CVG43 and CVG25. Three-axis CVG unit under control of one DSP \"Share\" and IMU parameters are forecasted.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "40", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "43", "date_publication": "May 2009", "inspec": "10733077", "date": "May 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 26 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "5", "pages": "40 - 43", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["V.
