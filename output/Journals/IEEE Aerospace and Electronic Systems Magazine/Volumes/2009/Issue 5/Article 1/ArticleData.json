This is an activity carried out with great success by echo-locating mammals such as nectar feeding bats that are able to detect and select flowers of bat-pollinated plants, even in a dense clutter environment. Herein, data consisting of acoustically-generated high-range resolution profiles of four bat-pollinated flower heads are analysed. Multi-perspective classification performance is assessed and compared with the radar case. There are close parallels that suggest lessons can be learnt from nature.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "7", "date_publication": "May 2009", "inspec": "10733080", "date": "May 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 26 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "5", "pages": "4 - 7", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Alessio Balleri", "Karl Woodbridge", "Chris J.
