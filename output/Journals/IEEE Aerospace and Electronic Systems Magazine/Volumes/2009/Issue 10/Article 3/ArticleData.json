Courses are offered across the engineering spectrum (aerospace, electrical and computer engineering, and physics departments) ranging from an introduction to aerospace engineering to spacecraft design, spacecraft communications, and space physics. Students participate in courses that include orbital mechanics, space dynamics, spacecraft engineering, and space systems. Senior capstone project work is also included. A separate Astronautics Engineering track as well as a Minor in Space Systems Engineering for non-aerospace engineering students is currently being developed. A, number of student-driven space systems projects are in process that involve design, development, and test of small satellites similar to those recently highlighted in the March 2009 Systems article entitled The First one Hundred University-Class Spacecraft 1981 - 2008. Reference identifies student spacecraft launched over the past 27 years.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "12", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Oct. 2009", "inspec": "10964841", "date": "Oct. 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Nov 06 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "10", "pages": "12 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Sanjay Jayaram"], "keywords": ["aerospace engineering", "educational courses", "educational institutions", "engineering education", "research and development", "space vehicles", "Saint Louis University", "aerospace engineering education", "commercial aviation", "defense systems", "orbital mechanics", "space dynamics", "space physics", "space systems", "spacecraft communication", "spacecraft design", "spacecraft engineering", "Aerospace engineering", "Computer science education", "Design engineering", "Educational institutions", "Electrical engineering computing", "Engineering profession", "Physics education", "Space vehicles", "Systems engineering and theory", "Systems engineering education", ""], "arnumber": "5317779"}
