Interpersonal trust represents the willingness of individuals to accept vulnerabilities from the actions of others. Vulnerability is a critical aspect of trust research, yet few studies have manipulated vulnerability. Non-verbal cues may have an influence on the trust process, suggesting that features of collaborative tools may influence how individuals build trust. The present study will implement a 3 times 4 mixed design. Participants will select a convoy route based on: middot (1) graphical displays of enemy zones and historical improvised explosive device (lED) occurrences; middot (2) route parameters (e.g., fuel required); and middot (3) information from a local expert. Vulnerability will be manipulated by altering the frequency of IEDs and the location of \"red forces\" to create low, moderate, and high vulnerability conditions (within subjects factor). Information from local experts will be presented via one of four conditions: middot (1) audio/video with low emotion; middot (2) audio/video with high emotion; middot (3) audio only; and middot (4) chat (between subjects factor). Findings from this research will support the development of new collaborative tools for the Command and Control (C2) domain.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "36", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "41", "date_publication": "Oct. 2009", "inspec": "10964844", "date": "Oct. 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Nov 06 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "10", "pages": "36 - 41", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Joseph Lyons", "Charlene Stokes", "David Garcia", "Justin Adams", "Dave Ames"], "keywords": ["Java", "decision making", "groupware", "interactive systems", "military computing", "Convoy Leader research platform", "Java-based interactive environment", "audio-with-emotion", "collaborative tool", "convoy route", "decision-making", "graphical display", "groupware system", "improvised explosive device", "lED", "local experts information", "military researcher", "red force", "trust process", "video-with-emotion", "vulnerability condition", "Collaboration", "Collaborative software", "Collaborative tools", "Collaborative work", "Command and control systems", "Decision making", "Fuels", "Military computing", "Software design", "Software tools", ""], "arnumber": "5317785"}
