While change is necessary, the discipline of the systems engineering and development process (requirements, design, implementation, test, delivery, product feedback, and sustainment) can be adversely impacted in the predicament of checking the updated process and/or procedure compliance box. Simplified approaches will be provided to better manage products and teams including discussion of web and database tools. These approaches provide the ability to better understand and manage products in an age of, sometimes, overwhelming circumstances. This identifies simplified solutions, improvement suggestions, and work flow diagrams with key entry points (framework) for new and legacy programs that include: appointment of improvement focals; maximum use of web portals (one-stop shopping); maximum focus on information that is \"need to know,\" and is provided in a simple, database-driven manner (project domain knowledge management); minimum focus on information that is \"nice to know\" but is provided for career advancement; common sense entry points for existing programs by utilizing data obtained from quick assessments and Peer Reviews including standard meeting agendas, intergroup coordination meetings, and common status report templates.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "9", "date_publication": "Oct. 2009", "inspec": "10964839", "date": "Oct. 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Nov 06 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "10", "pages": "4 - 9", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Steve Head", "Bill Virostko"], "keywords": ["knowledge management", "portals", "systems engineering", "workflow management software", "Web portals", "project domain knowledge management", "systems engineering execution", "workflow diagrams", "Databases", "Design engineering", "Engineering profession", "Feedback", "Knowledge engineering", "Knowledge management", "Portals", "Process design", "System testing", "Systems engineering and theory", ""], "arnumber": "5317774"}
