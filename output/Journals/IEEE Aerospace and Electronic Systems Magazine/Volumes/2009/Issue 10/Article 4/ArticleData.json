The P-8A program is one example of a complex software development, with over 2 million lines of code and a unique and complex OMI. The OMI itself is used as a tool for achieving and is designed in parallel with understanding end goals, operator decision making chains, and thought processes. The OMI can be designed to support and anticipate information needs and alert operators to unusual occurrences. Operator actions and decision-making techniques can be discovered by using expert operators and capturing their knowledge through the use of multiple tools to identify the problem set: storytelling, decision mapping, and is/is not matrices. When a solution set has been identified and agreed to by the customer, resources allocated, and schedule set, a standard process captures and prioritizes further changes, identities their impact, and decides on implementation. Documents describing design and processes and a design description document describing the current version of OMI are made accessible to stakeholders at all times.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "Oct. 2009", "inspec": "10974267", "date": "Oct. 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Nov 06 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "10", "pages": "17 - 22", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Patrick Gorman", "Nicolas Pappas"], "keywords": ["aerospace computing", "decision making", "decision support systems", "formal specification", "man-machine systems", "resource allocation", "user interfaces", "OMI", "P-8A program", "aerospace community", "complex software development", "decision mapping problem", "design description document", "expert operators", "is/is not matrices problem", "operator decision making chain", "operator machine interface", "operator requirement", "resource allocation", "storytelling problem", "Aerospace testing", "Companies", "Decision making", "Humans", "Logic", "Marketing and sales", "Military aircraft", "Process design", "Programming", "Resource management", ""], "arnumber": "5317781"}
