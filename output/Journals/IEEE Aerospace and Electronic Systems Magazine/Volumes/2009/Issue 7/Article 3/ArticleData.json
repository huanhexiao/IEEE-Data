The benefits, however, come at the cost of information security vulnerabilities introduced by data networks. Regulatory institutions, including the FAA, are aware that security requirements for network-enabled airplanes must be fully identified. Therefore, this focuses on wireless airplane health monitoring and management, and contributes a security framework to identify threats and system requirements to mitigate these threats. We also present challenges and open problems in enabling secure use of wireless sensor networks for health monitoring and control of commercial airplanes.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "20", "date_publication": "July 2009", "inspec": "10836363", "date": "July 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 18 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "7", "pages": "14 - 20", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Krishna Sampigethaya", "Radha Poovendran", "Linda Bushnell", "M.
