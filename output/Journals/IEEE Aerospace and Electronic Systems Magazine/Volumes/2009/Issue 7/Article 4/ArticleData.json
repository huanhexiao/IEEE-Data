Comprised of physically small, low-power antennas, these networks defeat the Earth curvature blockage that limits today's long-range radar networks and enable high resolution views that extend from the lower-troposphere to the tops of storms. The networks are comprised of 1-meter antennas that transmit 10's of W peak power and are capable of high-speed electronic beam-steering. A system architecture is described that maximizes the value accrued to users of radar data through utility functions that specify dynamic, optimal allocation of resources in response to the needs of multiple end-users and associated information retrieval algorithms.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "July 2009", "inspec": "10836362", "date": "July 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 18 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "7", "pages": "21 - 26", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["David J.
