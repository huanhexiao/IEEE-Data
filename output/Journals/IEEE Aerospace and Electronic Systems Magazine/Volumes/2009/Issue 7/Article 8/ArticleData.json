The main emphasis was placed on compactness in size and high-precise operation in performance. The fabricated radar consists of an FM Gunn oscillator, a balanced mixer, and a planar antenna fed by a leaky NRD guide with a mechanically beam-scanning performance. All circuit components and the antenna were contained in a compact housing of 170 times 140 mm in area and 25 mm in thickness, and thus, a thin type of millimeter-wave radar front-end was successfully developed. Moreover, an error of distance estimation was measured to be less than a distance of 0.7 m.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "42", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "45", "date_publication": "July 2009", "inspec": "10829208", "date": "July 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 18 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "7", "pages": "42 - 45", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Futoshi Kuroki", "Yoshihiko Wagatsuma", "Tsukasa Yoneyama"], "keywords": ["CW radar", "FM radar", "Gunn oscillators", "antenna feeds", "distance measurement", "millimetre wave antennas", "millimetre wave mixers", "nonradiative dielectric waveguides", "planar antennas", "radar antennas", "radar receivers", "radar transmitters", "FM Gunn oscillator", "FM-CW radar front-end fabrication", "balanced mixer", "circuit components", "distance estimation", "frequency 60 GHz", "high-precise operation", "leaky NRD guide", "mechanically beam-scanning performance", "millimeter-wave radar front-end", "planar antenna", "Antenna accessories", "Circuits", "Diodes", "Gunn devices", "Millimeter wave communication", "Millimeter wave measurements", "Millimeter wave radar", "Millimeter wave technology", "Oscillators", "Radar antennas", ""], "arnumber": "5208560"}
