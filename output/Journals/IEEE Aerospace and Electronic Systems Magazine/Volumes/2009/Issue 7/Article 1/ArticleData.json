The efficiency of the network management suit is measured by the number of parameters/components handled by the application while making decisions. In the case of Internet-enabled aircrafts, along with network security, even aircraft safety needs to be considered as a factor while designing the network management suit. This requires the network management suit to monitor/analyze the aircraft-related data (avionics data, physical security parameters, etc.) while determining the proper functioning of the overall system. Herein, these authors present a framework for network management suit that, along with network health, monitors inputs from avionics, video surveillance system, weather monitoring system, and manual pilot alarms, and based on the situation, reconfigures the on-board networking devices to stream appropriate flight-critical data to the ground station. The proposed framework attempts to provide a comprehensive user interface for the flight health monitoring crew with all relevant data.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "9", "date_publication": "July 2009", "inspec": "10829211", "date": "July 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 18 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "7", "pages": "4 - 9", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["N.
