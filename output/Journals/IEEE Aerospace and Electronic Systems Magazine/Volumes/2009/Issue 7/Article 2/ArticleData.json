This is now changing with the recent establishment of an aircraft working group within the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO). The MITRE Corporation's Center for Advanced Aviation System Development (CAASD) has been working over the past year to provide input to the FAA and JPDO which will help inform the avionics evolution and provide more insight into the aircraft equipage considerations for evolving to NextGen.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "10", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "13", "date_publication": "July 2009", "inspec": "10829209", "date": "July 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 18 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "7", "pages": "10 - 13", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Marc Narkus-Kramer", "Ron Stroup", "Jay Merkle"], "keywords": ["air traffic", "avionics", "Center for Advanced Aviation System Development", "FAA", "Joint Planning and Development Office", "MITRE Corporation", "air traffic management operational improvements", "aircraft working group", "avionics", "next generation system", "Aerospace electronics", "Aircraft", "Application software", "Communication standards", "Equations", "FAA", "Flexible manufacturing systems", "Hardware", "Packaging", "Standards development", ""], "arnumber": "5208554"}
