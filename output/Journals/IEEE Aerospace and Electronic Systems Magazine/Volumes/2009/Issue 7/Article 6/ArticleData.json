The work is being performed at Rochester Institute of Technology. This lays the groundwork for an effort to develop a systems level approach for the simulation and analysis of an UNBRaTI system using traditional radio frequency (RF) components as well as micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)-based components. The utility of the approach is its ability to apply sound systems engineering principles and techniques to compare and contrast traditional RF components with MEMS-based components and their effects on system level performance. The simulation has been architected for ease of scalability in order to analyze basic to complex system configurations.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "32", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "35", "date_publication": "July 2009", "inspec": "10829210", "date": "July 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 18 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "7", "pages": "32 - 35", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Steven M.
