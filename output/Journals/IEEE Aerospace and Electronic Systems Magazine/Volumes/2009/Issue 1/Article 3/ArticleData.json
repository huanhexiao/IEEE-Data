It must perform purposeful activities that ensure long-term science and engineering goals are achieved and ensure that it maintains positive resource margins. This requires planning in advance to avoid a series of shortsighted decisions that can lead to failure. However, it must also respond in a timely fashion to a somewhat dynamic and unpredictable environment. Thus, in terms of high-level, goal-oriented activity, spacecraft plans must often be modified due to fortuitous events such as early completion of observations and setbacks such as failure to acquire a guidestar for a science observation. This describes an integrated planning and execution architecture that supports continuous modification and updating of a current working plan in light of a changing operating context.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "Jan. 2009", "inspec": "10470416", "date": "Jan. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 03 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "1", "pages": "23 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Steve Chien", "Russell Knight", "Andre Stechert", "Rob Sherwood", "Gregg Rabideau"], "keywords": ["mobile robots", "planning (artificial intelligence)", "remotely operated vehicles", "space vehicles", "autonomous spacecraft", "changing operating context", "execution", "integrated planning", "Automation", "Costs", "Laboratories", "Moon", "Personnel", "Propulsion", "Solar power generation", "Space technology", "Space vehicles", "Technology planning", ""], "arnumber": "4772751"}
