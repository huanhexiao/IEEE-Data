The Rocketplane XP is a reusable sub-orbital space-plane being designed by Rocketplane Limited, Inc. for the commercial space tourism market. The horizontal take-off/horizontal landing vehicle, which will be one of the world's first true manned aerospace vehicles, has a short development schedule and began operation in 2007. bd Systems performed a detailed trade study to select the navigation subsystem and developed high-fidelity error models for use in the overall vehicle six-degree-offreedom (6DOF) simulation in order to determine the effects of navigation errors on vehicle performance.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "33", "date_publication": "Feb. 2009", "inspec": "10502882", "date": "Feb. 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Mar 06 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "2", "pages": "27 - 33", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Kevin M.
