Naturally, prospective customers of PHM technology ask: \"How will the implementation of PHM benefit my organization?\" Typically, the response by individuals in the field is: \"Anecdotal evidence indicates that PHM decreases maintenance costs, increases operational availability, and improves safety.\" This information helps the prospective customer understand the practical benefits of the technology, but that customer stills needs more information to justify their investment in the technology. The customer needs a calculated return on investment (ROI) figure for their particular asset that provides financial assessment of the benefit of the investment. The data, time, and expertise required to conduct a rigorous cost benefit analysis makes the effort seem daunting to the average engineer with little to no fimancial analysis training. The reality is that with a cursory understanding of the asset operation, maintenance, and logistic issues, a useful cost-benefit analysis can be conducted by engineers without business school training. Our purpose herein is to provide a general methodology for conducting a preliminary cost-benefit analysis that calculates an ROI for PHM implementation. We discuss the general types of information needed for the analysis, the quantifying of expected benefits, and the types of supporting data required to validate the benefit assumptions as well as an outline for the costing of PHM technology.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "22", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "March 2009", "inspec": "10558036", "date": "March 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Apr 03 00:00:00 EDT 2009", "issue": "3", "pages": "22 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Jeffrey Banks", "Karl Reichard", "Ed Crow", "Ken Nickell"], "keywords": ["condition monitoring", "cost-benefit analysis", "investment", "maintenance engineering", "PHM systems", "cost-benefit analysis", "prognostic and health management", "return-on-investment", "Asset management", "Cost benefit analysis", "Data engineering", "Educational institutions", "Information analysis", "Investments", "Logistics", "Prognostics and health management", "Safety", "Technology management", ""], "arnumber": "4811085"}
