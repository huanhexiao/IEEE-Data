The compression feasibility and potentiality of telemetry data are examined by analyzing the statistical characteristics of actual telemetry data recovered from recorders. Aiming at the disadvantage of present data formats in data compression for multi-channel telemetry data acquisition systems, this introduces a data packet structure, and a real-time compression algorithm for low complex hardware design. The principles and implementations of data package compression are described. Simulation results show that this technology can meet the requirements of multi-channel real-time data compression with a high compression ratio and a fast compression speed, which possesses great application value.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "28", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "35", "date_publication": "Nov. 2009", "inspec": "11003249", "date": "Nov. 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Dec 04 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "11", "pages": "28 - 35", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Y.
