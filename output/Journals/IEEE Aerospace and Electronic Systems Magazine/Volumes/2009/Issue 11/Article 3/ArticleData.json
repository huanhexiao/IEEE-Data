The most recent advance has been the widespread adoption of active electronically scanned array (AESA) antennas, which has given the system designer unprecendented control of antenna characteristics. However, in common with most conventional radars, even these systems only operate within a limited frequency band. This argues that the next major advance will be the advent of wideband and multi-band systems, thus addressing the major remaining constraint facing the system designer and offering the capability for a step change in the functionality and performance of future systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "16", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "21", "date_publication": "Nov. 2009", "inspec": "11003247", "date": "Nov. 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Dec 04 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "11", "pages": "16 - 21", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
