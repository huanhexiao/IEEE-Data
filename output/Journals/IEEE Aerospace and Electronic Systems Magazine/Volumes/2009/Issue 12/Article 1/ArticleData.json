SELEX Sistemi Integrati intends to face this evolution as a leader by pro-actively supporting and developing its state-of-the-art. One century after the first RADAR \u00c2\u00bfidea\u00c2\u00bf we registered the Nanotechnology Optical Detection And Ranging (NODAR) trademark. Such NODAR, by including both photonic and nanotechnologies, aims to implement multi-functional, multi-role, multi-domain sensors, as well as adaptive, flexible, knowledge-based sensors. NODAR requires pro-active studies and developments on: nanotechnology vacuum tube amplifiers (TX reverse nano triode): wide bandwidth Tx-Rx optical beam-forming network by means of optical modulator, combiner, analogue optical receive and programmable true time delay; broadband photonic analogue to digital converters; thermal management and interconnection by means of carbon nanotubes; and nanotechnology infrared and chemical state-of-the-art sensors.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "Dec. 2009", "inspec": "11147908", "date": "Dec. 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Jan 22 00:00:00 EST 2010", "issue": "12", "pages": "4 - 10", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
