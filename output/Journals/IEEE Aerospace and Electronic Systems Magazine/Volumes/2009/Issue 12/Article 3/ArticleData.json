The main characteristic of the new radar system is the possibility of simultaneously measuring the (static or dynamic) displacement of several points of a structure with high sensitivity. This describes the major characteristics of the microwave interferometer and its application to ambient vibration testing of full-scale bridges.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "24", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "Dec. 2009", "inspec": "11133759", "date": "Dec. 2009", "date_current_version": "Fri Jan 22 00:00:00 EST 2010", "issue": "12", "pages": "17 - 23", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["G.
