Applications can be divided into two main sectors according to the frequency range used. For the conventional UWB radar microwave region: cardiac biomechanics assessment; chest movements assessment OSA (obstructive sleep apnoea) monitors; soft-tissue biomechanics research; heart imaging (\"Holter type\" echocardiography); chest imaging. Together with systems for: cardiac monitoring; respiratory monitoring; SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) monitor; vocal tract studying. If an IR laser diode is used as the antenna, a more common radar is obtained (actually a hybrid between a narrow band and a wide band radar) which emits a short packet of electromagnetic waves whose echoes are sampled using conventional UWB receiver equipped with a PIN photodiode. Possibilities include: non-invasive biochemical study of soft tissues, non-invasive study of metabolic processes, and IR spectral imaging", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "Jan 2002", "inspec": "7156908", "date": "Jan 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "13 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["E.
