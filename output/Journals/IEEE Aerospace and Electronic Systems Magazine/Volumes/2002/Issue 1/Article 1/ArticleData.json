Using open industry standard software architectures such as Virtual Instrument Software Architecture (VISA), and Interchangeable Virtual Instruments (IVI), developers are able to create systems with interchangeable test instrumentation. This paper describes the VISA and IVI software standards and demonstrates how their use within a broader software architecture, which includes standard development environments and flexible test executive software, facilitates the creation of interchangeable test systems", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "Jan 2002", "inspec": "7156910", "date": "Jan 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "27 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
