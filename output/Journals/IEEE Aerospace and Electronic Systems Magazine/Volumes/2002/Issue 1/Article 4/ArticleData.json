He has the support of the Secretary of Defense, sizeable groups in Congress and the public who feel strongly that the US should have a means to provide protection against that threat, and the US has the technology to create that means. The author presents an overview of the perceived need for deploying such an NMD system which would entail the scrapping of existing ABM treaties", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "Jan 2002", "inspec": "7156907", "date": "Jan 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "4 - 12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
