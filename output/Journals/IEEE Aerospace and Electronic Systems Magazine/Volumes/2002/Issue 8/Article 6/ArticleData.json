These applications require high reliability that justifies the cost of thorough qualification testing, production control, acceptance testing of every cell, and tracking every cell by its serial number through its lifetime. Electric vehicle developments ranged from electric scooters for commuting to work in Europe to electric cars connected to the electric grid when not being driven. Availability of their battery energy for carrying load peaks is so valuable that the electric utility being supported could offer to replace the vehicles batteries whenever they wear out, with no cost to the car owner.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "34", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "39", "date_publication": "Aug 2002", "inspec": "7369317", "date": "Aug 2002", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 07 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "34 - 39", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["H.
