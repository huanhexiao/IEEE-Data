This paper describes a digital avionics systems research facility known as the Digital Information Facility (DIF) developed to provide researchers with the ground systems and air-to-ground interfaces needed to conduct and document experiments involving a mix of new technologies within the existing NAS infrastructure. The DIF supports four NAS functions: Controller Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC), Flight Information Services (FIS), Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) navigation, and Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B). The DIF also includes the capability to record pilot and air traffic management interactions and document research participant observations. The DIF capability includes connectivity to flight test and simulated aircraft in a fully immersive Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance (CNS) environment.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "Aug 2002", "inspec": "7369312", "date": "Aug 2002", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 07 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "4 - 10", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
