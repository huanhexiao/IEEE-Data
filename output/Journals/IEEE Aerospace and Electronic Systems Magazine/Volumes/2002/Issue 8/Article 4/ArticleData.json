Starting from the introduction of development requirements and environment for the monitoring system, the paper discusses its hardware configuration and software functionalities, in detail. Practical application has demonstrated that the virtual instrument-based structure is very effective and the obtained monitoring system is highly flexible.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "15", "date_publication": "Aug 2002", "inspec": "7369313", "date": "Aug 2002", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 07 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "11 - 15", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["O.
