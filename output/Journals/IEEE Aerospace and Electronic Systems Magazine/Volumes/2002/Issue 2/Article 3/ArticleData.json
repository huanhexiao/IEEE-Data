Ground penetrating radar is deployed today from the space shuttle, aircraft, on the surface, in and between boreholes and sometimes from within or between mine shafts. The author discusses these applications and some of the problems involved", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "12", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "20", "date_publication": "Feb 2002", "inspec": "7192344", "date": "Feb 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "12 - 20", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["G.
