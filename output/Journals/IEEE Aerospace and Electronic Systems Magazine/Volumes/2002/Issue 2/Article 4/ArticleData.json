These measurements were performed by integrating two separate X-band radars into one system with the ability to simultaneously track and image aircraft. Selected processed data from both radar systems were analyzed and are presented for the airborne jet aircraft", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "Feb 2002", "inspec": "7192345", "date": "Feb 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "21 - 26", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["B.
