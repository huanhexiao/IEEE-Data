This technology was originally developed for the US Air Force to detect buried unexploded ordnance (UXO). Bakhtar Associates developed the US Air Force EarthRadar technology under the DoD SBIR program. The system is capable of detecting buried metallic and non-metallic objects, including glass vials. In addition, the manner in which system hardware, signal processing, and the integrated high resolution global positioning system (GPS) are configured makes it ideal for applications such as mapping subsurface geological features, locating cavities and collapse features, and identifying contaminated ground", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "11", "date_publication": "Feb 2002", "inspec": "7192343", "date": "Feb 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "4 - 11", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["K.
