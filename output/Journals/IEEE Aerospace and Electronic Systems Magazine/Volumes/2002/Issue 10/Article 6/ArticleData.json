There are currently many weapons platforms trying to achieve this function; however, each platform is developing their own solution to meet individual needs. The Army as a whole needs to standardize on a single path forward to ensure that all systems can communicate across the digitized battlefield, allow for each platform to have a \"common picture,\" and promote software reuse across the Army. Once this \"common picture\" is achieved, the armed forces will have the information needed to continue domination of the battlefield.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "7", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "Oct 2002", "inspec": "7415089", "date": "Oct 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "7 - 12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
