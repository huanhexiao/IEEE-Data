Lithium-ion cells and batteries are often shipped as cargo aboard passenger aircraft. This paper provides an overview of cargo hold configurations and fire suppression systems in passenger aircraft. Next, ways in which a cargo hold fire might affect a shipment of lithium-ion cells or batteries, and the degree to which the cells or batteries might interact with a fire are discussed. Finally, the results of FAA simulated cargo hold fire testing are presented and discussed in the context of lithium-ion cell or battery shipments.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "Oct 2002", "inspec": "7415092", "date": "Oct 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "23 - 28", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
