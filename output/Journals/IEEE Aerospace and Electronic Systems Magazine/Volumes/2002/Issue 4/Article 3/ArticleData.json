Initially known as BETS - Better Engineering Talent for Schools - it did not take long to evolve into JETS, the name that has been used to serve the pre-college engineering community for over fifty years. JETS has, however, respected its heritage through its motto: better talent for engineering. JETS is the only academic program at the high school level (Grades 9-12) that focuses completely on developing \"real-life\" engineering teamwork and necessary engineering problem-solving skills. JETS is working with more than thirty thousand students and their teachers with programs that are in use throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "9", "date_publication": "Apr 2002", "inspec": "7234169", "date": "Apr 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "4", "pages": "4 - 9", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["H.
