Early FBW systems, such as on the F-16 and Airbus A320, were considered revolutionary and introduced with extreme caution. These early systems and their successors all make use of redundant and fault-tolerant avionics to provide the required dependability and safety, but have used significantly different architectures. This paper examines the different levels of criticality and fault tolerance required by different types of avionics systems, establishes architectural categories of fault-tolerant architectures, and identifies the discriminating features of the varied approaches. Examples of discriminators include the level of redundancy, methods of engaging backup systems, protection from software errors, and the use of dissimilar hardware and software. The strengths and weaknesses of the approaches will be identified. The paper concludes with some speculation on trends for future systems based on this evaluation of previous systems", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "Apr 2002", "inspec": "7240984", "date": "Apr 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "4", "pages": "17 - 25", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
