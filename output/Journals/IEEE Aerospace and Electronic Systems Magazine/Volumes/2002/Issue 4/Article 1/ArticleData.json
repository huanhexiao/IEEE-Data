The SIGI is being used for various space vehicle applications such as launch vehicles, orbital vehicles, and re-entry vehicles. This paper describes current space vehicle navigation capabilities. The SIGI is being enhanced to provide additions to these existing capabilities with such items as higher processing and a commercial-off-the-shelf operating system. This will allow hosting of various software applications such as advanced navigation functions, flight control, guidance and vehicle management algorithms. The SIGI can host redundancy management functions by incorporating a cross channel data link card (CCDL) using a high speed firewire bus. The SIGI can then be used as a redundancy management platform which has application to current space vehicle avionics topologies incorporating distributed processing architectures", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "26", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "33", "date_publication": "Apr 2002", "inspec": "7234171", "date": "Apr 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "4", "pages": "26 - 33", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
