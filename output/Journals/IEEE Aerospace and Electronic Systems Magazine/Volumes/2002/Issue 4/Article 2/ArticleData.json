This paper will cover topics relevant to vehicle health management for current and anticipated support environments. It reflects current projects underway at the Air Force Research Laboratory in the air vehicles and human effectiveness directorates. Specifically, the predictive failures and advanced diagnostics (PFAD) for legacy aircraft, passive aircraft status system (PASS), and the space operations vehicle integrated system (SOVIS) projects will be discussed", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "10", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Apr 2002", "inspec": "7234170", "date": "Apr 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "4", "pages": "10 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
