The key to a successful program has proven to be investing time during the proposal stage and at contract award to clearly define the COTS deliverables and the level of detail of required data. This requires discipline from the supplier (engineering, sales, and the proposal team) as well as the procuring agency to agree that the time investment is worthwhile. This paper examines the problem and outlines proven strategies in managing this gap.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "6", "date_publication": "Dec 2002", "inspec": "7485181", "date": "Dec 2002", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 06 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "12", "pages": "3 - 6", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
