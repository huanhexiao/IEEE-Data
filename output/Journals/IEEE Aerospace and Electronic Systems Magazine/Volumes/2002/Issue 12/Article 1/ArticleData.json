There have been recent improvements made to the GPS receivers that include the addition of extra GPS satellite channels that can be tracked simultaneously. The older style GPS receivers were only able to handle five channels at a time. In order for proper determination of three-dimensional position, a minimum of four channels was required and the fifth channel of the receiver was reserved to perform search functions for finding the next satellite. This included searching for satellites that could be used to replace exiting satellites moving out of the Field of View (FOV). The search function also enables the GPS receiver to search for the best constellation for maximum performance accuracy. The fifth roaming channel also provided a best next-satellite selection capability in case the field of view to one of the satellites was blocked or shaded.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "7", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "Dec 2002", "inspec": "7495966", "date": "Dec 2002", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 06 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "12", "pages": "7 - 10", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
