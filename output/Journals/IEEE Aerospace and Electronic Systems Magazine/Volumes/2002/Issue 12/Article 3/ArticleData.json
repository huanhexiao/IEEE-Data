This is a review of the basic technology involved in MMW imaging and some of the programs and products that might benefit from passive day or night imaging through mist, haze, fog, clouds, smoke and/or dust. Potential applications include UAV surveillance of ground vehicles, airborne approach to airfields, tankers, flight leaders, and detection of airborne targets, including stealth aircraft.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "15", "date_publication": "Dec 2002", "inspec": "7485182", "date": "Dec 2002", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 06 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "12", "pages": "11 - 15", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["W.
