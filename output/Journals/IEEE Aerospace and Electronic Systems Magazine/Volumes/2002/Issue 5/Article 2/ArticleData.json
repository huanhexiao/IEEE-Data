Towards specification of operational scenarios", "abstract": "In order to offer an increasing number of equipment access to the electromagnetic spectrum, the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) increasingly authorises the sharing of bands. This will inevitably result in a risk of unintentional friendly interference. The electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of equipment will no longer be based on the sole shape of transmitted spectra. As a result the compatibility has to be previously estimated using realistic scenarios of dynamic electromagnetic environment, the latter forming an essential part of EMC", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "9", "date_publication": "May 2002", "inspec": "7277718", "date": "May 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "4 - 9", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
