Unfortunately, an environment of rapid technological growth breeds a corresponding environment of rapid technological obsolescence. Test systems developed fifteen years ago are becoming increasingly more difficult to support due to obsolescence issues and, additionally, such a test system does not reflect the current state-of-the-art for automatic test equipment. The ability of a test system to evolve is essential to providing cost-effective support systems for electronic systems. The F-15 Tactical Electronic Warfare System (TEWS) Intermediate Support System (TISS) was developed under the Modular Automatic Test Equipment (MATE) guidelines to support the suite of F-15 electronic warfare LRUs. MATE imposed hardware architecture constraints, which were factors that contributed to its abandonment. However, the modular aspect of MATE has provided a system that can easily evolve with technological advancements. Modularity is the cornerstone of modern software systems and this is the aspect that has been exploited in the evolution of the TISS", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "20", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "May 2002", "inspec": "7271045", "date": "May 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "20 - 25", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
