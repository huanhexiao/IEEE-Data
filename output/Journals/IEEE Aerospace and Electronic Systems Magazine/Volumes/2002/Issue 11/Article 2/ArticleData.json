Speech recognition was a key element in the air traffic controller (ATC) workstation used to support a Controller-Pilot Data Link Communications (CPDLC) system. Our work, under the direction of the Avionics Engineering Center at Ohio University, was in support of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Runway Incursion Reduction Program (RIRP) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Runway Incursion Prevention System (RIPS) conducted at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport (DFW). This paper examines the challenges and opportunities of developing voice recognition software solutions in ATC workstations using multiple dialects and accents, complex and varied grammars and terminology, accuracy, hardware restrictions, and user-training procedures.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Nov 2002", "inspec": "7458463", "date": "Nov 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "11", "pages": "11 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
