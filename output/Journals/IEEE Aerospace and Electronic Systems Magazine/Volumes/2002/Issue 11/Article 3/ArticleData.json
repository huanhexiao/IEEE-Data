Functional test methodology tests a unit by simulating its environment and verifying that the unit operates correctly in that environment. This requires simultaneous stimulus and measurement capability not usually found in traditional military ATE. Boeing Support Systems is currently in the process of augmenting an existing military test station to provide functional test capability through the use of NxTest technology. This paper will discuss our approach to adding functional test capability to an existing piece of equipment.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "20", "date_publication": "Nov 2002", "inspec": "7458464", "date": "Nov 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "11", "pages": "17 - 20", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
