One of the major lithium-ion cell manufacturers, GP, introduced GP L210, the UL-certified 18650-cell into the market in 2001. The major evaluation results of this product including the cycle life, rate capability from room temperature to -30\u00b0C at various rates, high temperature stability, UL overcharge, impact, crush, flaming particle, and 150\u00b0C oven test are reported. Test results confirm that GP L210 not only obtains the highest cell capacity in the existing market, but also achieves a high abuse tolerance.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "7", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "Nov 2002", "inspec": "7458462", "date": "Nov 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "11", "pages": "7 - 10", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Jiang Fan"], "keywords": ["battery charge measurement", "impact testing", "life testing", "reliability", "secondary cells", "thermal stability", "-30 to 20 degC", "150 degC", "GP L210", "Li", "UL overcharge", "abuse tolerance", "cell capacity", "crush", "cycle life", "flaming particle", "impact", "lithium-ion 18650-cell", "oven test", "rate capability", "temperature stability", "Batteries", "Circuit testing", "Gold", "Integrated circuit testing", "Life testing", "Manufacturing", "Ovens", "Satellites", "Temperature", "Voltage", ""], "arnumber": "1047372"}
