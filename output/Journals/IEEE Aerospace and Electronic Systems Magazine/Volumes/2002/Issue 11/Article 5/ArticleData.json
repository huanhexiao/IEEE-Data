WSOA provides an open systems \"bridge\" between legacy embedded mission systems and off-board C3I sources and systems. This \"bridge\" is used to support Internet-like connectivity between command and attack nodes. The foundation of this bridge is the creation of a Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) layer over Link 16. In addition, application of quality of service techniques and resource management technologies will ensure the timely exchange and processing of mission critical information by both attack and command nodes in even the most time-sensitive situations.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "Nov 2002", "inspec": "7458465", "date": "Nov 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "11", "pages": "21 - 25", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
