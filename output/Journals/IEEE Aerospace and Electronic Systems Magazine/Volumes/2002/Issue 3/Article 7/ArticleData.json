This means that both construction and testing specifications are constantly being modified; and it also means that products can change rapidly and affect the test requirements. Moreover, the devices, by themselves, are very complicated tangles of hardware and software issues; thus, the test automation is a great challenge. We present herein an effective proposal for leverage of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) for building a system modifying the actual test process in testing of telecommunication (TLC) products development phase. Starting from the analysis of the state-of-the-art in testing, we propose an environment addressed to assist the test planning, description, execution, and results analysis. In this paper, we present ideas and preliminary results of a project carried on by our university in co-operation with the system proving division of a leader company in the field of TLC", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "21", "date_publication": "Mar 2002", "inspec": "7215024", "date": "Mar 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "17 - 21", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
