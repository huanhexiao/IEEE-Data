Some features standout from such future services: security (guaranteeing user's privacy while in operation) in human-machine interacting (thus offering the same degree of spontaneity found in human communication through speech). To deal with security problems, the use of biometric-based technology (specifically through face, fingerprint, and speech) is proposed, because those technologies have reached a high degree of maturity, such as allowing successful application on secure authentication", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "7", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "Mar 2002", "inspec": "7234167", "date": "Mar 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "7 - 10", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["V.
