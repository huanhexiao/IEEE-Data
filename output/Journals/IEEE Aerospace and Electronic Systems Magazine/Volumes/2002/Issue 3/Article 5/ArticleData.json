Of particular interest is the power incident upon various avionics receivers in an aircraft flying low over an urban environment. Taking into account the shielding effectiveness (SE) of the floors and ceilings in office buildings, it will be shown that thousands, if not tens of thousands, of emitters can operate before reaching the sensitivity levels of these avionics", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Mar 2002", "inspec": "7215023", "date": "Mar 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "11 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
