EADS uses its test support system AIDASS (Advanced Integrated Data Acquisition and Stimulation System) in different phases of the aircraft life cycle. AIDASS is comprised of a real-time front-end system and a standard PC for the user interface. The EADS test support system is used in almost all phases of the aircraft life cycle, for instance, for integration and verification testing, as aircraft ground equipment, for in-service software maintenance and training of ground crews. This test support system is used for the software maintenance in the TORNADO program at different airforces in Europe. The airforces also share test setups with industry", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "Jul 2002", "inspec": "7331552", "date": "Jul 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "14 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["E.
