As an example, the development of the computer model of the Space Shuttle Electric Auxiliary Power Unit (EAPU) is discussed. The integrated model consists of power source, electric power distribution and control (EPD&C), and mechanical and hydraulic loads. The modeling and analysis results, model interface issues, EPD&C interactions with the power sources, and EPD&C interaction with the electro-hydraulic load are discussed . The selected computer tool facilitates the development of \"submodel\" corresponding to the subsystem in the integrated system. This modeling approach and the models developed for EAPU can be generalized and adapted for the detailed modeling, simulation, and analysis of other aerospace and commercial electro-mechanical systems", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "Jul 2002", "inspec": "7331550", "date": "Jul 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "4 - 8", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["S.
