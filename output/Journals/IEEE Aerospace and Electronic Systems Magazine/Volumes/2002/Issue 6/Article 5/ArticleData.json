This has resulted in a worldwide search for alternatives to the high-powered gasoline fueled automobiles in wide use today. Replacing gasoline-powered cars with electric and hybrid-electric vehicles has become the most popular tool for reducing carbon-dioxide emissions into our atmosphere. Evaluation of electric alternatives to gasoline-engine propulsion of cars covers such topics as the efficiency, weight, and lifetime of fuel cells, and increasing the charge/discharge life of the new lightweight lithium and nickel metal-hydride batteries. A summary of the work currently being carried out on battery and hybrid vehicles is included here", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "30", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "35", "date_publication": "Jun 2002", "inspec": "7310627", "date": "Jun 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "30 - 35", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["H.
