Unfortunately, nowadays some hackers appear to have demonstrated the lack of security involved in some applications where Integrated Circuit Cards (ICC) have been used. This has led to the opinion that smart cards are not secure enough, and their security is only in the minds of the commercial companies involved with the technology. In this paper, the author explains the reasons why this hacking has succeeded. For example, sometimes memory cards have been used instead of smart cards, or very old smart cards have been issued and not renewed, or the development team involved has not used basic security techniques, such as diversified keys. The author also gives clues to achieve a high level of security depending on the final application, and the environment in which it is going to be used", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "Jun 2002", "inspec": "7303593", "date": "Jun 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "4 - 8", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
