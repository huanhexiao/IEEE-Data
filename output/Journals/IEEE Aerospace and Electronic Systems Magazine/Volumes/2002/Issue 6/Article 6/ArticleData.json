By means of these algorithms we compare fine resolution C- and X-band SAR measurements over the same area to understand what useful information can be derived from these measurements. In addition we examine the similarities and differences of these data sets that are acquired with different frequency bands, bandwidths, and radar look direction. These data sets are recorded over Los Angeles, California, by the C-band NASA/JPL AIRSAR system, and by X-band Intermap Star-3i system. We analyze the original range measurements as reconstructed after the phase unwrapping procedure, the bald earth topography that we were able to retrieve, and the 3D shapes of some of the buildings in the UCLA area. Our results show that both data sets provide useful information of urban 3D characteristics. The better ground resolution of the X-band system results in better building shape extraction. Lower resolution of the C-band data, surprisingly, was not a limiting factor for extraction of large building structures. We demonstrate that it is possible to extract the terrain elevation model (bald earth topography), and the heights of large building structures by means of our algorithms", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "15", "date_publication": "Jun 2002", "inspec": "7310626", "date": "Jun 2002", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "9 - 15", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
