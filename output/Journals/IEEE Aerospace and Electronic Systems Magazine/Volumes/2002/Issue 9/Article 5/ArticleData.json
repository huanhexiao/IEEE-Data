This system has been studied using FEM (NASTRAN) and the results have been verified by the electro-thermic analogy and the FDM method, using, respectively, SPICE and MATLAB codes. The simulation results demonstrated the feasibility of SMART systems for aerospace applications such as attitude control and deorbiting missions for small satellite station-keeping. A theoretical impulse of 20 mNs has been calculated for the SMART system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "22", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "27", "date_publication": "Sep 2002", "inspec": "7415085", "date": "Sep 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "22 - 27", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["L.
