This article examines this transformation from a systems perspective. The trade-offs between centralized and decentralized architectures are identified, the enabling technologies are discussed in detail, and the political challenges of building such a system are examined. The article concludes with some strategies for coping with the political challenges of building a complex system-of-systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "28", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "32", "date_publication": "Sep 2002", "inspec": "7415086", "date": "Sep 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "28 - 32", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
