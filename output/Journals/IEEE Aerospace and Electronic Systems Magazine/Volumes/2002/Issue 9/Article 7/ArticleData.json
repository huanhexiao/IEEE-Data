The three most promising types of fuel cells being evaluated for electric vehicle propulsion are: (1) direct hydrogen-consuming fuel cells; (2) methanol-consuming fuel cells; and (3) zinc-air fuel cells. The author evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of each type.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "33", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "37", "date_publication": "Sep 2002", "inspec": "7415087", "date": "Sep 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "33 - 37", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["H.
