An update of validation test results confirming the breakthrough in the low-Earth-orbit (LEO) cycle life of nickel-hydrogen cells containing 26% KOH electrolyte is presented. The results are part of an investigation of the effect of KOH concentration on life cycle. The cycle life of boiler plate cells was about 40000 LEO cycles compared to 3500 cycles for cells containing 31% KOH. The cycle regime was a stressful accelerated LEO, which consisted of a 27.5 min charge followed by a 17.5 min discharge (2\u00d7normal rate). The depth-of-discharge (DOD) was 80%. The cell temperature was maintained at 23\u00b0C. Results for six 48-Ah recirculation design IPV nickel-hydrogen flight battery cells currently being evaluated to validate the above findings are reported. Three of the cells contain 26% KOH (test cells), and three contain 31% KOH (control cells). They are undergoing real-time LEO cycle life testing. The 31% KOH cells failed at cycles 3729, 4165, and 11355. One of the 26% KOH cells failed at cycle 15314. The other two 26% KOH cells have been cycled for over 16600 cycles without failure", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "13", "date_publication": "Apr 1992", "inspec": "4219937", "date": "Apr 1992", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "4", "pages": "9 - 13", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
