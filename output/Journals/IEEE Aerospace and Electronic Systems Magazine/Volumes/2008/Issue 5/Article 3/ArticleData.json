Given the broad range of applications, a variety of radar types and technologies have emerged to meet unique needs. This paper discusses about the latest advances on system performance and testing of radar systems. When performing characterization of a radar receiver design, a variety of signals are required to accurately recreate the operational environment. This paper will review the test signal environment needed for evaluation of various modern radar systems. Performance considerations in terms of signal source fidelity and spectral purity will also be investigated.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "20", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "May 2008", "inspec": "9996043", "date": "May 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri May 16 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "5", "pages": "20 - 25", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Vishal Gupta"], "keywords": ["electronic equipment testing", "radar equipment", "radar receivers", "radar receiver design", "radar system testing", "signal source fidelity", "spectral purity", "test signal environment", "Airborne radar", "Automotive engineering", "Doppler radar", "Ground penetrating radar", "Meteorological radar", "Radar applications", "Radar equipment", "Signal design", "Signal generators", "System testing", ""], "arnumber": "4523910"}
