Rad Lab designed essentially all of the microwave radars used in that war. Additionally, it created the fundamental knowledge, theory, circuits, and components used in those systems. GCA (ground control of approach, radar system for landing aircraft at night and in bad weather) was one of several programs in Division 7 - all creations/inventions of Professor Luis Alvarez in the lab.
