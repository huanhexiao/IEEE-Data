The novelty of the radar lies in its large operational bandwidth (11.7 GHz at -10 dB level) combined with high time stability. Detection of respiratory movement of a person in laboratory conditions has been demonstrated. Based on experimental results, human being radar return has been analysed in the frequency band from 1 GHz to 12 GHz. The novel principle of human being detection is considered and verified experimentally.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "36", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "40", "date_publication": "May 2008", "inspec": "9996047", "date": "May 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri May 16 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "5", "pages": "36 - 40", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
