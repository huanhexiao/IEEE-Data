The DoD ATS Framework Working Group (FWG) was established by the ATS ED to create a Framework addressing these objectives. The FWG consists of two sub-groups: Management, that includes members from all of the DoD Services, and Technical. The Framework is made up of key elements and associated specifications and standards that form the open system architecture approach for DoD ATSs. In addition to creating and updating key element definitions, the FWG focuses on identifying commercial ATS related specifications that might satisfy the elements in the Framework. The standards specified in the DoD ATS Framework are documented in the DoD's Information Technology Standards Repository (DISR) and thereby become a mandatory requirement for all DoD ATS acquisitions. The Framework is also being specifically called out in DoD ATS requirements documents so that its standards are incorporated in future DoD ATS acquisitions, such as the Navy's eCASS.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Feb. 2008", "inspec": "9818458", "date": "Feb. 2008", "date_current_version": "Wed Mar 05 00:00:00 EST 2008", "issue": "2", "pages": "11 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Michael Malesich"], "keywords": ["automatic testing", "military systems", "ATS framework", "Department of Defense", "DoD", "automatic test system", "executive directorate", "information technology standards repository", "key element definition", "Automatic testing", "Information technology", "Instruments", "Lakes", "Open systems", "Prognostics and health management", "Standards development", "Standards organizations", "Standards publication", "System testing", ""], "arnumber": "4460726"}
