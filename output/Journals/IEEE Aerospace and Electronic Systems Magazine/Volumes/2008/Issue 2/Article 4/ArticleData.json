Instead, many of these mechanical systems will be replaced with electrical versions. The increasing amounts of electrical power that will be shipped through an aircraft means that it is increasingly difficult to rely on low voltage power systems owing to voltage drop and weight constraints. This discusses the challenges that relate to the safe use of higher voltage systems within aircraft.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "32", "date_publication": "Feb. 2008", "inspec": "9818460", "date": "Feb. 2008", "date_current_version": "Wed Mar 05 00:00:00 EST 2008", "issue": "2", "pages": "25 - 32", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Ian Cotton", "Andrew Nelms", "Mark Husband"], "keywords": ["aircraft power systems", "high-voltage techniques", "higher voltage aircraft power systems", "low voltage power systems", "voltage drop", "Air gaps", "Aircraft propulsion", "Breakdown voltage", "Cotton", "Engines", "Low voltage", "Mechanical systems", "Power demand", "Power system reliability", "Power systems", ""], "arnumber": "4460728"}
