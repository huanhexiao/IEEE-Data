So, it is important to design a functional self-contained hardware in a loop simulation system on the ground for solving the verification of SINS/CNS integrated navigation systems. Aiming at solving the main program, a high precision, versatile and better real-time performance hybrid simulation system of SINS/CNS integrated navigation is presented. The system adopts the design of hardware-functional modularization and software-flow integration, and makes use of a trajectory generator to produce simulated nominal trajectory data which is a uniform reference to signal process, and employs unique time synchronization algorithms to collect actual errors data of inertial sub-system and celestial sub-system. By combining with nominal trajectory data, the data smoothing, all-sky autonomous star map identification and integrated navigation algorithm based on unscented Kalman filtering (UKF), this system can accomplish a lot of system performance testing. It has the features of flexibility and extensibility and can be used to effectively reduce the experimental expense and shorten the development time of integrated navigation system, which is significant for studying algorithm performance, system speciality, and practical application of integrated navigation system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "Feb. 2008", "inspec": "9818459", "date": "Feb. 2008", "date_current_version": "Wed Mar 05 00:00:00 EST 2008", "issue": "2", "pages": "17 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Quan Wei", "Fang Jiancheng", "Xu Fan", "Sheng Wei"], "keywords": ["Kalman filters", "aerospace simulation", "hybrid simulation", "inertial navigation", "SINS-CNS integrated navigation system", "celestial navigation systems", "flight tests", "hardware-functional modularization", "hybrid simulation", "software-flow integration", "strapdown inertial navigation systems", "time synchronization", "unscented Kalman filtering", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Hardware", "Inertial navigation", "Real time systems", "Signal design", "Signal generators", "Signal processing", "Signal processing algorithms", "Silicon compounds", "System testing", ""], "arnumber": "4460727"}
