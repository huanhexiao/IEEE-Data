ISE uses a synergistic combination of leading-edge technologies, including high-performance computing, high-capacity communications and networking, virtual product development, knowledge-based engineering, computational intelligence, human-computer interaction, and product information management. The environment will link scientists, design teams, manufacturers, suppliers, and consultants who participate in the mission synthesis, as well as in the creation and operation of the aerospace system. It will radically advance the process by which complex science missions are synthesized, and high-tech engineering systems are designed, manufactured, and operated. The evolution of engineering design is described along with the shortcomings of current product development techniques. The need for ISE to create high-science payoff missions and aerospace systems at affordable costs is discussed. The five major components critical to ISE and some of their sub-elements are described: namely, human-ISE interaction; infrastructure for distributed collaboration; rapid synthesis and simulation tools; intelligent life-cycle system integration; and cultural change in the creative process. Related government and industry programs are outlined and future impact of ISE on complex missions and aerospace systems is discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "44", "date_publication": "April 2008", "inspec": "9919881", "date": "April 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 22 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "4", "pages": "31 - 44", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Ahmed K.
