A new technology, fiber lasers, may offer all of the needed features at an affordable price. An appealing aspect of the fiber laser is that it does not need a rigid optical bench. Only the output end of the fiber need be held in rigid reference to the optical tracking system. Design, fabrication, and testing of the laser resonator is generally the most expensive and longest lead part of the effort for conventional solid-state lasers. Advances in fiber optic technology and devices mean that the \"fiber laser\" need not be a simple device but may be a complex system employing sophisticated technology, such as wavelength selective Bragg reflectors and nonlinear optical frequency shifters. Three companies have obtained single-mode outputs of 35 - 40 watts single mode at 1.03 - 1.1 mu.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "April 2008", "inspec": "9919880", "date": "April 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 22 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "4", "pages": "25 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["John M.
