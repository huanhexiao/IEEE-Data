Herein, we present an overview of FlexRay and investigate FlexRay's dependability for use as a field bus in the aerospace domain. FlexRay supports all major requirements for integrating systems on a single network, if controllers are deployed with a guardian to achieve good hardware fault coverage. Despite including a guardian, some vulnerability may remain, such as software-induced failures and physical layer properties.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "13", "date_publication": "Sept. 2008", "inspec": "10222602", "date": "Sept. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Sep 30 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "9", "pages": "4 - 13", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Michael Paulitsch", "Brendan Hall"], "keywords": ["aircraft", "field buses", "safety systems", "standards", "FlexRay field bus", "aerospace", "airplanes", "automotive domain", "integrating systems", "networking standard", "safety-sensitive systems", "Aerospace safety", "Automotive engineering", "Bandwidth", "Communication standards", "Communication system control", "Context", "Fault tolerance", "Fault tolerant systems", "Next generation networking", "Protocols", ""], "arnumber": "4635065"}
