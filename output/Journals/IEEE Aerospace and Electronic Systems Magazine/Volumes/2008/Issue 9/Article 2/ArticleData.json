Therefore, data compression becomes more important. The compression feasibility and potentiality of telemetry data are examined by analyzing the statistical characteristics of actual telemetry data recovered from the recorder. Aiming at the disadvantages of present data format In data compression for multi-channel telemetry data acquisition systems, we introduce data packet structure and a real-time compression algorithm for low complex hardware design put forward accordingly. The principles and implementation of data package compression are described. Simulation results show that this technology can meet the requirements of multi-channel real-time data compression with high compression ratio and fast compression speed, which possesses great application values.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "21", "date_publication": "Sept. 2008", "inspec": "10235735", "date": "Sept. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Sep 30 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "9", "pages": "14 - 21", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Yongfeng Ron", "Xiaohua Liu", "Wenqiang Xu", "Wendong Zhang"], "keywords": ["data acquisition", "data compression", "space telemetry", "statistical analysis", "data package compression", "data packet structure", "large capacity memory", "low complex hardware design", "multichannel data compression", "multichannel telemetry data acquisition systems", "real-time compression algorithm", "solid-state recorders", "space telemetry technology", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Compression algorithms", "Data acquisition", "Data compression", "Hardware", "Packaging", "Real time systems", "Solid state circuits", "Space technology", "Telemetry", ""], "arnumber": "4635066"}
