The high-volume, low-cost fabrication potential of organic cells will allow for square miles of solar cell production at one-tenth the cost of conventional inorganic materials. Plastic solar cells take a minimum of storage space and can be inflated or unrolled for deployment. We explore a cross-section of NASA in-house and sponsored research efforts that aim to provide new hybrid technologies that include both inorganic and polymer materials as active and substrate materials. For NASA applications, any solar cell or array technology must not only meet weight and AMO efficiency goals, but also must be durable enough to survive launch and space environments. Also, balance of system technologies must be developed to take advantage of ultra-lightweight solar arrays in power generation systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "41", "date_publication": "Sept. 2008", "inspec": "10222605", "date": "Sept. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Sep 30 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "9", "pages": "31 - 41", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Aloysius F.
