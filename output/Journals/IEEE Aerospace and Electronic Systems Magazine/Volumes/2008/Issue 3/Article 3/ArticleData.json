The vision statement for the Air Force Research Laboratory Cryogenic Technologies Group is to support the space community as the center of excellence for developing and transitioning space cryogenic thermal management technologies. The primary customers for the AFRL cryogenic technology development programs are Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO), the USAF SBIRS (space based infrared) Low program office, and DoD space surveillance programs. This describes a variety of Stirling, pulse tube, Reverse Brayton, Joule-Thomson, and Sorption cycle cryocoolers currently under development to meet current and future Air Force and DoD requirements. The AFRL customer single stage cooling requirements at 10 K, 35 K, 60 K, 150 K, and multi-stage cooling requirements at 35/60 K are addressed. In order to meet these various requirements, the AFRL Cryogenic Technologies Group is pursuing various strategic cryocooler and cryogenic integration options. The Air Force Research Laboratory is also developing several advanced cryogenic integration technologies that will result in the reduction in current cryogenic system integration penalties and design time. These technologies include the continued development of the cryogenic systems integration model (CSIM), 60 K, and 100 K thermal storage units and heat pipes, cryogenic straps, thermal switches, and development of an integrated lightweight cryogenic bus (CRYOBUS).", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "27", "date_publication": "March 2008", "inspec": "9906931", "date": "March 2008", "date_current_version": "Mon Mar 31 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "3", "pages": "18 - 27", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["T.
