The satellite navigation GLONASS/GPS receiver SN-4706 developed by \"KB Navis,\" which is integrated with a small-sized strap-down inertial navigation system (INS), based on micromechanical sensors, and a micromechanical magnetometer are included in the structure of the navigation module. The interface of the module allows receiving the external data from the odometer for INS correction. Processing of the navigation information and management of the module operation is provided by the navigation controller. The navigation module physical interface, formed by the navigation controller, includes UART RS232/422, RS485, GPIO, CAN 2.0 B, I2C, Bluetooth. The software of the navigation module is presented by the following groups of procedures: primary processing, complex processing of the navigation information, integrity monitoring of navigation data, management of module modes, service software. Block diagrams, layout drawings and photos of the developed module are presented. Experimental plots of errors and maps with car tracks in urban environments are presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "20", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "Dec. 2008", "inspec": "10429146", "date": "Dec. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 27 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "12", "pages": "20 - 23", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
