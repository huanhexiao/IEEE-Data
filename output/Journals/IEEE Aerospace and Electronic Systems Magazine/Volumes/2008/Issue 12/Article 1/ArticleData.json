This cryptographic paradigm shift has revealed a void in the knowledge base currently used for implementation of cryptographic space products, because reprogrammability has not been addressed within the defense community. This knowledge gap creates the need for a systems engineering-based process to enable a satellite system to achieve successful compliance with CMI, a process that this paper intends to address. The specific steps in the proposed process to achieve CMI compliance regarding the reprogrammability mandate include a review of existing policy, integration of government infrastructure and products, phasing in of technologies and functions related to reprogrammability, use case development, and requirements development. This process is envisioned as being leveraged on all future satellite systems requiring reprogrammability, including both commercial and government satellites. Additionally, this provides a rationale for a CMI Space Policy that will support future cryptographic development efforts. The goal of the Proposed process is to create a CMI-complant satellite system that does not sacrifice the satellite's mission for the sake of compliance.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "15", "date_publication": "Dec. 2008", "inspec": "10429147", "date": "Dec. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 27 00:00:00 EST 2009", "issue": "12", "pages": "4 - 15", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Joseph D.
