Ferromagnetic objects such as vehicle motors, aircraft engines, and landing gears are detected through their deformation of the Earth's magnetic field. Tests have shown that although the local changes of the Earth's magnetic field are extremely small, the proposed sensing technology is able to detect them reliably. The primary objective of the proposed approach is to provide a complementary surveillance system for existing and future Advanced Surface Movement Guidance and Control Systems (A-SMGCS) at large airports or a cost-effective surveillance solution for monitoring critical areas at medium and small airports. Unaffected by weather conditions, interference and shadowing effects, the system provides reliable position, velocity, and direction information without requiring any equipment in aircraft or ground vehicles. The outcome of a comprehensive market analysis is discussed and test results under real life conditions at two airports are evaluated analytically.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "27", "date_publication": "Jan. 2008", "inspec": "9767644", "date": "Jan. 2008", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 EST 2008", "issue": "1", "pages": "21 - 27", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["K.
