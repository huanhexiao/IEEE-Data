Air transport and aeronautics are seen as key assets for the future of Europe to meet needs of society and to win global leadership. Airports are identified as the future bottlenecks of air transport. Advanced surface movement guidance and control system (A-SMGCS) is seen as a key R&D topic the most promising way to achieve the necessary shift. This paper points out how Italy is addressing the challenge of A-SMGCS implementation and shows the first Italian A-SMGCS test-bed and validation process deployed at Milan-Malpensa.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "Jan. 2008", "inspec": "9901219", "date": "Jan. 2008", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 EST 2008", "issue": "1", "pages": "3 - 12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
