One multi-scale morphological gradient operator is used to detect gradient information. This operator has a very good effect on the detail of the edge location. The result is superior to the traditional method in edge continuity and isotropy. Past approaches have used methods of detection based on motion information and edge information, but this is the first to use a multi-scale morphological gradient operator. The implementation described can operate on lower resolution images under difficult conditions. Novel contributions include: 1. Based on multi-scale morphological gradient operator, this algorithm is robust to noise, object shadow, and illumination. 2. Using interframe difference and only the first two frames, this detection method uses very little computation and is suitable for real-time applications. 3. This method can detect rigid-body or non-rigid-body moving objects among video sequences with complicated backgrounds.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "20", "date_publication": "Jan. 2008", "inspec": "9757379", "date": "Jan. 2008", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 31 00:00:00 EST 2008", "issue": "1", "pages": "18 - 20", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Ou Yang"], "keywords": ["edge detection", "image resolution", "image sequences", "mathematical morphology", "mathematical operators", "motion estimation", "object detection", "video signal processing", "image edge information detection", "image gradient information detection", "image motion information detection", "image resolution", "multiscale morphological gradient operator", "video moving object detection method", "video sequence", "Background noise", "Filters", "Gaussian noise", "Image edge detection", "Image resolution", "Lighting", "Motion detection", "Noise robustness", "Object detection", "Video sequences", ""], "arnumber": "4444484"}
