It describes landing at the lunar sites and methods of communicating data to and from Earth via Comsats or via a Relay Station on the Earth-side of the Moon. It shows the constraints on the location of the observatory if Lagrangian satellites or elliptic lunar-orbiting satellites transmit voice and data to and from Earth. This suggests sequential construction of the sensor array, power supply, and communication equipment. This describes the likely method of landing manned and unmanned payloads during the construction process. It describes the likely revisits to the sites for periodic maintenance. The observatory is technically feasible and awaits a design study to size the lunar equipment and estimate costs and schedules. Precursor missions are suggested to measure radio propagation on the back-side. An Earth-bound Command Center will solicit experiment proposals, archive data, and distribute data to principal investigators.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "B-1", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "B-16", "date_publication": "June 2008", "inspec": "10230165", "date": "June 2008", "date_current_version": "Wed Jul 09 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "6", "pages": "B-1 - B-16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
