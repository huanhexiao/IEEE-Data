Main emphasis was placed on compactness in size and high-precise operation in performance. The fabricated radar consists of an FM Gunn oscillator, a balanced mixer, and a planar antenna fed by leaky NRD guide with a mechanically beam-scanning performance. All circuit components and the antenna were contained in a compact housing of 170 times 140 mm in area and 25 mm in thickness, and thus, a thin type of millimeter-wave radar front-end was successfully developed. Moreover, an error of distance estimation was measured to be less than 0.7 m.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "10", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "June 2008", "inspec": "10230162", "date": "June 2008", "date_current_version": "Wed Jul 09 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "6", "pages": "10 - 12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["F.
