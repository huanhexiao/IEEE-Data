The literature discusses several ways of determining the impostor signature provider, but this takes a different approach - that of the opportunistic forger and his or her relationship to the genuine signature holder. This examines the accuracy with which an opportunistic forger assesses the various traits of the genuine signature, and whether the genuine signature holder believes that his or her signature is easy to forge.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "June 2008", "inspec": "10230163", "date": "June 2008", "date_current_version": "Wed Jul 09 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "6", "pages": "13 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["S.
