With the increasing demands of side bandwidth, longer duration chirp signals in radar systems, digital signal generation, and processing has emerged as a preferred alternative. Design and development of programmable and generic digital waveform generator (DWG) system based on Xilinx Virtex XCV600 FPGA and high-speed DAC is carried out at the Space Applications Center. ISRO is to generate required transmit chirp signal of high time-bandwidth product (~ 1000) for ISO's microwave radar sensor missions. This gives a detailed description of the design requirements, implementation details, salient performance features, and test results of this programmable and generic digital waveform generator (DWG).", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "June 2008", "inspec": "10230166", "date": "June 2008", "date_current_version": "Wed Jul 09 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "6", "pages": "25 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["S.
