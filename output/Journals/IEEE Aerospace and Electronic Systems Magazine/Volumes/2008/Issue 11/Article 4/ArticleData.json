Since then, these vehicles have been widely employed in several applications (road cadastre maps, terrestrial photogrammetry, road sign recognition, etc.) for both commercial and research purposes throughout the world. Many GNSS/INS vehicles which can be equipped in different ways with one or more GPS, inertial sensors, and one or several cameras, have been realized. A characteristic shared by most of these devices concerns the high costs of the sensors, of the realization and of the maintenance. For this reason, a GNSS/INS system, that is suitable for any vehicle, made up of low cost devices (two GPS receivers, an INS, and a camera rigidly placed on a metallic bar), has been designed and built by our research group. Two tests run at different velocities have been carried out to evaluate the reliability of the system. After a presentation of the system, the differences that were witnessed during the application of these calibration methods are explained herein.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "32", "date_publication": "Nov. 2008", "inspec": "10359180", "date": "Nov. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 02 00:00:00 EST 2008", "issue": "11", "pages": "25 - 32", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Mattia De Agostino", "Chiara Porporato"], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "cartography", "inertial navigation", "mobile computing", "road vehicles", "traffic engineering computing", "GNSS system", "GPS receivers", "INS system", "mobile mapping", "road cadastre maps", "road sign recognition", "terrestrial photogrammetry", "vehicle", "Cameras", "Costs", "Global Positioning System", "Land vehicles", "Position measurement", "Road transportation", "Road vehicles", "Satellite navigation systems", "Sensor phenomena and characterization", "Sensor systems", ""], "arnumber": "4693987"}
