Raytheon Company responds to this challenge by following a proven program execution methodology. The methodology includes all program aspects from financial planning to engineering to validation and test. This discusses the engineering team and the role of the mechanical engineer. A radar system is ultimately an assembly of advanced electronics and software. However, the design, fabrication, assembly, integration, and test Of this complex system requires a coherent multi-disciplinary approach. Raytheon, like many contractors, chooses to assemble an integrated product team (IPT) including all engineering disciplines. Mechanical engineering is integral to satisfying performance requirements, performing preliminary and detailed design, transition of the design to manufacturing, and implementation of the hardware in the field. During definition, mechanical engineering assists fundamental architecture development, conceptual design, and requirements development which precludes issues that are sometimes ignored to the detriment of many programs. These design issues include environmental protection, structural stiffness to meet deflection requirements, cooling system capacity to properly remove dissipated heat, manufacturability to control cost, maintainability to enable repair in the field, and transportability. Recognizing and trading off these issues early greatly increases the Probability Of satisfying customer objectives. This discusses the approach Raytheon is taking to ensure an overall multi-disciplinary solution to our design challenges from the perspective of the mechanical engineer.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "33", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "38", "date_publication": "Nov. 2008", "inspec": "10349136", "date": "Nov. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 02 00:00:00 EST 2008", "issue": "11", "pages": "33 - 38", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Wiliam c.
