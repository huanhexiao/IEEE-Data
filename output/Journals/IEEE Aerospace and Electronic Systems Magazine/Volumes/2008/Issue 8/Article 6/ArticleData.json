The results of this analysis are compared with that of the conventional power spectral analysis using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) technique. Our results showed that there is a significant advantage in using the bispectral technique over the conventional FFT technique. This study focuses on the importance of bispectral analysis in applications to atmospheric signals.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "38", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "41", "date_publication": "Aug. 2008", "inspec": "10180246", "date": "Aug. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 26 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "8", "pages": "38 - 41", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["I.
