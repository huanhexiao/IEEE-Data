WiMAX offers the potential of long-range (up to 50 miles) and high bandwidth (up to 50 Mb/s) radio links. Although the new WiMAX standard offers the potential for using smart, adaptive antennas, this functionality has not been implemented. Our design will serve as a common platform for testing adaptive array algorithms including direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, beamforming, and adaptive tracking, as well as complete wireless communication with a WiMAX radio. Heavy emphasis will be placed on ease of implementation in a multi-channel/multi-user environment. In the future, we hope to expand this interface to support dynamic radio channel selection via direct interaction with radio hardware or implementation of a cognitive radio system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "26", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "31", "date_publication": "Aug. 2008", "inspec": "10180244", "date": "Aug. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 26 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "8", "pages": "26 - 31", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Yikun Huang"], "keywords": ["WiMax", "adaptive antenna arrays", "cognitive radio", "direction-of-arrival estimation", "IEEE 802.16d-2004", "WiMAX dynamnic beamforming antenna", "adaptive antennas", "adaptive array", "adaptive tracking", "chip-based components", "cognitive radio system", "direction of arrival estimation", "dynamic radio channel selection", "eight-channel adaptive beamforming antenna", "multichannel-multiuser environment", "smart antennas", "Adaptive arrays", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Antenna accessories", "Array signal processing", "Bandwidth", "Direction of arrival estimation", "Radio link", "Standards development", "Testing", "WiMAX", ""], "arnumber": "4607896"}
