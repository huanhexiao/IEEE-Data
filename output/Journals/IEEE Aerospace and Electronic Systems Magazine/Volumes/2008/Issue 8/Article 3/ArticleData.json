This trend is usually referred to as \"Power-by-Wire\" in the \"More Electric Aircraft\" (MEA) concept and it leads, among others, to the substitution of hydraulic actuators by electro-mechanical actuators (EMA). Its benefits are a decrease in maintenance effort and weight, and an increase in efficiency. However, jamming case obstacles stop the massive use of EMAs in flight-control actuators. The aim herein is to introduce the safety needs of electro-mechanical actuators in aircraft applications, and Its major goal is to present the suitability and reliability of such actuator systems, including electric motors and power converters.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "Aug. 2008", "inspec": "10180243", "date": "Aug. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 26 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "8", "pages": "19 - 25", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
