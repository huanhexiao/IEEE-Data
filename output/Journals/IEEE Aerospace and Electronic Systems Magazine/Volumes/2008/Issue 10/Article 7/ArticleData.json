A near-term Shuttle mission is planned to service and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope to prolong its operating life. The California wildfires were monitored by Earth observing satellites as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Space electronics spin-offs are expected to play a role in solving current energy problems. Over the past 50 years NASA space programs have developed new and improved power sources as well as systems to conserve energy. Battery technology and solar cells continue to improve while their prices continue to drop. More efficient use of energy in our homes and cars can reduce overall demand. Down the road nanotechnology may contribute in yet unknown ways.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "38", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "40", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "inspec": "10302071", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri Nov 07 00:00:00 EST 2008", "issue": "10", "pages": "38 - 40", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": [], "keywords": ["artificial satellites", "remotely operated vehicles", "space research", "Hubble Space Telescope", "Shuttle mission", "aeronautics programs", "unmanned aerial vehicles", "unmanned satellite", "Batteries", "Earth", "Monitoring", "NASA", "Satellites", "Space missions", "Space shuttles", "Space technology", "Telescopes", "Unmanned aerial vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "4667626"}
