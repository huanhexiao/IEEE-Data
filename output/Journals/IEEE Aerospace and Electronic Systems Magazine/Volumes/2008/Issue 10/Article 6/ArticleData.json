The technology provided by NASA would not have been affordable for public service users without this initial support. After being reinstated in 1978, NASA changed direction from public service technology demonstration to R&D support. The plan is to continue commercial communications support at a low level while focusing on the next generation of R&D in spectrum management and interoperability.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "32", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "37", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "inspec": "10302067", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri Nov 07 00:00:00 EST 2008", "issue": "10", "pages": "32 - 37", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": [], "keywords": ["history", "satellite communication", "NASA", "SATCOM", "satellite communications", "satellite technology", "Artificial satellites", "Costs", "Low earth orbit satellites", "Military satellites", "NASA", "Relays", "Satellite broadcasting", "Satellite communication", "Space technology", "Space vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "4667625"}
