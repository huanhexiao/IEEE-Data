The attraction of space had been unfolding for nearly a century in novels; and early experiments with balloons and aircraft stimulated interest across the globe. Advances in rocket propulsion and structures were absolutely vital to accessing outer space; it is unlikely that the space race could have proceeded without these two critical technologies. Although discovered in the late 1 940 s, solid-state electronics remained a curiosity until the military began to use them to reduce the size, weight, and power requirements for their critical systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "inspec": "10302066", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri Nov 07 00:00:00 EST 2008", "issue": "10", "pages": "15 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
