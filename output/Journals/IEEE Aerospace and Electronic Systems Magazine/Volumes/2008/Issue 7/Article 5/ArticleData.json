The proposed approach exploits both range information and azimuth information to estimate fractal dimension. Moreover, the approach can increase the number of data points. The above two merits result in the fractal dimension estimated by this method are more accurate and robust than the previous method. The detection performance is also better than the previous, which only makes use of 1-dimensional (1-D) information to estimate fractal dimension. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed method performs well in a strong clutter background. The proposed method is also validated by real-life radar data, and the better result has been achieved.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "28", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "31", "date_publication": "July 2008", "inspec": "10117958", "date": "July 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri Jul 25 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "7", "pages": "28 - 31", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Pengfei Du", "Yongliang Wang", "Ziyue Tang"], "keywords": ["fractals", "radar clutter", "radar detection", "radar signal processing", "2-dimensional fractal dimension", "radar target detection", "real-life radar data", "strong clutter background", "Azimuth", "Clutter", "Fractals", "Geometry", "Object detection", "Performance analysis", "Radar detection", "Radar imaging", "Robustness", "Stochastic processes", ""], "arnumber": "4579289"}
