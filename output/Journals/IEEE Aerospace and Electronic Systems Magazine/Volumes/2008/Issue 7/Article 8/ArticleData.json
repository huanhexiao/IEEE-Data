This volume combines improved details of the environment along with novel system applications. Each chapter is authored by radar experts who had the vision and motivation to tackle a daunting development problem, and share their view of the successes and remaining implementation challenges. The book is divided into two parts: Bistatic/Multistatic Systems and Bistatic Clutter and Signal Processing. The book is an essential addition to the modern radar engineer's library.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "46", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "46", "date_publication": "July 2008", "date": "July 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri Jul 25 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "7", "pages": "46", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Nicholas J.
