The work is motivated in recognition of the effort of the NOAA off-line engineering support team and their NOAA civil servant mission leads and operations support staff.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "4", "date_publication": "July 2008", "inspec": "10117955", "date": "July 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri Jul 25 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "7", "pages": "4", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Milton C.
