With an attempt to reduce the deterioration, a scientific approach has to be taken to determine their origins. A monostatic LIDAR may be one of the best instruments for such work. The authors are tempted to develop such a LIDAR for fog, mist, and dust particle monitoring over River Teesta at Sikkim. LIDAR is an acronym for Light Detection And Ranging. What can we do with LIDAR? Measure distance, measure speed, measure rotation, measure chemical composition and concentration, and measure cross-sections of the targets. The digital technique is always utilized for its development which results in better security, lower power consumption, higher power efficiency, higher reliability, lower transmitter power, lower multipath effect, higher interference suppression as compared to an analog system. The commercial systems like disdometer, rain radar, mobile robot, etc., utilizing LIDAR principles are operational in different parts of the world. The authors are highly motivated for such LIDAR development and their development effort follows.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "23", "lastpage": "27", "date_publication": "July 2008", "inspec": "10117957", "date": "July 2008", "date_current_version": "Fri Jul 25 00:00:00 EDT 2008", "issue": "7", "pages": "25 - 27", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Rabindranath Bera", "B.
