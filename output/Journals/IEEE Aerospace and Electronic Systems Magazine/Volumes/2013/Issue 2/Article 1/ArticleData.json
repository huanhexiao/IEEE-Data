To guarantee surveillance integrity, it is clear that performance assessments of the different elements of the surveillance system are necessary. Due to the evolution suffered by the surveillance processing chain in the recent past, its complexity has been increased by the integration of new sensor types (e.g., automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast [ADS-B] [1], Mode S radars [2], and wide area multilateration [WAM] [3]), data link applications, and networking technologies. With new sensors, there is a need for system-level performance evaluations as well as methods for establishing assessment at each component of the tracking evaluation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "28", "lastpage": "17", "date_publication": "Feb. 2013", "inspec": "13382556", "date": "Feb. 2013", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 12 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "2", "pages": "4 - 17", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Juan Besada", "Andr\u00e9s Soto", "Gonzalo de Miguel", "Jes\u00fas Garc\u00eda", "Emmanuel Voet"], "keywords": ["air traffic control", "ground support systems", "sensors", "surveillance", "ATC trajectory reconstruction", "air traffic controller", "automated sensor evaluation", "automated tracker performance evaluation", "ground support tool", "surveillance integrity", "surveillance processing", "surveillance sensor network", "system-level performance evaluation", "Data integration", "Noise", "Radar tracking", "Surveillance", "Target tracking", "Trajectory", ""], "arnumber": "6477864"}
