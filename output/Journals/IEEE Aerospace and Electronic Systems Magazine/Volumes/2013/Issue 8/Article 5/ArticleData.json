This enables, with respect to the space segment, the adoption of the goal-based operations paradigm and consequently allows for an increase of the autonomy level. The performance presented by the architecture in a realistic case study is comparable to those reported by the only three NASA missions that have run on-board planning in the space segment up-to-date. A new planning modeling language was created, which allows a description of the operations domain closer to the real system and with few abstractions. The implemented architecture is integrated to the flight software and fit to run in space-qualified hardware with limited processing power.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "32", "volume": "28", "lastpage": "45", "date_publication": "Aug. 2013", "inspec": "13684753", "date": "Aug. 2013", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "8", "pages": "32 - 45", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Fabr\u00edcio de Novaes Kucinskis", "Mauricio Gon\u00e7alves Vieira Ferreira"], "keywords": ["aerospace computing", "artificial satellites", "planning", "software architecture", "specification languages", "INPE satellite", "NASA mission", "autonomy level", "flight software", "goal-based Brazilian mission operation", "goal-based operations paradigm", "on-board planning", "on-board satellite software architecture", "planning modeling language", "processing power", "space segment", "space-qualified hardware", "Aerospace electronics", "NASA", "Satellites", "Software architecture", "Space missions", "Space vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "6575409"}
