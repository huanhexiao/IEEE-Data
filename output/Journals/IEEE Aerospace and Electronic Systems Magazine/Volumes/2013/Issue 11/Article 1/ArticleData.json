This was probably one of the harmonics of the illumination source, as a high transmit power at the lower frequency would have been easier to generate. In addition, the interaction between acoustically introduced vibrations of the diaphragm would generate an AM signal that could be detected remotely.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "28", "lastpage": "11", "date_publication": "Nov. 2013", "inspec": "13950428", "date": "Nov. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Dec 05 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "11", "pages": "4 - 11", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Graham Brooker", "Jairo Gomez"], "keywords": ["acoustic devices", "diaphragms", "military communication", "national security", "radiofrequency identification", "AM signal generation", "Lev Termen great seal bug", "acoustically introduced vibration", "diaphragm vibration", "illumination source harmonics", "passive radio frequency identification", "Antennas", "Cavity resonators", "Frequency modulation", "Harmonic analysis", "History", "Military communication", "RFID tags", "Radiofrequency identification", "Resonant frequency", ""], "arnumber": "6678486"}
