The Matlab program is used as the developing tool. In this platform, the practitioners can investigate the inherent mechanism by applying game theory to solve the mission decision-making problem of multiple UCAVs in attacking multiple objects. This simulation platform is friendly, easy to use, and easy to modify.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "12", "volume": "28", "lastpage": "19", "date_publication": "Nov. 2013", "inspec": "13950427", "date": "Nov. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Dec 05 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "11", "pages": "12 - 19", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Haibin Duan", "Xingxing Wei", "Zhuoning Dong"], "keywords": ["game theory", "military aircraft", "ACO", "Matlab program", "PSO", "cooperative air combat simulation", "game theory", "multiple UCAV", "Atmospheric modeling", "Data models", "Game theory", "Military communication", "Solid modeling", "US Department of Defense", "Unmanned aerial vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "6678487"}
