Promising results have been obtained also in DS sequence SS radar simulations, where the number of available sequences may be important to cope with specific scenarios, such as anticollision vehicular radar applications. The behavior exhibited by De Bruijn sequences motivates the efforts aimed at providing an efficient generation algorithm to obtain the complete set of codes for even greater values of n and performing an exhaustive evaluation of their properties.
