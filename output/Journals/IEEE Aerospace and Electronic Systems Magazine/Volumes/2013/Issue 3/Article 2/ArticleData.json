For the See-Elefant, it could possibly measure V-2 impact points on London, which would aid assessment of V-2 in-flight performance. The former technique is used today by counterbattery radars and the latter by range instrumentation radars.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "28", "lastpage": "19", "date_publication": "March 2013", "inspec": "13429625", "date": "March 2013", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 09 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "3", "pages": "13 - 19", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Hugh Griffiths"], "keywords": ["military radar", "radar detection", "radar tracking", "rockets", "German V-2 rocket launches", "WW2", "radar detection", "radar tracking", "range instrumentation radars", "trajectory backtracking", "Ground support", "History", "Military aircraft", "Military technology", "Radar detection", "Rockets", "Target tracking", "Trajectory", ""], "arnumber": "6495648"}
