The results show that main scattering centers are located at the wheels, the regions around the license plate, door outer panel, windshield pillar, center pillar, rear pillar, and light units. Furthermore, it has been shown that multipath propagation enables an indirect detection of scattering centers. The analysis shows no significant differences between the scattering center locations at 24 GHz and 77 GHz. However, the increased bandwidth at 77 GHz allows resolving merged scattering centers and improves the contour determination. The comparison between the measurement results of the SAR processing and the mechanical scanning radar confirmed similar main scattering centers. Furthermore, the measurement results show that the contour and orientation of a vehicle can be determined at a distance of 10 m with a bandwidth of 2 GHz and an angular resolution of approximately 2\u00b0.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "20", "volume": "28", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "March 2013", "inspec": "13429626", "date": "March 2013", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 09 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "3", "pages": "20 - 25", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
