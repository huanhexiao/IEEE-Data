Comprised of three SDRs from industry partners, CoNNeCT allows experimenters to develop and verify new waveforms compliant with the STRS SDR architecture standard, using verified ground systems and then have those waveforms uploaded to the flight SDRs to assess in situ performance and to better understand operational concepts for SDRs in space. In addition to the SDRs, the reprogrammable avionics software allows application software for on-board networking and routing experiments. The flight system communicates with TDRSS at both S-band and Ka-band and can receive within the GPS L-band for navigation waveform development and experiments.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "28", "lastpage": "15", "date_publication": "April 2013", "inspec": "13474526", "date": "April 2013", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 23 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "4", "pages": "4 - 15", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Richard C.
