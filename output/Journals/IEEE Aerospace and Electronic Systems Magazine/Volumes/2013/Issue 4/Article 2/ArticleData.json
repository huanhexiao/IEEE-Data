Measurement data obtained in the field campaign have been processed to validate the radar performance. Comparisons of the measured radar backscattering cross section between ADPR and TRMM PR over sea and precipitation data between airborne radar and ground-based weather radar/mobile ground-based meteorological radar/TRMM PR have been made to validate ADPR's ability in precipitation detection. Important radar performance indices are evaluated using the field campaign datasets. The overall performance shows the dual-frequency airborne PR is qualified for the development of future dual-frequency spaceborne radar in China. The sensitivities and range resolutions of both Ku-band and Ka-band PRs are satisfying, and the sidelobe in pulse compression mode as well as the dynamic range in short-pulse mode of Ka-band PR can be improved. Future work will focus on furthering the performance analysis and improving the performance indices of the spaceborne PR.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "16", "volume": "28", "lastpage": "27", "date_publication": "April 2013", "inspec": "13474527", "date": "April 2013", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 23 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "4", "pages": "16 - 27", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Jian Shang", "Hu Yang", "Honggang Yin", "Qiong Wu", "Yang Guo", "Ping Zhang"], "keywords": ["airborne radar", "meteorological radar", "performance index", "radar cross-sections", "radar resolution", "spaceborne radar", "ADPR ability", "ADPR over sea", "China dual-frequency airborne precipitation radar performance analysis", "Ka-band PR", "Ku-band PR", "TRMM PR", "TRMM PR over sea", "airborne field campaign dataset", "dynamic range", "ground-based weather radar", "measurement data", "mobile ground-based meteorological radar", "precipitation data", "pulse compression mode", "radar backscattering cross section", "radar performance indices", "spaceborne PR", "Airborne radar", "China", "Meteorological radar", "Radar antennas", "Radar measurements", "Sea measurements", "Spaceborne radar", ""], "arnumber": "6506825"}
