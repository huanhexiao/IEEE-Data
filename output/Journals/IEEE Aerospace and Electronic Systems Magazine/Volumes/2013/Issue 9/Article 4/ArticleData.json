The NATO panel tasks technical teams to investigate specific topics related to the armed forces. This technical team, (SET152), was tasked to study the capabilities of a future type of radar that combines passive and active modes of operation for a better performance in air defence applications. A system concept for a 'deployable multi-band passive active radar' DMPAR was developed, indicating the critical components, proposing solutions, specifying performance expectation, and proposing new approaches for system performance verification.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "37", "volume": "28", "lastpage": "45", "date_publication": "Sept. 2013", "date": "Sept. 2013", "date_current_version": "Wed Oct 02 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "9", "pages": "37 - 45", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Heiner Kuschel", "J\u00f6rg Heckenbach", "Jochen Schell"], "keywords": ["Digital video broadcasting", "Doppler effect", "Jamming", "Military communication", "Passive radar", "Receivers", "Sensors", "Surveillance", ""], "arnumber": "6617097"}
