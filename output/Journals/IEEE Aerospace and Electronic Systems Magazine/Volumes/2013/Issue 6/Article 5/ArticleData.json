This paradigm, termed opportunistic navigation (OpNav), aims to extract positioning and timing information from ambient radio frequency signals of opportunity (SOPs). OpNav radio receivers continuously search for opportune signals from which to draw navigation and timing information, employing on-the-fly signal characterization as necessary. In collaborative opportunistic navigation (COpNav), multiple OpNav receivers share information to construct and continuously refine a global signal landscape.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "38", "volume": "28", "lastpage": "41", "date_publication": "June 2013", "inspec": "13578304", "date": "June 2013", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 17 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "6", "pages": "38 - 41", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Zaher M.
