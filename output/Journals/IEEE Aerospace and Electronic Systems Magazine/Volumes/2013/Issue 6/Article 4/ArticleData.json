Our simplified design enables a reduction in both the cost and the complexity of a PAA. This unique concept reduces complexity by requiring full scan capability only in the azimuth plane, thereby reducing the number of phase shifters from NM to M for each beam. At the same time, only one or two hard-wired squints are used in the elevation plane, further reducing the complexity and thus the cost of development of such a PAA.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "32", "volume": "28", "lastpage": "37", "date_publication": "June 2013", "inspec": "13578303", "date": "June 2013", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 17 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "6", "pages": "32 - 37", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
