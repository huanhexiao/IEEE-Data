As the widely deployed network protocol suite, the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) has been very successful in today's Internet operations. But TCP experiences severe performance degradation in space communications mainly because of the vast differences between terrestrial and space operating environments [2]. Although the feasibility of operating space communications using the Internet type of protocols has been a source of contention within NASA [1], a large number of alternative transmission control protocols and algorithms have been developed for space and other environments with similar communication conditions [2]-[8]. In [9], Wang et al. provides a comprehensive and comparative discussion for some of these protocols.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "28", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "May 2013", "inspec": "13499800", "date": "May 2013", "date_current_version": "Tue May 14 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "5", "pages": "14 - 22", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Qian Yu", "Ruhai Wang", "Zhiguo Wei", "Xue Sun", "Jia Hou"], "keywords": ["Internet", "space communication links", "transport protocols", "DTN Licklider transmission protocol", "IPN", "Internet operations", "NASA", "TCP/IP", "asymmetric space channels", "interplanetary Internet", "national aeronautics and space administration", "network architecture", "network protocols", "space communications", "transmission control protocol/internet protocol", "Aerospace electronics", "Bit error rate", "Channel capacity", "Data communication", "Internet", "Interplanetary", "NASA", "Network architecture", "Propagation losses", "Receivers", "Space exploration", ""], "arnumber": "6516145"}
