Future development will focus on redesign of the airframe platform, the wireless link, and the image processing. UAV flight characteristics need to be better understood and more thoroughly tested to accommodate less-than-ideal flight conditions. Full analyses of the link margin for spectrum management and of risk assessment to handle flight failure/termination events, e.g., loss of data link, GPS, or autopilot, are needed. Overall, the design experience demonstrated systems trade-offs present in a practical vehicle and UAV capabilities even using off-the-shelf component integration. The prototype UAV could be used for aerial mapping, environmental monitoring, and search and rescue at a cost significantly lower than using traditional full-size aircraft for the same missions.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "32", "volume": "28", "lastpage": "37", "date_publication": "May 2013", "inspec": "13499802", "date": "May 2013", "date_current_version": "Tue May 14 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "5", "pages": "32 - 37", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["David Erdos", "Abraham Erdos", "Steve E.
