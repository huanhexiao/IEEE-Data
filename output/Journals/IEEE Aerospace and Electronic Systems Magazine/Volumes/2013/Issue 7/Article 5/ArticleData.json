We accomplish several major preprocessing objectives, such as records-to-ontology event mapping and the resolution of date conflicts in the aggregated records of events.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "30", "volume": "28", "lastpage": "39", "date_publication": "July 2013", "inspec": "13639746", "date": "July 2013", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 15 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "7", "pages": "30 - 39", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Michael Schuh", "John Sheppard", "Shane Strasser", "Rafal Angryk", "Clemente Izurieta"], "keywords": ["IEEE standards", "data mining", "data visualisation", "engineering computing", "graph theory", "maintenance engineering", "ontologies (artificial intelligence)", "IEEE standards", "data record", "filterable visualizations", "knowledge discovery", "maintenance data", "maintenance event sequence", "major preprocessing objective", "ontology based event graphs", "visualization tool", "Data models", "Knowledge discovery", "Maintenance engineering", "OWL", "Object oriented modeling", "Ontologies", "Standards", ""], "arnumber": "6559379"}
