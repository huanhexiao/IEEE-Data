A strong motivation for very wideband operation is continually being justified. However, these new systems are invariably classified as ultra-wide band by the spectrum control authorities. Under that classification, the process to obtain frequency allocation has been significantly complicated. If these new radar capabilities are to be realized for sensing, collision avoidance, and resource monitoring in severe environments, a new design of radar waveform and signal processing is needed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "12", "volume": "28", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "July 2013", "inspec": "13639743", "date": "July 2013", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 15 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "7", "pages": "12 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Mark E.
