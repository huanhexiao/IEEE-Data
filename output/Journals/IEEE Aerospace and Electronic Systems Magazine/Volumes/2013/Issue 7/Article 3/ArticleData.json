The radar standards are essential tools utilized by the radar community to enable clear and concise communication of radar aspects and facilitate the specification and evaluation of radar performance. The AESS Radar Systems Panel (RSP) consists of a group of experts in the field of radar who promote various radar related activities such as the IEEE Radar Conferences, student education initiatives, and many more benefiting the radar community. One of the lesser known RSP activities is the development and maintenance of radar related standards. The two radar standards sponsored by the RSP are the IEEE Standard (STD) 521, IEEE Standard Letter Designations for Radar Frequency Bands [1], and IEEE STD 686, IEEE Standard Radar Definitions [2]. Another radar related standard that is not sponsored by the RSP but includes several RSP members on the working group is IEEE STD 1672, IEEE Standard for Ultrawideband Radar Definitions. The radar standards provide essential tools for radar engineers specifying, developing, and evaluating radar system performance.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "28", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "July 2013", "inspec": "13639744", "date": "July 2013", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 15 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "7", "pages": "19 - 22", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Joseph A.
