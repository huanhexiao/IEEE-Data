Gyros, accelerometers, and inertial systems are used in the military, scientific, automotive, industrial, medical, and consumer fields. With so many different types, grades, manufacturers, and users of inertial sensors and systems, standardization is important. Standards reduce confusion by establishing an accepted way to describe the technology and product. Standards development requires consensus and can lead to interesting stories.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "28", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "July 2013", "inspec": "13639745", "date": "July 2013", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 15 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "7", "pages": "23 - 29", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Randall K.
