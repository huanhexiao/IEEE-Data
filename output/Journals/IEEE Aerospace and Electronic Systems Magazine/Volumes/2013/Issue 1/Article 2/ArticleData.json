Acting as a very small unit C2 system, with the additional benefit of reduced complexity and cost compared with the different BMS currently on the market, one of the key design concepts of the system is its capability of using any communication mean (HF, VHF, and satellite) besides its full software conception. This design makes the system fully independent from the underlying hardware, including the transmission mean.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "28", "lastpage": "21", "date_publication": "Jan. 2013", "date": "Jan. 2013", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "1", "pages": "14 - 21", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Manuel Esteve", "Israel P\u00e9rez-Llopis", "Carlos E.
