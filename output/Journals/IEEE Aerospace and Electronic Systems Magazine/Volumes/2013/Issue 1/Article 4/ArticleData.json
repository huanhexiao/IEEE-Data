Given a complex system and a set of tests or alarm outcomes, the user wants to determine the most likely faulty component. Some of the most common diagnostic algorithms used are rule based, fault dictionaries, and fault trees [2], [3], [4]. Model-based methods provide another common set of approaches to performing system level diagnosis, which compare observations from the system with those expected from a model [5], [6].", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "34", "volume": "28", "lastpage": "43", "date_publication": "Jan. 2013", "date": "Jan. 2013", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "1", "pages": "34 - 43", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Shane Strasser", "John Sheppard"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Bayesian methods", "Fault diagnosis", "Inference algorithms", "Maintenance engineering", "Monitoring", ""], "arnumber": "6470443"}
