With further research, development, and refinement, the design concept of a fuzzy-neural system described in this article provides a basis for the more accurate measurement of signal parameters and types, with the presentation of confidence factors for the resolution of possible ambiguities when sources appear similar under certain circumstances. An area of particular research is that of determining the optimum values or perhaps learning functions to be used for weighting factors and thresholds. Similarly, the concept provides a basis for the better presentation of possible source identifications, based on the signal determinations and the content of data in references of sources.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "22", "volume": "28", "lastpage": "33", "date_publication": "Jan. 2013", "date": "Jan. 2013", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "1", "pages": "22 - 33", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Phillip Fitch"], "keywords": ["Digital signal processing", "Fuzzy systems", "Identification", "Neural networks", "Receivers", "Switches", "Threshold analysis", "Time frequency analysis", ""], "arnumber": "6470441"}
