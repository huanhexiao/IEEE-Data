The several purposes were (i) air defense (monostatic) in the same way as CH but particularly when the conventional radars were jammed or otherwise unusable, and there are several pieces of evidence that it did this quite effectively; (ii) tracking of V-2 rockets; this seems quite plausible, although there is not a great deal of evidence of the effectiveness; and (iii) for bistatic experiments, either using CH transmissions (noncooperative, in the same way as KH) or transmissions from other Elefants. The radars demonstrated some remarkable examples of engineering.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "28", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "Jan. 2013", "date": "Jan. 2013", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 25 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "1", "pages": "4 - 12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Hugh Griffiths"], "keywords": ["Broadband antennas", "Dipole antennas", "Jamming", "Military communication", "Radar antennas", "Receiving antennas", "Transmitting antennas", ""], "arnumber": "6470438"}
