The majority of this research has focused on the design environment and interaction between disciplines to optimize design and save time. In this article, finite burn is inserted in the initial phases of design, and a propulsion system was designed based on this assumption. Results are similar to real and optimum values, with no correction needed. In this way, further validations or corrections of design are no longer needed. In the final phases of design, correcting and changing the design is time consuming. The design environment proposed in this article has demonstrated a dramatic analysis of time savings and presented excellent design outputs. Mass properties, propulsion analysis, and trajectory analysis disciplines are integrated to improve transfer vehicle performance and decrease total mass. This work will be useful for designing optimum and actual space vehicles. The design environment of liquid propulsion upper-stage and multimaneuver transfer vehicles, which have reignite capabilities, will be documented in forthcoming articles.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "36", "volume": "28", "lastpage": "43", "date_publication": "Oct. 2013", "inspec": "13858030", "date": "Oct. 2013", "date_current_version": "Tue Oct 22 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "10", "pages": "36 - 43", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Javad Amiri Motlagh", "Alireza Basohbat Novinzadeh", "Mostafa Zakeri"], "keywords": ["aerospace propulsion", "space vehicles", "trajectory control", "finite burn assumption", "interplanetary missions", "liquid propulsion upper-stage", "multimaneuver transfer vehicles", "optimal control theory techniques", "propulsion analysis", "solid propulsion upper stages", "solid upper stage", "trajectory analysis", "Engines", "Fuels", "Orbits", "Propulsion", "Solids", "Trajectory", "Vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "6642830"}
