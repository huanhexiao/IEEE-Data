The precision of a UFV's electromagnetic sensors generally infuences the accuracy of its guidance. To improve the accuracy of the UFV's guidance system, advanced guidance technologies based on bionic vision have been studied in recent years. Some developments based on bioinspired intelligence [2], [3] have also been investigated for aerial systems. Bionic vision, such as that inspired by the vision of Limulus species (i.e., horseshoe crabs), fruit fies, birds, and humans [4], has become a hot research feld, and some of these new technologies have been applied to missile homing guidance.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "36", "volume": "28", "lastpage": "45", "date_publication": "Dec. 2013", "date": "Dec. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 02 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "12", "pages": "36 - 45", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Haibin Duan", "Yimin Deng", "Xiaohua Wang", "Fang Liu"], "keywords": ["Aircraft navigation", "Aircraft tracking", "Electromagnetic measurements", "Precision engineering", "Sensors", "Tracking", "Unmanned aerial vehicles", "Visual systems", ""], "arnumber": "6693667"}
