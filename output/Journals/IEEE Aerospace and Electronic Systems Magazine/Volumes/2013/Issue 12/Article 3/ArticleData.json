Specifically, IFD Analysis was introduced to model four alternative conflict detection and resolution architectures for airport surface movement. IFD analysis demonstrated that both automated reconciliation and intent information have positive effects on reducing collision risk probabilities. Of the four architectures considered, only Option C (featuring both automated reconciliation and intent information) resolves all major fault conditions.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "26", "volume": "28", "lastpage": "35", "date_publication": "Dec. 2013", "inspec": "14030664", "date": "Dec. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 02 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "12", "pages": "26 - 35", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Frank Saunders", "Jason Rife", "Sai Vaddi", "Victor Cheng"], "keywords": ["aerospace computing", "air traffic", "airports", "embedded systems", "fault diagnosis", "flowcharting", "probability", "IFD analysis", "airport surface traffic movement", "automated reconciliation", "collision risk probability reduction", "conflict detection", "cyber-physical system", "fault conditions", "information flow diagrams", "resolution architecture", "Aerospace safety", "Aircraft navigation", "Safety", "Traffic control", ""], "arnumber": "6693666"}
