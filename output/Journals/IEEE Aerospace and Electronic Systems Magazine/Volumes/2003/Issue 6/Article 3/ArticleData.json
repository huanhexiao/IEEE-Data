A distributed approach offers many potential benefits, such as reduced development time and cost, simplified system installation, increased flexibility for system expansion or modifications, and greater reuse of proven components. The distributed approach can also reduce the risk associated with design errors by splitting complex hardware and software into more manageable components. However, distributed systems also introduce new challenges in meeting real-time deadlines and providing fault tolerance. This paper examines the many design considerations and identifies the strengths and weaknesses of each. Emerging automotive drive-by-wire alternatives are compared for application to aerospace systems. This paper is based on a Draper Laboratory-sponsored effort to look at flight-critical distributed systems and to evaluate emerging hardware and software for building them.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "30", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "36", "date_publication": "June 2003", "inspec": "7666895", "date": "June 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jul 09 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "6", "pages": "30 - 36", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
