During the last years, special efforts have been applied to achieve a great level of security. These efforts have increased security in some aspects, such as cryptographic algorithms and authentication techniques, etc. But many other security holes have appeared in these applications, making the improvements achieved a \"waste of time and money\". In this paper, some of these security holes are exposed. Using security hardware modules can overcome some of these holes, if they are designed according to the applications specification.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "June 2003", "inspec": "7666893", "date": "June 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jul 09 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "6", "pages": "21 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
