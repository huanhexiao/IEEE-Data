Because there is a global debate over selecting the next generation VHF data link (VDL) technology, this paper evaluates each of them for the terminal and enroute airspace only. First, this study provides a historical review of the purpose of data link applications; second, how the current system is failing to meet today's requirements, leading to problems within the US National Air Space (NAS); third, a technical and economic analysis of VDL technologies; and last, a recommendation for selecting a VDL technology.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "20", "date_publication": "June 2003", "inspec": "7666892", "date": "June 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jul 09 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "6", "pages": "15 - 20", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
