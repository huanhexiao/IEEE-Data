Data from three landmine detection sensors mounted at the front of the vehicle enhance the probability of detection and, when combined via data fusion, limit the false alarm density to practical levels. The performance of the voting fusion scheme presented in this paper is contrasted with a heuristic data fusion approach developed by General Dynamics Canada.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "19", "date_publication": "Aug. 2003", "inspec": "7751324", "date": "Aug. 2003", "date_current_version": "Thu Sep 04 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "8", "pages": "13 - 19", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
