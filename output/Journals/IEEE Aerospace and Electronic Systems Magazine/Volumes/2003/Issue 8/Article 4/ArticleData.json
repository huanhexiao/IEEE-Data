It proposes an approach - trusted objects - in which the application program and data are cryptographically encapsulated in their own environment. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: after the authors present a description of trusted objects, their creation, and their execution, their potential applications are described. Finally, issues and problems requiring further research are discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "Aug. 2003", "inspec": "7751323", "date": "Aug. 2003", "date_current_version": "Thu Sep 04 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "8", "pages": "9 - 12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["T.
