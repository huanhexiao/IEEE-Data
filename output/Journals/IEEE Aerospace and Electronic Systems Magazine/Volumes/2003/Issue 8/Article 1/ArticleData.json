In particular, the MUSIC project has successfully demonstrated advanced digital signal processing techniques to mitigate CDMA interference in spread-spectrum receivers, thus increasing the capacity and/or quality of service of a wireless communication network. The low-complexity solution for interference mitigation investigated and developed in the project is particularly suited for being implemented in mobile terminals.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "Aug. 2003", "inspec": "7751326", "date": "Aug. 2003", "date_current_version": "Thu Sep 04 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "8", "pages": "23 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
