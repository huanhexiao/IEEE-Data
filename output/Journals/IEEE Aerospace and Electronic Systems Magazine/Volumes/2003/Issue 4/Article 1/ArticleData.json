For these missions, only altitude and heading hold features are needed. Further, because the vehicle will not be returning, minimizing cost is a priority. Due to the desire to reduce the physical size of the vehicle, the flight control system needs to be of minimal complexity to facilitate miniaturization. Presented is a prototype altitude/heading hold flight control system that has been developed for use in small, stable UAV platforms. Topics covered in this paper include system architecture, hardware, user interface, and preliminary test-flight results. A brief description of the miniature target aircraft, the Naval Research Laboratory's Micro Tactical Expendable (MITE), will be presented as a representation of the class of vehicle under consideration.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "April 2003", "inspec": "7593808", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 22 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "4", "pages": "14 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
