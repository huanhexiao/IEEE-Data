We need-therefore, to decide what the new operational concept should be and agree on the transition path. Air traffic management is the term we apply today to the totality of the activities involved in the handling of air traffic. The quest for a new concept led to what was first called \"free flight,\" an idea that has, in the meantime, acquired some notoriety and is today more commonly referred to in Europe as \"air/ground cooperative ATS.\" Simply put, the original free flight concept, stipulated that given the right on-board equipment (display of traffic information, conflict detection, and resolution tools) aircraft could navigate and avoid each other completely on their own, without the need for ATC. That a new ATM operational concept will be needed to take the industry further by the time traditional methods run out of potential is difficult to question. Equally clear is that the only new concept available is free flight a.k.a. air/ground cooperative ATS.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "10", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "Jan 2003", "inspec": "7518877", "date": "Jan 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 22 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "1", "pages": "10 - 12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["S.
