Many know MIT by name and recall the famous Radiation Laboratory Series. But the more recent technical history has been less in the \"public domain.\" In an attempt to correct this, one of the key institutions in the field, the MIT Lincoln Laboratory two years ago produced a special issue of their regular publication. Although the document currently at hand is not a book in the strict sense, the size, shape, and editorial comprehensiveness of the MIT Lincoln Laboratory Journal's Fifty-Year Anniversary Issue (12, 2, 2000) justifies calling this article being treated as a book review.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "37", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "38", "date_publication": "Jan. 2003", "inspec": "7518882", "date": "Jan. 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 22 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "1", "pages": "37 - 38", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["W.
