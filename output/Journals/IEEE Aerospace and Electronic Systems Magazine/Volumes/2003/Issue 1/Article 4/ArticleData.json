These same attributes are emerging as a strong platform in power source development for the medical and aerospace sectors with highly customized applications and narrowly defined criteria. Accordingly, this new generation of lithium rechargeables must be hermetically sealed, have long-term storage capability, and zero-fault tolerances for common causes of field failures such as electrolyte leakage or short circuits from mechanical deformation. Quallion has been developing and manufacturing highly reliable lithium rechargeable cells for medical, aerospace, and specialty applications. Summarized in this paper are some key technologies developed at Quallion for designing and manufacturing of this new class of lithium rechargeable batteries. They include: 1) leakage reliability; 2) self-extinguishing electrolyte system; 3) mechanical impact resistance; 4) deep discharge storage; and 5) high reliability manufacturing.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "Jan 2003", "inspec": "7518880", "date": "Jan 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 22 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "1", "pages": "21 - 23", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["H.
