This hybrid power source successfully ran pulse power load based on the power profile of the present and future manportable military electronics and communications equipment. The hybrid consisted of a 35 W proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack in parallel with a Li-ion battery. In this work, two cyclic load scenarios were utilized. Each consisted of a baseline load for 9 minutes followed by a higher pulse load for 1 minute. One test profile consisted of 20 W (baseline)/40 W (pulse) load, whereas, the second was 25 W/50 W. Under both scenarios, the hybrid provided significant enhancements in performance over the individual components tested separately. These results are discussed and analyzed. Also discussed are possible future implications of such technology and approach.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Jan 2003", "inspec": "7518878", "date": "Jan 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 22 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "1", "pages": "13 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["L.
