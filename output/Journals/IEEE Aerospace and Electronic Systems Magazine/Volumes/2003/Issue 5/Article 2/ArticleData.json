Unfortunately, the HARM is \"no respecter of persons,\" and it has been known, most notably during the Gulf War, to attack \"friendly\" targets. The international HARM upgrade project is a tri-national missile technology project sponsored by the United States, Italian, and German governments. The HARM precision navigation upgrade (PNU) program has as its goal, the development and installation of a PNU into the HARM that will improve the weapon's effectiveness, while nearly eliminating the likelihood of fratricide. The precision navigation system consists of a modern selective availability anti-spoofing module (SAASM) based Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU), consisting of state-of-the-art fiber optic gyros and a modern micro-machined accelerometer triad.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "26", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "31", "date_publication": "May 2003", "inspec": "7666900", "date": "May 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed May 28 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "5", "pages": "26 - 31", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["T.
