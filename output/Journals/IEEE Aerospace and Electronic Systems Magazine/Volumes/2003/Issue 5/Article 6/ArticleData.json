Emulated peripherals provide the ability to dramatically extend the life of aging ATE equipment, while making that equipment more reliable, more functional, much easier to use, and much simpler to support. The use of emulated disk drives and tape drives can completely eliminate persistent maintenance headaches, increase ATE station availability and reliability, and provide a reasonably priced technology refresh without costly software modifications or system recertification.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "21", "date_publication": "May 2003", "inspec": "7666898", "date": "May 2003", "date_current_version": "Wed May 28 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "5", "pages": "19 - 21", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
