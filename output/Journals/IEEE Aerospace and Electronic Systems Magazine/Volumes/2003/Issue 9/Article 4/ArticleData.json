Two different monitoring technologies - oil debris analysis and vibration were integrated using data fusion into a health monitoring system for detecting surface fatigue pitting damage on gears. This integrated system showed improved detection and decision-making capabilities as compared to using individual monitoring technologies. This diagnostic tool was evaluated by collecting vibration and oil debris data from fatigue tests performed in the NASA Glenn Spiral Bevel Gear Fatigue Rigs. Data was collected during experiments performed in this test rig when pitting damage occurred. Results show that combining the vibration and oil debris measurement technologies improves the detection of pitting damage on spiral bevel gears.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "17", "date_publication": "Sept. 2003", "inspec": "7733311", "date": "Sept. 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Sep 15 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "9", "pages": "11 - 17", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
