These requirements are the result of a decade of study by the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to improve aviation safety and efficiency. In 2001, the USAF mandated compliance to the CNS requirements for its military aircraft, which is called Navigation Safety/Global Air Traffic Management (NS/GATM) by the USAF. By complying with these requirements, the C-17 will maintain its ability to fly internationally without CNS restrictions, such as requiring special handling. The Phase I study reported herein is the first phase of a three-phase study effort that will result in the C-17 achieving NS/GATM compliance for a specific set of NS/CNS requirements.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "37", "date_publication": "Sept. 2003", "inspec": "7733314", "date": "Sept. 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Sep 15 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "9", "pages": "31 - 37", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["B.
