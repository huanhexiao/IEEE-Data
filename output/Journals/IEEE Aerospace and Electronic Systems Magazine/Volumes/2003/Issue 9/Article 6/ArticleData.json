The AC/ATM Project is developing new communications technologies and tools that will enable Free Flight, an operating mode in which pilots will have the freedom to select their path and speed in real-time. The goal of the AC/ATM Project is to enable a communications infrastructure providing the capacity, efficiency, and flexibility necessary to realize benefits arising from the future mature Free Flight environment. A key infrastructure element is the Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN) that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is in the process of fielding.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "27", "date_publication": "Sept. 2003", "inspec": "7733313", "date": "Sept. 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Sep 15 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "9", "pages": "23 - 27", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["T.
