The term is nearly 50 years old with origins in military electronics. With the increasing dependence of aviation on electronics the amount of equipment that falls into this category has skyrocketed. This issue is intended to commemorate the Wright Brothers' Centennial of Powered Flight. It emphasizes aviation-related electrical/electronic advances for the years 1903 to 1953. The following paragraphs highlight some of the major topics discussed in this special issue.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "5", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "July 2003", "inspec": "7705450", "date": "July 2003", "date_current_version": "Thu Sep 04 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "7", "pages": "5 - 12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
