The military began serious investigation of radio navigation during World War I. Up until WW II map reading, dead reckoning, and various means of radio direction finding were the primary methods of determining aircraft position. Since WWII a number of other navigation techniques, such as Doppler radar, radio inertial, pure inertial, aided inertial, and today's integrated GPS inertial, have been developed. Most of the inertial systems evolved from the military ICBM and subsequent space programs.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "36", "date_publication": "July 2003", "inspec": "7705453", "date": "July 2003", "date_current_version": "Thu Sep 04 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "7", "pages": "27 - 36", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
