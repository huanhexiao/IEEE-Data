Substantial advances in avionics have occurred as aviation progressed from biplanes to civil transports to sub/supersonic military craft and finally the Space Shuttle. Aircraft stability can be defined as aircraft control by maintaining a favorable relationship between center of gravity (CG) and the center of pressure (CP).", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "37", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "42", "date_publication": "July 2003", "inspec": "7705454", "date": "July 2003", "date_current_version": "Thu Sep 04 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "7", "pages": "37 - 42", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
