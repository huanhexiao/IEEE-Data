[A century of powered flight: 1903-2003]", "abstract": "Unmanned air vehicles (UAV) are assuming a prominent role in aviation and the future may have already arrived. Most of us have heard of the Global Hawk and Predator UAVs, which have been collecting real-time battlefield data without risking loss of life. However, the most amazing performance and avionics can be found in airplane-model-size MiniUAVs and insect-like MicroUAVs still on the drawing board. Meanwhile the all-electric NASA Helios \"tower in the sky\" is moving ever closer to reality.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "61", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "63", "date_publication": "July 2003", "inspec": "7705458", "date": "July 2003", "date_current_version": "Thu Sep 04 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "7", "pages": "61 - 63", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
