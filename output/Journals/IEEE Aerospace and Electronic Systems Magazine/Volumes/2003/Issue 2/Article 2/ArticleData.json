The evolution of military avionics data buses is discussed. The development trend actually reflects an increasing demand on such data buses, which requires the change from low-speed to high-speed transmissions, from single-rate to dual-rate operations, and from centralized control to distributed control. Recent progress in military avionics networks is described.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "Feb. 2003", "inspec": "7557026", "date": "Feb. 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Mar 10 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "2", "pages": "18 - 22", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J. -G.
