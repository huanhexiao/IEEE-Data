We are developing a design language for network-centric systems and design guidelines for the development system of engineers and domain specialists involved in designing and integrating systems. Note: this development system with today's technology is also a network-centric system. An outline of the design language under construction and the design guidelines being studied is provided. Specifically we discuss ATMS mission objectives (e.g., average yearly throughput of people and freight for a high demand scenario); ATMS sample usage scenarios (e.g., ATMS reroutes air traffic in time and space in reaction to major weather deviation along the northeast coast); and system objectives for an ATMS (e.g., timelines of a specific high volume of messages from aircraft, weather sensors, and airports). We lay out some key design decisions associated with both the development system of engineers and domain specialists and the operational ATMS. Examples of key design decisions for the engineering system are: 1) appropriate partitioning of functional/physical architectures of the engineering system; 2) appropriate degree to telecollaboration and collaboration among design/integration groups; 3) appropriate incremental delivery packages for an incremental delivery schedule of ATMS elements; and 4) appropriate levels and thrusts of the risk management program. Examples of key design decisions for the operational ATMS are: 1) throughput and security trades of the ATMS and 2) throughput and resiliency to weather changes. Finally, we relate network-centric architecture issues to both of the above sets of design decisions.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "inspec": "7834638", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 10 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "10", "pages": "3 - 8", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
