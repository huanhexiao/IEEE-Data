A means to provide surveillance data to airborne users through ground-based Traffic Information Service-Broadcast (TIS-B) can speed the transition and reward early equipage. This paper describes the concepts and functionality being developed by RTCA Special Committee 186 Working Group 2, as well as foreseen improvements and current testing activities. Active coordination is continuing with international standards developments.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "inspec": "7834639", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 10 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "10", "pages": "13 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
