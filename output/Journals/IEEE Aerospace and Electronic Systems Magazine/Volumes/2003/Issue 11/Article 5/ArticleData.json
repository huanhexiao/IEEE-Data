The rather conventional \"six-out-of-eight\" pulse radar selection method with binary output has been compared to an algorithm that accepts a target if the pre-defined trigger level is crossed by the average of the eight consecutive pulses. In this case, however, the output is an analog value corresponding to the relative average video amplitude. In terms of plotted video, this process seems to give a slightly better combination of false alarm rate and detection probability. Large targets are easier to detect from foliage clutter with the conventional method.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "26", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "Nov. 2003", "inspec": "7782546", "date": "Nov. 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 24 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "11", "pages": "26 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
