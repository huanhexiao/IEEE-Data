This paper introduces the special advantages of the combination of ultra-wideband technology and random signal radar to the international radar community. It shows that these two radar systems have a very close relationship in nature and can gain significant benefits from each other. It can be anticipated that the random signal modulated waveform will open many potential possibilities for the applications of ultra-wideband radar systems to civilian operating environments.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "7", "date_publication": "Nov. 2003", "inspec": "7782541", "date": "Nov. 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 24 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "11", "pages": "3 - 7", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Hongbo Sun", "Yilong Lu", "Guosui Liu"], "keywords": ["radar", "UWB", "civilian operating environments", "combined radar systems", "fractional bandwidth", "random signal modulation", "random signal radar", "ultra-wideband radar", "ultra-wideband technology", "Bandwidth", "Frequency", "Low-frequency noise", "Pulse amplifiers", "Semiconductor device noise", "Semiconductor laser arrays", "Spread spectrum radar", "Sun", "Ultra wideband radar", "Ultra wideband technology", ""], "arnumber": "1246580"}
