We have developed an innovative sustained data recording system based on disk array which consists of Array Controller Module (ACM), String Controller Module (SCM) and Main Controller Module (MCM). This system has a better performance and higher reliability than the traditional tape recorder and can be used conveniently in many areas of data recording, storing, playback, and remote backup. This novel recording system has been used in radar data recorder for spacecraft orbit tracking and satellite remote sensing data recording successfully.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "34", "date_publication": "Nov. 2003", "inspec": "7782547", "date": "Nov. 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 24 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "11", "pages": "31 - 34", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Changlong Jiang", "Jianping Xiong", "Xugang Zhang", "Huibo Jia", "Duanyi Xu"], "keywords": ["RAID", "data recording", "magnetic disc storage", "Array Controller Module", "Main Controller Module", "String Controller Module", "disk array", "playback", "reliability", "remote backup", "satellite remote sensing data", "spacecraft orbit tracking data", "sustained data recording system", "Control systems", "Disk recording", "Field programmable gate arrays", "Payloads", "Radar tracking", "Remote sensing", "Satellite ground stations", "Space vehicles", "Spaceborne radar", "Telemetry", ""], "arnumber": "1246586"}
