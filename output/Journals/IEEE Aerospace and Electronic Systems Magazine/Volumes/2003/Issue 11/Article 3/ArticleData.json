This requires using modern non-destructive evaluation (NDE) procedures and equipment which yields information that supports the operator's wire health management program and feeds into his aging aircraft or shuttle containment processes. Commonly used wire inspection processes do not compliment aircraft electrical systems making it difficult to diagnose wiring problems or manage wiring systems health. The wire inspection tools in common use today can be represented by the volt/ohm meter, the meg/ohm meter, and visual techniques. The two meters only measure conductivity, connectivity, and insulation breakdown strength. Visual techniques, mirror and flashlight methods only reach about 25% of the aircraft wiring and subjectively identify only physical faults of the insulation and simple damaged components. Little can be determined relative to the wire, insulation, bundle, connector, connector pins, backshell, wire supports, grounding, shielding, or intended electrical systems performance. All items where data is necessary to analyze and manage the health of the system. Guidance material is currently not available for the electrical repairman for even a simplified zonal inspection. The user community also reports gross shortcomings in the guidance supplied by the manufacture's maintenance and repair manuals.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Nov. 2003", "inspec": "7782543", "date": "Nov. 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 24 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "11", "pages": "11 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
