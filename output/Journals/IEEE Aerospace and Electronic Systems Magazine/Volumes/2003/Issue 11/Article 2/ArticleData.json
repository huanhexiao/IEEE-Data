The theory and practice of current radar systems are based of this specific feature. But as is known, it is the frequency band that determines the information content of radar systems, as the volume of information transmitted per time unit is directly proportional to the frequency band. To raise the information capability of a radar system, the widening of its frequency band is needed. The only alternative approach is an increase in information transmission time. The actuality of this problem has determined rapid development in the last years of technologies using ultra wide band (UWB) signals. This paper describes the principles and features of UWB radar.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "8", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "Nov. 2003", "inspec": "7782542", "date": "Nov. 2003", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 24 00:00:00 EST 2003", "issue": "11", "pages": "8 - 10", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["I.
