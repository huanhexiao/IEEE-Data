During recent years, the scientific community has been trying to improve biometric techniques to be accepted as an alternative to other user authentication schemes. One of the sectors where user identity must be verified, is the identification cards sector. In fact, if great security wants to be achieved, smart cards should be used. But cardholder verification is performed using Card Holder Verification Keys (CHV-Keys), which are PIN-based. The authors are trying to integrate fingerprint verification inside a smart card, following their works in the past. The fingerprint scheme used is shown, and the work to achieve the integration inside a commercial smart card is detailed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "22", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "Mar 2003", "inspec": "7593805", "date": "Mar 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 15 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "3", "pages": "22 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
