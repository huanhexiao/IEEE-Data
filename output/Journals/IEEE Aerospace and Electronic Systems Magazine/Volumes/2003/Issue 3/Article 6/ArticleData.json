Secure Flow is a totally integrated transportation security system. It is a strategic program with multiple integration projects each being a vector such as: checked baggage, checkpoint, cargo/mail, airport, aircraft, port terminal, and cruise ships. Secure Flow identifies requirements for the establishment of protocols, standards, communications, and development of technologies to link deployable security equipment into a totally integrated transportation security system. The objective of Secure Flow is to secure the flow of passengers, baggage, and cargo from origin to destination to meet the operationally viable needs of the future seamless US Transportation System for the traveling public.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "15", "date_publication": "Mar 2003", "inspec": "7593803", "date": "Mar 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 15 00:00:00 EDT 2003", "issue": "3", "pages": "13 - 15", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
