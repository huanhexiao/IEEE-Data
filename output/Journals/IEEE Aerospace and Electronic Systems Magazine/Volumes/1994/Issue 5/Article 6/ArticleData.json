A number of schemes are under consideration (heat engine battery, fuel cell battery, peaking battery, inner-city battery, etc.). The success of any of the approaches will be dependent on battery capabilities, i.e., power, density, life, and cost. The nickel-metal hydride system appears to be the most promising of the candidate battery chemistries. Preliminary designs and analysis have been prepared and are presented for various configurations. Initial performance characterization tests are presented. It is concluded that a bipolar package arrangement for the Ni-MH chemistry appears most suited for the hybrid vehicle application considered", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "24", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "May 1994", "inspec": "4728448", "date": "May 1994", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "24 - 28", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
