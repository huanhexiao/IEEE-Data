A large distribution of such data to scientists not directly involved in a space mission project is a relevant objective worthy of interest. This evolution requires an increase in returned data volumes and higher data rates, envisaging the need for complex Interplanetary communications architectures and technologies.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "4", "date_publication": "Feb. 2011", "date": "Feb. 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 24 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "2", "pages": "4", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Mauro De Sanctis"], "keywords": ["Communication systems", "Planets", "Space exploration", "Space missions", ""], "arnumber": "5739482"}
