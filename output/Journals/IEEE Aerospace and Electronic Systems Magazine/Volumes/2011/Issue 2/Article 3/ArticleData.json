The aim is to show that interplanetary communication is performed through particular networks, which, on one hand, use most of the pervasive communication paradigm but, on the other hand, own features that allow the extension of the pervasive network concept. This contains an introduction of pervasive networking and of interplanetary communication and presents the future challenges of both focusing on architectures and protocols, and taking the new solutions of delay tolerant networking (DTN) as a reference point. The use of new interworking devices, called Extended Gateways, aimed at getting efficient interworking over interplanetary networks by joining the features of QoS and DTN Gateways, is envisaged.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "12", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "Feb. 2011", "inspec": "11883392", "date": "Feb. 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 24 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "2", "pages": "12 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Mario Marchese"], "keywords": ["internetworking", "protocols", "space communication links", "ubiquitous computing", "Extended Gateways", "QoS", "architectures", "delay tolerant networking", "interplanetary communication", "pervasive communication", "protocols", "Communication systems", "Pervasive computing", "Space exploration", "Space missions", "Telecommunication network management", ""], "arnumber": "5739484"}
