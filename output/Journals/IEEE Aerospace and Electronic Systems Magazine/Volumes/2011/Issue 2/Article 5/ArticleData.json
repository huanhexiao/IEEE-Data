Autonomic operation minimizes failure risk by performing local configurations using collected context data and on-board policies, improving response time to events, and reducing remote mission management expense. Herein, we evaluate cost-benefit impacts when a context-aware brokering algorithm developed to achieve autonomy is applied to interplanetary communications systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "26", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "33", "date_publication": "Feb. 2011", "inspec": "11883394", "date": "Feb. 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 24 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "2", "pages": "26 - 33", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
