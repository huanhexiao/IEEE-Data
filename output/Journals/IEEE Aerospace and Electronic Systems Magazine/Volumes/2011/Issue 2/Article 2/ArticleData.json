Herein, we Introduce packets Interleaving CCSDS me delivery protocol (PI-CFDP) developed to cope with frequent packet losses Inherent In deep-space communications. It is designed by applying fountain codes to CFDP for Interleaving packets prior to transmission. Simulation shows that the PI-CFDP protocol is able to shorten the me delivery time and enhance the validity of communication.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "5", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "11", "date_publication": "Feb. 2011", "inspec": "11883391", "date": "Feb. 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 24 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "2", "pages": "5 - 11", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Jian Jiao", "Qing Guol", "Qinyu Zhang"], "keywords": ["codes", "protocols", "space communication links", "Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems", "deep space communication", "fountain codes", "packets interleaving CCSDS file delivery protocol", "traditional retransmission mechanisms", "Communication systems", "Data processing", "Interleaved codes", "Loss measurement", "Space exploration", "Space missions", ""], "arnumber": "5739483"}
