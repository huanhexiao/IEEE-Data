In the first phase, a three-dimensional (3-D) target model is generated and the model features are predicted based on the sensor's perspective relative to the 3-D target model. The second phase of the process, multi-scale structuring elements are generated pertaining to the 3-D target model and flight trajectory. Structuring elements for infrared image is selected by a look-up-table approach based on the parameters of sensor's view, and the use of morphology-based filters can respond to the size and shape of target to suppress the clutter background. In the following process, iterative segmentation for the result image of background suppression is used to obtain regions of interest (ROIs), and features extraction of ROIs and matching retain the ROIs that are closest to predicted features. Lastly, the target is identified by fusing the line features and multi-frame integration. Experiment results show the proposed algorithm can precisely recognize the target from FLIR images with a complicated background.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "28", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "33", "date_publication": "May 2011", "inspec": "12047300", "date": "May 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Jun 09 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "5", "pages": "28 - 33", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Xiaoyu Yang", "Tianxu Zhang", "Ying Lu"], "keywords": ["civil engineering", "feature extraction", "image recognition", "infrared imaging", "table lookup", "3D target model", "FLIR image", "background suppression", "building recognition", "clutter background", "feature extraction", "flight trajectory", "forward looking infrared image", "look-up-table approach", "morphology-based filter", "multiframe integration", "region of interest", "three-dimensional target model", "Clutter", "Image recognition", "Image segmentation", "Infrared imaging", "Iterative methods", "Three dimensional displays", "Variable speed drives", ""], "arnumber": "5871388"}
