In special signal propagation environments, such as indoors, urban crayons, and woods, various factors such as signal propagation power loss, amplitude attenuation, and phase, time, and frequency delay distortions produce at the signal receiving end, what is now known in the literature as, the GPS signal near-far effect, which results in severe degradation of the GPS signal acquisition performance. To mitigate the near-far effect, we focus on four main factors, which are the signal strength attenuation; the Doppler frequency distortion; carrier phase uncertainty; and multi-path distribution because a proper optimization of these factors appears to improve the acquisition performance effectively.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "27", "date_publication": "May 2011", "inspec": "12047299", "date": "May 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Jun 09 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "5", "pages": "18 - 27", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Pengda Huang", "Yiming Pi"], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "Doppler frequency distortion", "GPS receivers", "GPS signal acquisition", "GPS signal near-far effect", "amplitude attenuation", "carrier phase uncertainty", "frequency delay distortions", "multi-path distribution", "satellite navigation signal processing", "signal propagation environments", "signal propagation power loss", "urban environment solutions", "Communication standards", "Data communication", "Digital multimedia broadcasting", "Global Positioning System", "Multiplexing", "Urban areas", ""], "arnumber": "5871387"}
