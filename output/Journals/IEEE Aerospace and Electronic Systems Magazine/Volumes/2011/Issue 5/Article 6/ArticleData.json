The research is exploring human computer interfaces to dramatically improve the interface between Army users and their information systems for the Army After Next. Leveraging of university research grants, industrial internal R&D funds, and other governmental agency funding has substantially amplified all consortia members investments.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "38", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "42", "date_publication": "May 2011", "inspec": "12047302", "date": "May 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Jun 09 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "5", "pages": "38 - 42", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Brian T.
