This approach consists of a layered architecture that isolates applications from underlying hardware and software elements such as operating systems, middlewares, communication fabrics, and computer platforms. The framework also consists of a set of component libraries that are being populated as the framework is applied in an expanding series of application domains. Easy swapability for the library components or newly developed components along with a high degree of hardware independence allows systems built using this infrastructure to be easily maintained and upgraded.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "34", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "37", "date_publication": "May 2011", "inspec": "12047301", "date": "May 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Jun 09 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "5", "pages": "34 - 37", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["John A.
