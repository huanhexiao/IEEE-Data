The addition of these additional channels will enable the use of advanced signal processing to improve signal/clutter in an adaptive mode. Elimination of strone point and ground clutter returns from the low-level, volumetrically-distributed weather cell returns is a new application of adaptive processing. The NSF funded 8-channel receiver has been added to the National Weather Radar Testbed (NWRT) system in Norman, Oklahoma, to enable operation as a multi-function and/or adaptive processing system. Herein, we describe the system concept, system installation and early results from fielded weather data returns.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "12", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "15", "date_publication": "Oct. 2011", "inspec": "12341953", "date": "Oct. 2011", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 07 00:00:00 EST 2011", "issue": "10", "pages": "12 - 15", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
