In terms of aviation, it's time to start thinking about how to move people and goods, in commercial quantities, with a zero-carbon footprint; indeed there are several schemes afoot. The pioneering Boeing and Lange/DLR fuel-cell prototype airplanes are an encouraging sign up to a point, but it seems more than bold to suggest that these models can be scaled up to commercial adequacy. The USAF/DARPA high-altitude Intel blimp provides ample carrying capacity and a ceiling of 65,000 feet, but again, not much of a useful turn of speed. Popular Science has reported on multiple-gas vehicles like the Sanswire STS-111 Stratellite and airship concepts such as Igor Pasternak's Aeroscraft. Of these, only the last seems to be well-targeted toward the goal, according to some accounts. This undertakes to apply some of the perennial concerns participants to a global fleet of dirigibles featuring fuel-cell-powered propulsion. That is, it adopts a global-system view taking the development of suitable vehicles for granted, rather than focusing on the vehicle innovations as their developers must primarily do. Discussions include performance and safety requirements for the airships, new terminal area concepts, collaborative-autonomous situational awareness and collision avoidance, weather considerations, in-flight refueling and towing, and intermodal possibilities.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "11", "date_publication": "Oct. 2011", "inspec": "12341952", "date": "Oct. 2011", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 07 00:00:00 EST 2011", "issue": "10", "pages": "4 - 11", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Hugh Blair-Smith"], "keywords": ["aerospace propulsion", "airships", "fuel cell vehicles", "Lange-DLR fuel-cell prototype airplanes", "Tom swift", "USAF-DARPA high-altitude Intel blimp", "collision avoidance", "commercial quantities", "electric airship", "fossil carbon", "fuel-cell-powered propulsion", "igor pasternak aeroscraft", "in-flight refueling", "intermodal possibilities", "multiple-gas vehicles", "sanswire STS-111 stratellite", "zero-carbon footprint", "Aerospace electronics", "Aircraft manufacture", "Electric vehicles", "Energy consumption", "Fuel cells", "Green design", ""], "arnumber": "6065652"}
