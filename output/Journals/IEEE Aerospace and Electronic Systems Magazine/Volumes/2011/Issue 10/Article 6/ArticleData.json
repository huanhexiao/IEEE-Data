The Turkish Air Force Academy personnel together with a team of cadets have been working on the design and development of an autonomous Quadrotor vehicle for educational purposes. The main emphasis was to study the flight dynamics of such a vehicle but the development of on-board electronics that consists of a sensor payload, embedded computer, and other hardware, along with the embedded software was such a critical work package under the project that required special emphasis and an innovative approach. A new avionic architecture that is derived from the rationale of Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) architecture of today's larger platforms is proposed and currently being implemented within the framework of our project. The advantages of this approach for the development of mini/micro UAVs along with the academic education of our cadets will be discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "35", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "40", "date_publication": "Oct. 2011", "inspec": "12341956", "date": "Oct. 2011", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 07 00:00:00 EST 2011", "issue": "10", "pages": "35 - 40", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Mustafa Ilarslan", "M.
