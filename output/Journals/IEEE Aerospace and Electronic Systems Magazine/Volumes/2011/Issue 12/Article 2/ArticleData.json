The first is that while a bottom-up approach to the development of a health monitor system may yield a health monitor hardware or software that is used to instantiate a system. They will become more system that produces some useful assurances to the system, it is not possible to prove that such a solution is a closed-form, tractable solution for any reasonably complex system. Health monitor systems that have been developed in the past using this technique have, therefore, been difficult to extend or embed in existing systems and it has been difficult to determine when the health monitor is completed. However, they have proven to be quite effective in the limited scope that they address within the operation of the system. This is important, because it demonstrates health monitoring technology in use.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "10", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Dec. 2011", "inspec": "12489581", "date": "Dec. 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 26 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "12", "pages": "10 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Mbuyi Khuzadi"], "keywords": ["aerospace computing", "aerospace safety", "condition monitoring", "design engineering", "production engineering computing", "health monitor design", "health monitor hardware", "health monitor software", "health monitoring system", "Airplanes", "Closed-form solutions", "Humans", "Interference", "Monitoring", ""], "arnumber": "6138396"}
