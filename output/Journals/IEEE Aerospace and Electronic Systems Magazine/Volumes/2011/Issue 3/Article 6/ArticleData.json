The main objective of this presentation is to acquaint our audience with the structure features, design, and algorithms of the system, allowing us to raise the accuracy and integrity of the navigation data and to show the results of its natural tests: at the test-bench and on a vehicle. The structure and design of the system were defined taking into account that it should be installed aboard the unmanned aerial vehicle, \u201cDozor\u201d (Joint-Stock Company \u201cTransas\u201d).", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "39", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "41", "date_publication": "March 2011", "inspec": "11911268", "date": "March 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Apr 07 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "3", "pages": "39 - 41", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["K.
