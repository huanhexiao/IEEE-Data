There are increasing opportunities to use visual images coupled with image processing technologies for spacecraft sensing and control. To fill this need, we have developed a small, low-cost, high-performance image acquisition and processing unit (HP-IMAP), which uses commercial off-the-shelf technologies. In 2010, the HP-IMAP was launched to monitor a deployable structure. Herein, we describe the HP-IMAP and discuss its qualification tests.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "March 2011", "inspec": "11911265", "date": "March 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Apr 07 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "3", "pages": "19 - 25", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Shinichi Kimura", "Akira Miyasaka", "Ryu Funase", "Hirotaka Sawada", "Nobuomi Sakamoto", "Naoki Miyashita"], "keywords": ["data acquisition", "image processing", "COTS technologies", "high-performance image acquisition", "image processing unit", "space activities", "spacecraft sensing", "visual capabilities", "visual images", "Cameras", "Electron tubes", "Image processing", "Integrated optics", "Optical imaging", "Optical sensors", "Software", "Visualization", ""], "arnumber": "5746181"}
