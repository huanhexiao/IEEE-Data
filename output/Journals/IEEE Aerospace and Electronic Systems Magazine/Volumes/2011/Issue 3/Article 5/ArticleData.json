It is shown that other methods of ultra-tightly coupled GPS/INS integrated navigation systems are included in the proposed framework, and some implementation issues are discussed. In order to show the validity of the proposed approach, position accuracy and anti-jamming capabilities of three methods of ultra-tightly-coupled GPS/INS integration system, included in the proposed framework, were compared. The comparisons were carried out through computer simulations and post-processing of data from a GNSS hardware simulator. The results show that the proposed approach works well and gives accurate navigation output with anti-jamming capability.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "30", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "38", "date_publication": "March 2011", "inspec": "11911267", "date": "March 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Apr 07 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "3", "pages": "30 - 38", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
