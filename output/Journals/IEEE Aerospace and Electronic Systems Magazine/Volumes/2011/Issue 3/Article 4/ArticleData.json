The simulation model allows us to determine the level of influence of different distortions of the observed image on the UAV's landing accuracy. The correlation extremal system of terminal guidance (CESTG) of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) executed on the basis of an optoelectronic sensor has found its application as a tool providing the terminal delivery of UAV's freight to the planned Earth surface area or automatic landing of an unmanned helicopter (UH) on a selected place or on a surface ship deck. In operation, the CESTG carries out a search for a landing place (freight delivery), guidance to the selected landing place (freight delivery) at the UAV's approach and the exact path of the UAV to the selected area in the processing of current information receiving at the discrete moments of time (shot shaping time) about the surveillance area from the optoelectronic sensor.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "26", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "March 2011", "inspec": "11911266", "date": "March 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Apr 07 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "3", "pages": "26 - 29", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["G.
