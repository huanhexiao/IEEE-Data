The devices mentioned reflect the main stages of the attitude control system development throughout history at the Control Device Department of Tula State University, ranging from classical platform systems to micromechanical and pyrometer strap-down attitude reference systems. A multi-functional attitude gyroscope based on two two-degrees-of-freedom gyros driven by electric gyro motors has been discussed as a classical platform attitude gyroscope. Strap-down vertical references are represented by system samples based on micromechanical inertial sensors and pyrometer detectors. This provides the specifications of vertical references concerned and performs the comparative analysis thereof. It also shows the advantages and disadvantages of each of these systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "42", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "44", "date_publication": "March 2011", "inspec": "11911269", "date": "March 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Apr 07 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "3", "pages": "42 - 44", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["V.
