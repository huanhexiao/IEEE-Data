The aspects of space systems which lend themselves to a concept of Global Virtual Presence also create requirements and technological challenges for protecting the space assets and assuring their operation in the presence of the natural and man-made space environments which can potentially degrade system performance or cause lifetime-limiting damage. This will discuss the \u201cprotection environment,\u201d the process and methods used for determining protection needs, and the framework employed to identify potential protection solutions. The emphasis will be on the orbital segments of space systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "37", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "41", "date_publication": "July 2011", "inspec": "12121434", "date": "July 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Jul 21 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "7", "pages": "37 - 41", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Charles A.
