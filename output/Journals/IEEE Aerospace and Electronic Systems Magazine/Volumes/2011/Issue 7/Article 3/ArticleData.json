An array of elements of the legislative process has been put in place to make this effort possible. Although this Regulatory Framework opens the way for liberalization, the strategic nature of the sector and the necessity of guaranteeing continuity of service and safety, means there are some prior conditions related to legal and operational aspects, as reflected in European regulations. These conditions will act as a significant barrier to entry for new providers.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "July 2011", "date": "July 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Jul 21 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "7", "pages": "23 - 29", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Fernando G\u00f3mez Comendador", "Rosa Arnaldo Vald\u00e9s", "L.
