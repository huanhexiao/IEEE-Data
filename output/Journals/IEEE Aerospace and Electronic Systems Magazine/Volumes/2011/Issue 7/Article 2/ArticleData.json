This model requires near-constant telemetry regarding the status of the vehicle, as well as tasks on-board. The future long-duration exploration missions being considered will require significant changes in this operational paradigm, adjusting to situational realities, capitalizing on the evolution that has occurred in vehicle autonomous health management, and maximizing the time crew members can devote to exploration.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "July 2011", "date": "July 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Jul 21 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "7", "pages": "18 - 22", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Matthew J.
