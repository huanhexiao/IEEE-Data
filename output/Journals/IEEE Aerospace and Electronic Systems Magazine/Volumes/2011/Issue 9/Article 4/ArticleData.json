This is characterized in the proliferation through Base Realignment and Closure acquisition and in-house development of a wide variety of general and special-purpose ATS - to date, there are 94 unique ATS and a total of 230 ATS. With advancing technology and increasingly complex electronic systems, unique ATS has become a problem of maintenance test strategies at the depot; given the high costs of modernizing or replacing ATS and its potential effect on meeting mission success requirements. The aging testers at TYAD are becoming increasingly out-of-date and more difficult to support. When the testers do not work properly, maintenance can suffer and mission readiness can be adversely affected. This will analyze the problem and present a plan for modernization of ATS at TYAD that satisfies Army Regulation, AR750-43, and DoD ATS acquisition policy.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "22", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "Sept. 2011", "inspec": "12341958", "date": "Sept. 2011", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 07 00:00:00 EST 2011", "issue": "9", "pages": "22 - 26", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["David R.
