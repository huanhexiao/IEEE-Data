These tools provide inconsistent metrics that make problem resolution inefficient and reactive rather than proactive and effective. A systems engineering approach is proposed that considers enterprise monitoring and analysis in high-speed enterprise communications systems done by support centers via collaboration rather than in isolation. This presents graphical representations of various aspects of the monitoring and analysis approach that include architectural, operational, systems-level, and technical views. For each of these views we identify the applicable system components and the integration of these components that enable solution of system-wide problems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "33", "date_publication": "Sept. 2011", "inspec": "12331965", "date": "Sept. 2011", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 07 00:00:00 EST 2011", "issue": "9", "pages": "27 - 33", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Paul Hershey", "Charles B.
