The main evolution of these systems, from a design point of view, have two origins, one the Tactical Picture Compilation (TPC), the other the extension of the warfare domain of weapon systems connected to MFR. As far as TPC is concerned, Long Range coverage and proximity of littoral, have been the major requirements impacting the design of naval MFR. This discusses the principal features of typical architecture for modern Naval Multi-Function radar, and how the requested new missions impact the design.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "34", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "39", "date_publication": "Sept. 2011", "inspec": "12341959", "date": "Sept. 2011", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 07 00:00:00 EST 2011", "issue": "9", "pages": "34 - 39", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Stephane C\u00f4te"], "keywords": ["military radar", "naval engineering", "weapons", "MFR", "TPC", "naval multifunction radar", "tactical picture compilation", "warfare domain", "weapon systems", "Military equipment", "Radar applications", "Weapons", ""], "arnumber": "6069903"}
