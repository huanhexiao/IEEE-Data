These invariably include a group of tests that are called electromagnetic interference (EMI) and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) tests. The EMI/EMC qualification test phase is usually performed on an engineering model and for the first flight unit. An EMI/EMC qualification test phase is comprised of four major tests: \u00b7 Conducted Emissions, \u00b7 Conducted Susceptibility, \u00b7 Radiated Emissions, and \u00b7 Radiated Susceptibility. These tests, several other EMI/EMC-like tests, important applicable documents, exceptions to the guidelines in these applicable documents; testing problems and solutions are described. This is intended as an introduction for the designer/builder of an electronic unit so they may be able to plan for, and intelligently participate in a very important phase of their design's qualification. This will ensure that the entire system functions properly in its intended electromagnetic environment.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "24", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "June 2011", "inspec": "12093140", "date": "June 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Jun 30 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "6", "pages": "24 - 29", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Leo A.
