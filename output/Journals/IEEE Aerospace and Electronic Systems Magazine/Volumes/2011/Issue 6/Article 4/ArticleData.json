The tendency of these systems is to use either acoustic (report or projectile fly-by) or optical (muzzle flash or tracer tracking) methods to allow signal processing to determine point of origin. The authors have developed a simple system for characterizing the muzzle flash duration of common military small-arms ammunition as a feeder for system design considerations. This reports on the results of that characterization.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "30", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "37", "date_publication": "June 2011", "inspec": "12093141", "date": "June 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Jun 30 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "6", "pages": "30 - 37", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Tom Burke", "Duane Bratlie"], "keywords": ["fires", "projectiles", "signal processing", "weapons", "acoustic method", "broadband visible", "military small-arm ammunition", "optical method", "signal processing", "small arm fire muzzle flash", "Broadband communication", "Guns", "Ignition", "Projectiles", "Propulsion", "Tracking", "Weapons", ""], "arnumber": "5936183"}
