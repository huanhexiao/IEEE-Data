The simulated signal is under-sampled with lower PRF to match an air traffic control (ATC) radar. The simulated signal is compared to the ATC radar data collected at two different sites. Remarkable similarities of the signal features are identified. These features may help to improve the primary radar detection and tracking performance in the future.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "39", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "42", "date_publication": "Aug. 2011", "inspec": "12213383", "date": "Aug. 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 11 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "8", "pages": "39 - 42", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Yuchoi F.
