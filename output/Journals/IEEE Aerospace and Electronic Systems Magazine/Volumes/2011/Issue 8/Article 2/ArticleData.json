The flexibility and variability of the many array types and configurations combine to accommodate a multitude of mission applications and space environments. Solar array technologies and their system configurations changed dramatically over the years as more aggressive and demanding requirements were imposed. This addresses the historical solar array technology trends. The evolution of solar array technologies and the key requirements responsible for driving this evolution is presented. Industry growth trends toward future systems are identified. Evolutionary technological improvements in photovoltaics, structural platforms, and deployment systems are shown. Array selection criteria for a variety of requirements, applications, and environments are presented. Solar array technologies required to meet future mission trends are shown.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "Aug. 2011", "inspec": "12213382", "date": "Aug. 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 11 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "8", "pages": "17 - 28", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
