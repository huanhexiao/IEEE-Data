Some of the near-space vehicle advantages include their potential for some specific radar applications that require persistentiy monitoring or fast-revisiting frequency which are explained herein. The role of near-space vehicles is reviewed in supplying a gap between satellites and airplanes for microwave remote sensing applications. Several potential applications such as passive surveillance, reconnaissance, and high resolution wide swath imaging are described. The novel multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO)-based multi-aperture in elevation and space-time coding (STC) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) are presented for high resolution wide swath imaging. Therefore, given their operational flexibility, near-space vehicle-borne radars may supply the gap between space-borne and airborne radars which is the reason we appeal to the systems engineering community for more publications and more support on the research and development of near-space vehicle-borne radars.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "9", "date_publication": "April 2011", "inspec": "11973602", "date": "April 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu May 05 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "4", "pages": "4 - 9", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Wen-Qin Wang"], "keywords": ["MIMO communication", "aircraft", "artificial satellites", "celestial mechanics", "remote sensing by radar", "space vehicles", "spaceborne radar", "synthetic aperture radar", "LEO satellite", "MIMO", "SAR", "STC", "airplane", "distance 20 km to 100 km", "elevation multiaperture", "fast-revisiting frequency", "fuel consumption", "high resolution wide swath imaging", "low earth orbit satellite", "multiple-input and multiple-output", "near-space vehicle-borne radar", "orbital mechanics", "passive surveillance", "remote sensing", "space-time coding synthetic aperture radar", "Image resolution", "Microwave imaging", "Monitoring", "Radar imaging", "Radar measurements", "Radar tracking", "Remote sensing", "Satellites", "Space vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "5763337"}
