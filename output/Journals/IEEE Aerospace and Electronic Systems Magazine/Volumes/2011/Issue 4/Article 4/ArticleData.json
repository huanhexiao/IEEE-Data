The system operators work on basic interoperability agreements which simplify multi-system navigation receiver architecture and reduce its cost. The most current GNSS signals of GPS, GLONASS and Galileo can be processed by one or several classical E-L correlators with a look up table PRN generator of a length of 10,230 chips. Most signals are processed optimally, but for some signals, like Galileo E1b and E1c or GPS L1C, this signal processor does not utilize all signal components and properties. The proposed E-L correlator was implemented to the FPGA of the experimental software GNSS receiver and was tested on the Galileo E1b, E1c, and E5a signals. The target multi-system GNSS receiver architecture based on an ExpressCard peripheral card for the standard PC computer or notebook is described herein. Up to one hundred universal correlators and signal snapshot capture unit for DSP acquisition are programmed to the receiver FPGA.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "24", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "April 2011", "inspec": "11973605", "date": "April 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu May 05 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "4", "pages": "24 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
