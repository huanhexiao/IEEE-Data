The simulator uses FlightGear as its simulation environment and an in-house developed UH-1H helicopter flight dynamics model. Running several clone simulations on different computers allowed stereo imaging on the HMD and instructor station applications. Data Gloves with trackers enabled interaction with the virtual cockpit.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "10", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "14", "date_publication": "April 2011", "inspec": "11973603", "date": "April 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu May 05 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "4", "pages": "10 - 14", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Ilkay Yavrucuk", "Eser Kubali", "Onur Tarimci"], "keywords": ["aerospace simulation", "data gloves", "helicopters", "helmet mounted displays", "virtual reality", "FlightGear", "UH-1H helicopter flight dynamics model", "data gloves", "flight simulator", "head-mount-displays", "helicopter simulator", "low-cost flight simulation", "simulation environment", "stereo imaging", "virtual cockpit", "virtual reality tools", "Atmospheric modeling", "Complexity theory", "IP networks", "Receivers", "Tracking", "Universal Serial Bus", "Virtual reality", "Visualization", ""], "arnumber": "5763338"}
