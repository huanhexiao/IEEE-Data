First, it describes the architecture of RS and 1M systems, and analyzes the performance requirements of the RTCM SC-104 document. In order to achieve this study, we proposed the design of the software for the DGNSS RSIM architecture, operational module for the control and monitoring of GNSS receivers, module for generating the differential corrections and converting to RTCM format, and it then broadcasts the differential corrections to user receivers using the MSK modulator. For the performance requirements of the proposed software RSIM, the pseudorange (PR) measurement, the pseudorange corrections (PRCs) and position accuracy are presented in the Interests of performance analysis of the software RSIM. We then analyze the functionality of maritime DGNSS integrity monitoring and the key components for generations of 1M information. In addition, we present the performance analysis results of the proposed software DGNSS RSIM. Finally, our conclusions are presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "33", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "36", "date_publication": "April 2011", "inspec": "11973608", "date": "April 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu May 05 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "4", "pages": "33 - 36", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Ki-Yeol Seo", "Sang-Hyun Park", "Won-Seok Jang", "Deuk-Jae Cho"], "keywords": ["computerised monitoring", "naval engineering computing", "satellite navigation", "1M systems", "DGNSS RSIM architecture", "MSK modulator", "RS architecture", "RTCM SC-104 document", "enhanced maritime DGNSS operation", "maritime DGNSS integrity monitoring", "pseudorange corrections", "pseudorange measurement", "reference station and integrity monitor", "software RSIM design", "Design methodology", "Marine navigation", "Receivers", "Remote sensing", "Software development", ""], "arnumber": "5763343"}
