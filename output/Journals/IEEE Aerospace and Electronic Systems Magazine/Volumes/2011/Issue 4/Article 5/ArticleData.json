It is a monopulse C-band tracking radar designed to hold both systematic and random angle errors to less than 0. 1 mils* rms and range errors to less than 5 yards rms. At the time of this writing in 2010, the AN/FPS-16 and its variants remain the primary source of trajectory data at US test ranges. Along with similar radars subsequently developed in other countries, they are in use at missile test ranges worldwide.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "B1", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "B16", "date_publication": "April 2011", "inspec": "11973606", "date": "April 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu May 05 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "4", "pages": "B1 - B16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["David K.
