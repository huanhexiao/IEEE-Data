Whether wireless access may be asynchronous or synchronous (respectively as in the upcoming IEEE 802.11p Standard or in some alternative emerging solutions), a synchronization among nodes is required. Moreover, the information on position is needed to let vehicular services work and to correctly forward the messages. As a result, timing and positioning are a strong prerequisite of VANETs. Also the diffusion of enhanced GNSS Navigators paves the way to the integration between GNSS receivers and VANET transceivers. This presents an analysis on the potential benefits coming from a tight-coupling between the two: this dissertation is meant to show to what extent Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) services could benefit from the proposed architecture.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "April 2011", "inspec": "11973604", "date": "April 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu May 05 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "4", "pages": "15 - 23", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Agustin Cozzetti", "Riccardo Scopigno", "Letizia Lo Presti"], "keywords": ["satellite navigation", "vehicular ad hoc networks", "GNSS", "VANET", "intelligent transportation system services", "public safety", "tight coupling benefits", "traffic management", "traveler information support", "vehicular ad-hoc networks", "Ad hoc networks", "Global Navigation Satellite Systems", "Message systems", "Receivers", "Routing", "Traffic control", ""], "arnumber": "5763339"}
