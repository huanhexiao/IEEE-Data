The first system, called SETHI, is presented in the Sethi Sensor section. It has been developed according to the standard FAR25 applied to civil applications. The main improvement compared to the previous ONERA airborne radar system, RAMSES is that the antennas are located in two pods compatible with small aircrafts like the Falcon 20. This pod-based configuration allows the easy integration of any kind of payloads under the single certification of the pods by authorities. The Busard Platform section describes the BUSARD concept, dedicated to UAV-like payloads. Special attention is set on its Ka-band radar payload. Finally, we describe the RAMSES NG project in the self-titled section with a new installation on-board a Falcon 20 aircraft and we expose the latest X-band developments. The three systems are summarized on overview tables.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "24", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "Nov. 2011", "inspec": "12341962", "date": "Nov. 2011", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 07 00:00:00 EST 2011", "issue": "11", "pages": "24 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Olivier Ruault du Plessis", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Nouvel", "R\u00e9mi Baqu\u00e9", "Gr\u00e9gory Bonin", "Philippe Dreuillet", "Colette Coulombeix", "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Oriot"], "keywords": ["airborne radar", "aircraft instrumentation", "RAMSES NG project", "UAV-like payloads", "X-band developments", "airborne SAR systems", "antennas", "busard platform section", "civil applications", "falcon 20 aircraft", "french aerospace lab ONERA", "self-titled section", "sethi sensor section", "Airborne radar", "Payloads", "Radar antennas", "Synthetic aperture radar", "Unmanned aerial vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "6070278"}
