It also identifies procedures and technologies necessary to support activities proposed withing future operational concepts for an Integrated Arrival/Departure Control Service, Dynamic Departure Routing, and airport surface management, with a focus on near- to mid-term (2015-2018) technical capabities. This operational sequence is then utilized to identify critical human factors considerations at an abstract level. The operational sequence is organized according to a timeline and the assumed context for the scenario. All times are reported in Zulu (Greenwich Mean) Time.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "15", "date_publication": "Nov. 2011", "inspec": "12341960", "date": "Nov. 2011", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 07 00:00:00 EST 2011", "issue": "11", "pages": "4 - 15", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Alicia Borgman", "Philip J.
