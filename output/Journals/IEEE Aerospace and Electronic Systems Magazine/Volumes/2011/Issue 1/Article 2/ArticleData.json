The RF Front-End of this GNSS Baseband Logger, centered at the GPS L1 frequency, has enough bandwidth to include (or receive) GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, and Compass L1 signals without truncation which is essential for baseband processing. Existing software defined radio open source GNSS projects have been proposed, developed, and implemented into a PC Data Processing Terminal of the system with several off-line functions such as FFT-based acquisition, GPS (or GNSS) positioning, and Carrier/Noise ratio analysis. A brief description of the design and performance of the GNSS logging system is supported by the observed experimental data.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "26", "lastpage": "13", "date_publication": "Jan. 2011", "inspec": "11834521", "date": "Jan. 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 24 00:00:00 EST 2011", "issue": "1", "pages": "9 - 13", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Chen Pei", "Wang Sheng", "Han Chao"], "keywords": ["satellite navigation", "system monitoring", "telecommunication computing", "FFT-based acquisition", "GLONASS", "GNSS baseband logging system", "GPS", "Galileo", "PC data processing terminal", "RF front-end", "carrier-noise ratio analysis", "compass LI signal", "software design", "Baseband", "Global Positioning System", "Real time systems", "Satellite navigation systems", "Software design", ""], "arnumber": "5719650"}
