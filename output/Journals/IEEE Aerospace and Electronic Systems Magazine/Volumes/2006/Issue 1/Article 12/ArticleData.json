The proposed approach exploits both range information and azimuth information to estimate fractal dimension. Moreover, the approach can increase the number of the data points. The above two merits result in the fractal dimension estimated by this method is more accurate and robust than the previous method. The detection performance is also better than the previous one, which only makes use of 1-dimensional (1-D) information to estimate fractal dimension. Theoretical analysis and experimental result show that the proposed method performs well in strong clutter background. The proposed method is also validated by real-life radar data, and the better result has been achieved.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "29", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "32", "date_publication": "Jan. 2006", "inspec": "8726419", "date": "Jan. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "1", "pages": "29 - 32", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": [], "keywords": ["fractals", "radar clutter", "radar detection", "2D fractal dimension", "azimuth information", "radar target detection", "range information", "strong clutter background", "Azimuth", "Fractals", "Geometry", "Object detection", "Performance analysis", "Radar clutter", "Radar detection", "Radar imaging", "Robustness", "Stochastic processes", ""], "arnumber": "1581124"}
