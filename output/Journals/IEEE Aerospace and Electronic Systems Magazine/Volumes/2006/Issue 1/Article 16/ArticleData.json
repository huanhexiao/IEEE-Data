There are presented some examples of last generation radioshielding and radioabsorbing materials of various classes with interesting both radiophysics and operational characteristics, have been design by the authors. To achieve a good price/quality ratio and high efficiency, it is a necessary choice relevant type of microwave absorber material and construction for the current task, depending on concrete radiophysical and operational conditions of application. That's why \"Radiostrim\" company spent parallel development of several classes of materials. Each type of the listed materials possesses the advantages and disadvantages, accordingly, has the various cost price. The main concept of activity of our enterprise - to provide all spectrums of the microwave absorbers potentially required at the present stage development both in technological, and in financial, and industrial aspect.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "Jan. 2006", "inspec": "8718514", "date": "Jan. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "1", "pages": "25 - 28"}, "authors": [], "keywords": ["electromagnetic compatibility", "electromagnetic wave absorption", "electronic equipment testing", "microwave materials", "electromagnetic compatibility", "electromagnetic irradiation", "microwave absorber material", "operational characteristics", "radioabsorbing materials", "radioelectronic equipment compatibility", "radiophysics characteristics", "radioshielding material", "Biological materials", "Building materials", "Concrete", "Costs", "Electromagnetic compatibility", "Inorganic materials", "Microwave devices", "Microwave technology", "Organic materials", "Space technology", ""], "arnumber": "1581123"}
