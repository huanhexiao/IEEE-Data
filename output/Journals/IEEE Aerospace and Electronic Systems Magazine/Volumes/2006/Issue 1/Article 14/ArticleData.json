The benefits include unproved impulse response performance, i.e., reduced peak sidelobes and integrated sidelobe power, along with improved mainlobe resolution, compared to classic windowing techniques. Nonlinear apodization (NLA) techniques can also serve as powerful engines for effective superresolution and bandwidth extrapolation of coherent data for filling sparse apertures. The sparse aperture filling property of superresolution algorithms for radar data forms the basis for a new concept which is introduced here: synthetic multiple aperture radar technology (SMART). Increased swath and/or reduced antenna size are some of the benefits postulated for SMART applied to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems. The benefits of these new methods and applications for nonlinear apodization are then demonstrated for two specific applications: 1) sidelobe control for Y-type synthetic aperture radiometers, such as the European Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) system (Kerr et al.) and JPL's proposed GeoSTAR (Lambrigsten) concept; and, 2) filling of sparse synthetic aperture radar data by exploiting the bandwidth extrapolation properties of nonlinear apodization based superresolution techniques. The methods that have been developed and demonstrated herein have potential application to a wide range of passive and active microwave remote sensing and radar systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "Jan. 2006", "inspec": "8718511", "date": "Jan. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 30 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "1", "pages": "3 - 8"}, "authors": [], "keywords": ["microwave measurement", "radar antennas", "radar resolution", "remote sensing by radar", "synthetic aperture radar", "European Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity system", "GeoSTAR", "Y-type synthetic aperture radiometers", "antenna size", "bandwidth extrapolation", "impulse response performance", "irregularly-shaped apertures", "microwave radar systems", "microwave remote sensing", "nonlinear apodization", "parse coherent apertures", "sidelobe control", "sparse aperture filling property", "superresolution algorithms", "superresolution techniques", "synthetic aperture radar systems", "synthetic multiple aperture radar technology", "Aperture antennas", "Bandwidth", "Engines", "Extrapolation", "Filling", "Moisture control", "Nonlinear control systems", "Radar antennas", "Radio control", "Synthetic aperture radar", ""], "arnumber": "1581119"}
