This report describes an initial investigation into the feasibility of utilising site specific radar modelling to provide a localized estimate of the clutter statistics which can then be used to predict the required threshold to maintain a given false alarm rate. The technique has been applied to littoral clutter recordings obtained from the experimental S-band phase array radar, MESAR2. Results are presented for the technique in comparison with a conventional, non-adaptive, cell averaging CFAR. The paper concludes that significant performance enhancements are possible through the use of this new technique", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "6", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "11", "date_publication": "Sept. 2006", "inspec": "9102226", "date": "Sept. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 02 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "9", "pages": "6 - 11", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["B.
