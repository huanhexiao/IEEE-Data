The conditions present in ATC are very specific: very spontaneous, the presence of noise, and high speed speech. So, with a typical speech recognizer the recognition results are unsatisfactory. We have to decide on the best option for the modeling: to develop acoustic models specific to those conditions from scratch using the data available for the new environment, or to carry out cross-task adaptation starting from reliable HMM models (usually requiring less data in the target domain). We begin with a description of the main techniques considered for cross-task adaptation, namely maximum a posteriori (MAP), maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR), and the two together. We have applied each in two speech recognizers for air traffic control tasks, one for spontaneous speech and the other for a command interface. We show the performance of these techniques and compare them with the development of a new system from scratch. We also show the results obtained for speaker adaptation using a variable amount of adaptation data. The main conclusion is that MLLR can outperform MAP when a large number of transforms is used, and MLLR followed by MAP is the best option. All of these techniques are better than developing a new system from scratch, showing the effectiveness of mean and variance adaptation", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "12", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "17", "date_publication": "Sept. 2006", "inspec": "9102227", "date": "Sept. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 02 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "9", "pages": "12 - 17", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R. de Cordoba", "J.
