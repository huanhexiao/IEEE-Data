The system of simulation composed of tracking, navigation, telecontrol, telemetering, and flight control is introduced in this paper. The method of simulation on telemetering and telecontrol, tracking and position, and target observation and tracking is explained", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "5", "date_publication": "Sept. 2006", "inspec": "9102225", "date": "Sept. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 02 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "9", "pages": "3 - 5", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Ding Wang", "Jiadong Xu", "Rugui Yao", "Ruifeng Miao"], "keywords": ["aerospace control", "navigation", "position control", "remotely operated vehicles", "target tracking", "telecontrol", "telemetry", "Earth", "flight control", "target observation", "target tracking", "telecontrol", "telemetering", "unmanned aerial vehicle", "Aerospace control", "Computational modeling", "Computer displays", "Computer vision", "Reconnaissance", "Satellite navigation systems", "Surveillance", "Target tracking", "Transmitters", "Unmanned aerial vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "1705163"}
