The principle investigator (PI) must accept responsibility for all aspects of the mission. A wide variety of mission types have been found to fit the discovery mold, including fly-bys, orbiters, landers and even sample return missions. To enhance this fit, it has been necessary for scientists and engineers to work closely in: evaluating spacecraft risks, setting data throughput requirements and methods of their amelioration, focusing on key objectives, and deriving strict instrument and experiment requirements from overall goals and engineering realities. Discovery is loaded with challenges, but likewise, represents the most promising opportunities for affordable, frequent scientific advances in planetary exploration.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "33", "date_publication": "April 2006", "inspec": "8897232", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon May 01 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "4", "pages": "27 - 33", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["B.
