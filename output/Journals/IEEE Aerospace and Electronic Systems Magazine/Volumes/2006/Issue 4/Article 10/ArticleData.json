The challenge of narrow pulses in conjunction to low Doppler frequencies is handled here by CMOS switches and normal function generator ICs. Test noise is generated with an off-the-shelf radio RF/IF circuit. Wideband video amplifiers are not required. Typical performance figures include pulse widths from 50 ns, target ranges from 0 to ambiguity maximum, target velocities from 0.5 m/s to 500 m/s and PRFs up to 100 kflz. Virtual target RCS can be adjusted as needed in a straightforward way.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "8", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "11", "date_publication": "April 2006", "inspec": "8897229", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon May 01 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "4", "pages": "8 - 11", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
