Both missions, though very different in concept, use the same generic timekeeping system design. This paper explores how we maintain time on these spacecraft and how we establish on the ground the correlation between spacecraft time and Earth time. It further reviews the sub-millisecond correlation accuracy that has been demonstrated for the MESSENGER mission and the time accuracy we expect to achieve for that mission at Mercury and for the New Horizons mission at Pluto-Charon", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "Oct. 2006", "inspec": "9148093", "date": "Oct. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "10", "pages": "18 - 23", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Stanley B.
