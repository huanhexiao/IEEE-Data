There are two normally associated problems: qualitative and quantitative, considered. Limitations and shortcomings of radar imaging, due to inherent physical features as well as signal processing improving the quality of radar images, are discussed. Actual field data are used to illustrate applications of subsurface radar for non-destructive testing of walls' internal regions", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "28", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "31", "date_publication": "Oct. 2006", "inspec": "9148095", "date": "Oct. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 08 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "10", "pages": "28 - 31", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
