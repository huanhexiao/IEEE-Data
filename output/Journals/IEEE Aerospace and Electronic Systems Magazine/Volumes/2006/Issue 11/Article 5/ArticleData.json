Existing methods are described and problems of positioning of the vesoplan in a nonhomogenous current is stated. Use of method of dead-reckoning and its peculiarities are justified. Conclusion is made that, in this case, dead-reckoning is impossible without current field identification. Principles of current field identification and the algorithms based on them are described", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "Nov. 2006", "inspec": "9213600", "date": "Nov. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "11", "pages": "27 - 28", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
