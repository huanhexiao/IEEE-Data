This presents the architecture in the 2015 time frame when the final phases of transition take place from analog voice to digital data exchange of common data via integrated networks. The results of this transition are an integrated collection of systems and procedures that efficiently use the capacity of the NAS while balancing access to all user classes and maintaining the highest levels of safety. Efficient collaboration among users is built on a foundation of common data. This information base provides common situational awareness to all participants. All users are accommodated and will receive benefits commensurate with equipage level. This architecture development provides a technical framework for decision-making, research, and analysis of communication technologies", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "8", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "17", "date_publication": "Nov. 2006", "inspec": "9213597", "date": "Nov. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "11", "pages": "8 - 17", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Seana Gallagher", "Doug Blyth", "Steve Decker"], "keywords": ["air safety", "air traffic", "aircraft communication", "information dissemination", "integrated voice/data communication", "National Airspace System", "air traffic management", "communication system architecture", "data exchange", "weather information dissemination", "Collaboration", "Communication system traffic", "Communications technology", "Context", "Context-aware services", "Decision making", "Frequency estimation", "Information management", "L-band", "Safety", ""], "arnumber": "4062970"}
