Novelty of the radar lies in its large operational bandwidth (11.7 GHz at -10 dB level) combined with high time stability. Detection of respiratory movement of a person in laboratory conditions has been demonstrated. Based on experimental results human being radar return has been analysed in the frequency band from 1 GHz until 12 GHz. Novel principle of human being detection is considered and verified experimentally", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "22", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "Nov. 2006", "inspec": "9213599", "date": "Nov. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "11", "pages": "22 - 26", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
