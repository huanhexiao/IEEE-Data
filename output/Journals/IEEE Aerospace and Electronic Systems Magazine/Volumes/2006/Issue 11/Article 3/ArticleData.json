Both the activities to secure contents and to break security are very hot. In order to reduce the chances of attack, security needs to be made invisible. The needs to preserve originality, ownership information, and integrity of text documents in a way that cannot be identified by everyone is being felt badly. Watermarking of the documents is a step toward achieving these objectives. However, to watermark a plain text document (ASCII) in a way that the original text will not change (and it would be very difficult to break it), is a great challenge. We have developed a novel encoding scheme which can be used to insert information in plain text without changing the text. A system has been developed based upon this encoding scheme. This paper describes the system and demonstrates its workings", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "21", "date_publication": "Nov. 2006", "inspec": "9213598", "date": "Nov. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "11", "pages": "18 - 21", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Muhammad Abdul Qadir", "Ishtiaq Ahmad"], "keywords": ["data encapsulation", "document handling", "encoding", "security of data", "watermarking", "data hiding", "data secure communication", "digital documents", "digital text watermarking", "encoding scheme", "public channels", "secure content delivery", "Best practices", "Communication system security", "Data communication", "Data encapsulation", "Data security", "Information security", "Internet", "Protection", "Research and development", "Watermarking", ""], "arnumber": "4062971"}
