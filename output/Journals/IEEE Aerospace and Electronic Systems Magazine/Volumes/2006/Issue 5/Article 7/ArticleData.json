It is supposed that the methods and approaches known as real time kinematic (RTK) are incorporated in a basis of researched navigating devices and algorithms. Thus, the measurements from satellite navigating systems such as GLONASS/GPS, and also the measurements from other traditional measuring means (tactile sensors, steering wheel angle and/or inertial measuring instruments) are used in the navigating device of the MV. In the present report we solve the problems and describe the methods of a modeling research of the features of functional units algorithms of the MV navigating processor with account of a satellite navigation set integration with other measuring instruments. The improvement of these devices interaction is made by means of the computer complex \"AutoMobil,\" allowing us to simulate the certain conditions of these navigating tools operation. The imitation computer complex \"AutoMobil\" for researches of the MV navigation is developed within the frameworks of a programming environment \"Delphi-7\".", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "34", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "39", "date_publication": "May 2006", "inspec": "8934341", "date": "May 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue May 30 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "5", "pages": "34 - 39", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
