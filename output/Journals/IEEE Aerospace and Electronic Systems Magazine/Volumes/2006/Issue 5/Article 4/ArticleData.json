The transition occurs through several steps. First, the installation and use of modern navigation and surveillance equipment is mandated by the regulatory organizations. The installations should take place in a sequenced fashion to allow time for companies to absorb the initial cost. Next, the existing network of terrestrial navigation aids is down-sized leaving only the areas of heaviest use in service. At this point, the global positioning system (GPS) will be deemed the primary method of terrestrial and oceanic travel. Finally, terrestrial navigation stations will be available around airports and the remaining stations will be put in a standby condition for use in the event of a national emergency. This paper will discuss the security benefits and examples of cost savings through implementation of these steps.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "21", "date_publication": "May 2006", "inspec": "8934337", "date": "May 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue May 30 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "5", "pages": "17 - 21", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
