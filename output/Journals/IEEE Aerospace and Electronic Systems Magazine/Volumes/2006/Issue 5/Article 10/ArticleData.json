Main emphasis was placed on compactness in size and high-precise operation in performance. The fabricated radar consists of an FM Gunn oscillator, a balanced mixer, and a planar antenna fed by leaky NRD guide with a mechanically beam-scanning performance. All circuit components and the antenna were contained in a compact housing of 170 \u00d7 140 mm in area and 25 mm in thickness, and thus, a thin type of millimeter-wave radar front-end was successfully developed. Moreover, an error of distance estimation was measured to be less than a distance of 0.7 m.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "26", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "May 2006", "inspec": "8934339", "date": "May 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue May 30 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "5", "pages": "26 - 29", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["F.
