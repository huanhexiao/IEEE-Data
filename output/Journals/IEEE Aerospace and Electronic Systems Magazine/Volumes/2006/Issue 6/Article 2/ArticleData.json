Part II. High frequency AC distributed power systems", "abstract": "The present development state in high frequency (HF) AC distributed power systems (DPS) is reviewed. First, background and motivations of developing HF AC-DPS are addressed. Two types of basic HF AC-DPSs based on sine wave and square/PWM (pulsewidth modulated) wave bus are described, and the system level design considerations are discussed. Further, the issues and challenges in this research area are identified. These issues include high electromagnetic interference (EMI) level, difficulty to back up power, nonredundant system structure and limited post-regulation capability, etc. Finally, a viable HF AC-DPS is proposed, which is expected to yield effective EMI trade-off and system redundancy", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "5", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "14", "date_publication": "June 2006", "inspec": "9039107", "date": "June 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 24 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "6", "pages": "5 - 14", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["S.
