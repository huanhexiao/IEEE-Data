A knuckle image with scale, rotation, and translation invariance is isolated from the hand recorded image with digital image processing techniques. The wrinkle of the knuckle images are extracted to a black and white image which is used as biometric features. A hidden Markov model and a support vector machine are proposed as verifiers. A similar equal error We of 0.094 is reached by both classifiers with our preliminary database consisting of 8 samples of 20 people's hands", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "27", "date_publication": "June 2006", "inspec": "8998764", "date": "June 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 24 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "6", "pages": "23 - 27", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
