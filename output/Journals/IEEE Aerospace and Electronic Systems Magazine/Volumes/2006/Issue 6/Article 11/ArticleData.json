The range resolution is set by the bandwidth of the transmitted waveform, and is built up as a set of monotonically increasing stepped frequencies. As these frequencies are sampled sequentially, a constraint with SF-CW waveforms is the time restriction available to build up the bandwidth, imposed by the spatial sampling requirements along the aperture to avoid grating-lobe effects. To address this problem, an approach is outlined which allows the frequency spectrum to be greatly undersampled to provide a greater effective bandwidth. It was found that randomizing the set of frequencies omitted from sweep to sweep allowed significant thinning before the appearance of significant unwanted image artifacts due to the under-sampling. This scheme allows great flexibility in the choice of bandwidths that can be realized for a particular imaging scenario. Their application is considered from the point of view of operation from UAV SAR platforms", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "28", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "32", "date_publication": "June 2006", "inspec": "9009623", "date": "June 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 24 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "6", "pages": "28 - 32", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["K.
