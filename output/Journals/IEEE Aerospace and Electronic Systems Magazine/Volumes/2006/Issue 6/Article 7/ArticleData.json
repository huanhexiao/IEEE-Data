He discusses the importance of undergraduate engineering disciplines being taught with respect to systems engineering guidelines and how systems engineering should also be taught from a practical viewpoint. If the systems engineering process is added to the traditional engineering curriculum, it should highlight the war-fighter's or customer's needs, specifications, standards, and requirements. This paper stresses the idea that requirements engineering methodologies, a subset of systems engineering, should be taught and discusses the use of requirements engineering to derive software and hardware requirements for avionics subsystems. Definitions and applications of systems engineering methodologies to develop a technological product that succeeds from one milestone decision to another and from one life-cycle phase to the next are also covered. Finally, recommendations are made on how to better prepare pre-graduate engineers for such a workplace", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "June 2006", "inspec": "9009621", "date": "June 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 24 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "6", "pages": "3 - 8", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["S.
