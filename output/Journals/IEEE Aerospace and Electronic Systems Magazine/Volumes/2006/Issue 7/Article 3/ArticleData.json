Since pilots of UAVs are on the ground, the equipment for sensing and avoiding obstacles in front is indispensable. In this paper, the TCAS II, a collision avoidance device for manned aircraft, is implemented to UAVs and investigated for the interfaces of a flight control computer. It turns out that the onboard directional antenna of TCAS II does not provide precise direction information, and the TCAS II is not assumed to be installed alone, but used as supplement with other device which tells precise direction", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "8", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "13", "date_publication": "July 2006", "inspec": "9009625", "date": "July 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 28 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "7", "pages": "8 - 13", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Hyeon-Cheol Lee"], "keywords": ["aircraft computers", "aircraft control", "aircraft instrumentation", "collision avoidance", "remotely operated vehicles", "TCAS II", "UAV", "collision avoidance", "directional antenna", "flight control computer", "manned aircraft", "Aerospace control", "Aircraft manufacture", "Collision avoidance", "Computer interfaces", "Directional antennas", "Ground support", "Military aircraft", "Satellites", "Sensor systems", "Unmanned aerial vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "1684262"}
