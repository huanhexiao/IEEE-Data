We report further developments of a vapour phase technique, which has provided significant advantages over current melt growth technologies. Crystals of up to 50 mm in diameter have been produced with increased growth rates up to 12 mm/day", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "July 2006", "inspec": "9009626", "date": "July 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 28 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "7", "pages": "14 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["B.
