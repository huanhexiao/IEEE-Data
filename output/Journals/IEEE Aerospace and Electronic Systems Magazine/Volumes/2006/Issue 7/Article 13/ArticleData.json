The prototype has been successfully flown on Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University's experimental Cessna 310 light twin aircraft. The dual-mode system incorporates an uncooled long wave infrared sensor and a low-light level visible light imager using a common aperture. The system includes a dichroic beamsplitter that provides the same coaxial field of view to both sensors. This paper describes the design, fabrication, sensor performance, and flight test results of the enhanced vision sensor prototype", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "22", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "July 2006", "inspec": "9009632", "date": "July 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 28 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "7", "pages": "22 - 26", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["T.
