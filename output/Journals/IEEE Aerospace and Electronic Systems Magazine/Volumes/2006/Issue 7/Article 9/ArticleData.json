Students at the graduate and undergraduate levels participate in an educational program consisting of three interdependent components: space systems-related courses, space systems project work, and research. Courses range from Introduction to Space Physics to Spacecraft Design. Student project involvement is realized through a number of student-driven space systems projects completed throughout the past two decades. Students are provided opportunities to do independent study projects, honors theses, M.S. theses, and Ph.D. theses on a number of space science and space systems-related topics. Our educational goal is to prepare students at the undergraduate and graduate levels for productive careers in technical and nontechnical fields relating to space systems. Due to student interest, we are developing a certificate in Space Systems Engineering for undergraduates in the College of Engineering. Strengthening Penn State's position in space engineering are its Center for Space Research Programs, membership in the USAF's Space Education Consortium, and its role in serving as the lead institution within the Commonwealth for the Pennsylvania Space Grant Consortium", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "S_23", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "S_27", "date_publication": "July 2006", "inspec": "9020159", "date": "July 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 28 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "7", "pages": "S_23 - S_27", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["S.
