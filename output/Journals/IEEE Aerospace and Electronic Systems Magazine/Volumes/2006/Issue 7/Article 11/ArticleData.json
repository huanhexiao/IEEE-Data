This paper proposes that such a course be placed in a larger and coupled design framework, that is, that all student design groups choose or be assigned a project that considers some aspects of the design of a lunar surface structure intended for human habitation. The senior mechanical and aerospace engineering capstone design course is a two-semester six credit course sequence that is intended to expose each graduating engineering student to the full spectrum of engineering experience. A review is given of the essentials of lunar surface structures design. Example project areas are given", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "S_33", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "S_36", "date_publication": "July 2006", "inspec": "9009630", "date": "July 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 28 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "7", "pages": "S_33 - S_36", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["H.
