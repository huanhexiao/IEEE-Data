AAU has, within the last decade, chosen to focus strongly on education in space technology, not because the country lacks aerospace engineers, but because space projects require the students to think about systems rather than individual modules, while providing problems that are technically challenging for the students to solve. This combination makes the graduates very attractive for industry in general, and not only for the space industry", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "S_19", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "S_22", "date_publication": "July 2006", "inspec": "9009629", "date": "July 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 28 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "7", "pages": "S_19 - S_22", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
