Avionic system is one of the most important systems to all kinds of aircraft. For digital avionics system integration, a hybrid data bus is proposed in this development. The proposed hybrid data bus (HDB) adopts some characteristics from time trigger protocol (TTP) in conjunction with the controller area node (CAN) to simplify the data bus structure and enhance system reliability in the applications. The proposed hybrid data bus system is designed and fabricated for test as a preliminary solution. In addition to data bus system, a virtual flight instrument with geodetic information system (GIS) is integrated into cockpit display together with mobile communication surveillance for low altitude flight. The overall system integration brings in a new era of digital avionics for small aircrafts", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "21", "date_publication": "July 2006", "inspec": "9009631", "date": "July 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 28 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "7", "pages": "17 - 21", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
