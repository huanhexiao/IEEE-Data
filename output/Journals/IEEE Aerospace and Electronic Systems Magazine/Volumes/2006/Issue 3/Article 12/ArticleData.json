This report describes an initial investigation into the feasibility of utilising site-specific radar modelling to provide a localised estimate of the clutter statistics which can then be used to predict the required threshold to maintain a given false alarm rate. The technique has been applied to littoral clutter recordings obtained from the experimental S-band phased array radar, MESAR2. Results are presented for the technique in comparison with a conventional, non-adaptive, cell averaging CFAR. This paper concludes that significant performance enhancements are possible through the use of this new technique.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "26", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "March 2006", "inspec": "8849504", "date": "March 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 24 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "3", "pages": "26 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["B.
