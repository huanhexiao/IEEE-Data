In addition to a performance analysis of the system, a pre- and post-data collection survey was distributed to the 129 test subjects gathering information on perceptions of biometrics, in particular hand geometry, as well as participants' thoughts and feelings during their interaction with the hand geometry device. The results of the survey suggest that participants were accepting of hand geometry. Additionally, analyses of the participants' survey responses revealed that 93% liked using hand geometry, 98% thought it was easy to use, and 87% preferred it to the existing card-based system, while nobody thought the device invaded their personal privacy. System performance achieved a 3-try match rate of 99.02% (FRR 0.98%) when \"gaming\"/potential impostor attempts were removed from analysis. The failure to enroll rate was zero. Statistical analyses exposed a significant difference in the scores of attempts made by users with prior hand geometry usage, and subjects that could not straighten out their hand on the device. However, there were no statistical difference in the effects of rings/no rings, improper hand placements/proper hand placements, or gender on hand geometry score.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "9", "date_publication": "March 2006", "inspec": "8849499", "date": "March 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 24 00:00:00 EDT 2006", "issue": "3", "pages": "3 - 9", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["E.
