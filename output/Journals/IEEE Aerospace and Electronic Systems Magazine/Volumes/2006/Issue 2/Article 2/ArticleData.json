Therefore, since the physical world is fundamentally quantum mechanical, the foundations of information theory and computer science should be sought in quantum physics. In fact, quantum information has weird properties that contrast sharply with the familiar properties of classical information. A quantum computer-a new type of machine that exploits the quantum properties of information could perform certain types of calculations far more efficiently than any foreseeable classical computer. To build a functional quantum computer will be an enormous technical challenge. New methods for quantum error correction are being developed that can help to prevent a quantum computer from crashing.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "11", "date_publication": "Dec. 2006", "inspec": "8793924", "date": "Dec. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "2", "pages": "3 - 11", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["John Preskill"], "keywords": ["aerospace control", "aerospace testing", "learning (artificial intelligence)", "neurocontrollers", "nonlinear control systems", "optimal control", "reconfigurable architectures", "remotely operated vehicles", "stability", "airplane stability", "crossbow inertial measurement", "flight performance metrics", "hardware-in-the-loop testing", "nonlinear flight control", "online learning neural network", "optimal controller", "reconfigurable controller", "reconfigurable flight control", "single network adaptive critic", "spaceage control", "system identification", "unmanned aircraft", "Aerospace control", "Aircraft", "Airplanes", "Control systems", "Neural networks", "Optimal control", "Performance analysis", "Stress control", "System identification", "Unmanned aerial vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "1599135"}
