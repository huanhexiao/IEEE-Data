High-resolution imaging sensors such as the inverse synthetic aperture radar perform this action in the most effective way and are especially useful against low radar cross-section targets. Once the correct target is acquired and identified, the decision to engage is made and the weapons are selected. Counter-targeting is the attempt to prevent (or degrade) the engage-and-launch-weapons decision by the enemy. This paper describes an all-digital image synthesizer technique capable of generating realistic false-target images for counter-targeting using modern digital radio frequency memory technology. Uses in counter-lock on for coherent seekers in the terminal mode are also discussed. Examples of the output false target image capability are presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "2", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "2", "date_publication": "Dec. 2006", "inspec": "8793923", "date": "Dec. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "2", "pages": "2", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
