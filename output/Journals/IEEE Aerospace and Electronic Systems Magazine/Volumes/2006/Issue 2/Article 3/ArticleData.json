This sensor constitutes a vehicle-housed emergency system for surveillance of area with vegetation ahead on the path of moving vehicle to prevent its contact with hidden objects. The emergency system functioning in basically implemented by real-time electromagnetic imaging of the scene of interest and its following image processing to enhance the target responses. The developed and tested experimental radar techniques are under consideration. The results of experimental examinations in field are presented and discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "12, 14, 15", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "Dec. 2006", "date": "Dec. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 27 00:00:00 EST 2006", "issue": "2", "pages": "12, 14, 15 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Anatoliy A.
