The \"skeleton diagram\" of a trench image has been developed. The strategy of GPR searching for low radar contrast plastic pipes in ground (in back-filled trenches) has been considered on the basis of indirect criterion which is the existence of a trench containing buried pipes", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "Dec. 2006", "inspec": "9213605", "date": "Dec. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "12", "pages": "23 - 26", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["L. a.
