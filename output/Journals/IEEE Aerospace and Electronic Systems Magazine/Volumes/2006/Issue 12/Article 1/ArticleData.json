Therefore, since the physical world is fundamentally quantum mechanical, the foundations of information theory and computer science should be sought in quantum physics. In fact, quantum information has weird properties that contrast sharply with the familiar properties of classical information. A quantum computer - a new type of machine that exploits the quantum properties of information - could perform certain types of calculations far more efficiently than any foreseeable classical computer. To build a functional quantum computer will be an enormous technical challenge. New methods for quantum error correction are being developed that can help to prevent a quantum computer from crashing", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "11", "date_publication": "Dec. 2006", "inspec": "9213602", "date": "Dec. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "12", "pages": "3 - 11", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["John Preskill"], "keywords": ["information theory", "quantum computing", "quantum theory", "computer science", "error correction", "information theory", "quantum computation", "quantum information", "quantum mechanical", "quantum physics", "Computer science", "Electron tubes", "Error correction", "Information technology", "Information theory", "Physics computing", "Quantum computing", "Quantum mechanics", "Space technology", "Watches", ""], "arnumber": "4062946"}
