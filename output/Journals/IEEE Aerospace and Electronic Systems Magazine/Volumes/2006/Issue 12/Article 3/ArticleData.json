As well, the production of testing protocols and industry standards has been developed by national organisations, professional security, and engineering bodies in the appropriate security fields. The Security Systems Research and Testing Laboratory in the School of Engineering and Mathematics at Edith Cowan University (ECU), Perth, Western Australia has commenced operations in research, testing, and evaluation of security systems. This paper will describe the first year of operation of the Security Systems Research and Testing Laboratory, and will describe the role that testing and evaluation of security systems plays in the education and training of Security Science graduates, as well as the benefits that the Laboratory brings to the security industry through its testing programme", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "Dec. 2006", "inspec": "9213604", "date": "Dec. 2006", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 15 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "12", "pages": "19 - 22", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Clifton L.
