The concept presented has been verified via the processing of the data recorded during a measurement campaign carried out in a real operational scenario. The results presented in the paper show that a GSM-based PCL system can be used successfully in the future as a new system dedicated to speed control and traffic monitoring, both in urban areas and on small roads and highways. The results presented in the paper show that the system is able to simultaneously distinguish different-sized objects, characterized by different RCSs, as in the example of the truck and cyclist. This result shows the high potential of the proposed system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "43", "volume": "27", "lastpage": "51", "date_publication": "Oct. 2012", "inspec": "13167653", "date": "Oct. 2012", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 04 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "10", "pages": "43 - 51", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
