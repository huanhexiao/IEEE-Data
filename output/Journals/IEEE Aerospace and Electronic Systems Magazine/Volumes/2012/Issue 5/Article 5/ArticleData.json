It is valuable to note that the constituents could vary from case-to-case and are also time-dependent due to the dynamic nature of SoS and the environment in which it operates. Furthermore, the authors pointed out the importance of the application of systemic risk in the SoS domain and thus understanding the interconnectedness between the various constituents.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "27", "lastpage": "27", "date_publication": "May 2012", "date": "May 2012", "date_current_version": "Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "23 - 27", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["S.
