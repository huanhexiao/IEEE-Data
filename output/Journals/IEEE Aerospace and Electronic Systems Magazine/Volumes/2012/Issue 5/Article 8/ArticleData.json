We account for low wind speed oil look-alikes by comparing ASCAT measurements against NWP data. The estimated size and shape validates well with NOAA estimates for most of the spill. It is remarkable that a relatively coarse resolution spaceborne radar can map the oil spill - this method would not work as well for smaller oil spills or those spanning a shorter time period. This attests to how large of an impact the Deepwater Horizon oil spill made.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "42", "volume": "27", "lastpage": "43", "date_publication": "May 2012", "date": "May 2012", "date_current_version": "Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "42 - 43", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Richard D.
