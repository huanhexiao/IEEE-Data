The use of these techniques for intra-spacecraft communications reduces the effect of take-off acceleration and vibrations on the systems by avoiding the need for rugged connectors and provides a significant mass reduction. Diffuse transmission also eases the design process as terminals can be placed almost anywhere without a tight planification to ensure the proper system behaviour. Previous studies [3,4] have compared the performance of radio-frequency and infrared optical communications. In an intra-satellite environment optical techniques help reduce EMI related problems, and their main disadvantages - multipath dispersion and the need for line-of-sight - can be neglected due to the reduced cavity size. Channel studies [5] demonstrate that the effect of the channel can be neglected in small environments if data bandwidth is lower than some hundreds of MHz.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "36", "volume": "27", "lastpage": "41", "date_publication": "May 2012", "date": "May 2012", "date_current_version": "Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "36 - 41", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["E.
