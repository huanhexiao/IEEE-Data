The performance of the algorithm was impacted by the fluctuating behavior of the FM radio signal, although less than expected. The simulations also showed that two targets, not resolved in the individual channels, are resolved by using the proposed algorithm properly. Single scatterer targets may be significantly better positioned by the improved resolution (and as a consequence, also the accuracy) capabilities, i.e., 10 times the best performing individual channel.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "27", "lastpage": "14", "date_publication": "November 2012", "inspec": "13172422", "date": "November 2012", "date_current_version": "Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "11", "pages": "4 - 14", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Karl Erik Olsen", "Karl Woodbridge"], "keywords": ["FM radar", "passive radar", "radar resolution", "wireless channels", "multiband passive bistatic radar processing scheme", "radar resolution", "real-life FM radio signal waveform", "single scatterer theory", "Bistatic radar", "Frequency modulation", "Passive radar", "Radio communication", "Signal analysis", "Signal resolution", "Simulation", ""], "arnumber": "6380821"}
