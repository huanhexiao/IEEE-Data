The 2D planar array used could now be optimised, as several constraints considered during that validation phase seem to be no longer justified.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "27", "lastpage": "35", "date_publication": "November 2012", "inspec": "13172424", "date": "November 2012", "date_current_version": "Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "11", "pages": "27 - 35", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Dominique Poullin", "Marc Flecheux", "Mathieu Klein"], "keywords": ["angular measurement", "digital video broadcasting", "optimisation", "radio receivers", "2D DVB receiving array", "2D planar array", "SFN broadcasting", "elevation angle measurement", "optimisation", "receiver", "Accuracy", "Digital video broadcasting", "Elevation measurement", "Passive radar", "Planar arrays", "Receivers", "Target tracking", "Two dimensional displays", ""], "arnumber": "6380823"}
