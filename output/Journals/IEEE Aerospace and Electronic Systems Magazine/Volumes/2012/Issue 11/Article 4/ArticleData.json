In most cases, this altitude estimation satisfied our objectives, even though they were quite ambitious objectives. A system such as this one should clearly distinguish the different altitudes of different flight patterns, and the difference between the two altitudes was equal to 330 m. This multistatic DVB-T SFN tracker is exploiting detections based on a 2D planar DVB-T receiving array: the parameters estimated are the bistatic range and Doppler, as well as the azimuth and elevation measurements. Some opportunistic targets have also been analyzed for validation of the 3D localization capacities, especially for low speed targets at very low altitude.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "36", "volume": "27", "lastpage": "41", "date_publication": "November 2012", "inspec": "13172425", "date": "November 2012", "date_current_version": "Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "11", "pages": "36 - 41", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Dominique Poullin", "Marc Flecheux"], "keywords": ["Doppler measurement", "Global Positioning System", "array signal processing", "digital video broadcasting", "height measurement", "target tracking", "2D planar DVB-T receiving array", "3D localization capacity", "Doppler range", "GPS", "SFN broadcaster", "altitude estimation", "azimuth measurement", "bistatic range", "elevation measurement", "flight pattern", "parameter estimation", "passive 3D target tracking", "single frequency network", "Bistatic radar", "Digital video broadcasting", "Passive radar", "Target tracking", "Three dimensional displays", ""], "arnumber": "6380824"}
