A number of studies have looked at the use of different analogue signals such as FM radio and UHF television broadcasts, as well as digital transmissions such as DAB, DVB, and GSM. In the above applications, PBR is rapidly reaching a point of maturity. Basically, even though there are still many challenges to be solved involving both technology development and processing techniques, PBR practical feasibility for long-range surveillance purposes has been well established.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "27", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "November 2012", "inspec": "13172423", "date": "November 2012", "date_current_version": "Thu Dec 13 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "11", "pages": "15 - 26", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Paolo Falcone", "Fabiola Colone", "Pierfrancesco Lombardo"], "keywords": ["passive radar", "radar computing", "search radar", "wireless LAN", "DAB", "DVB", "FM radio", "GSM", "PBR", "UHF television broadcasting", "WiFi-based passive bistatic radar", "analogue signal", "digital transmission", "long-range surveillance purpose", "Bistatic radar", "Digital video broadcasting", "GSM", "IEEE 802.11 standards", "Passive radar", "Surveillance", "TV", ""], "arnumber": "6380822"}
