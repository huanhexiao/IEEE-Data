A study and analysis needs to be performed in order to determine the system requirements and the feasibility of modifying a currently existing radar system to adequately perform the required functions. This has described a methodology for determining if and how, existing airborne or ground-based MTI radar systems could be modified to perform these functions.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "27", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "June 2012", "inspec": "13038463", "date": "June 2012", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 11 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "11 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["John J.
