The system is capable of generating replies in real-time from 4000 distinct identity mobile targets for SSR/IFF modes 1, 2, 3/A, C, and 4, situated at a distance from 0 to 600 km from the interrogator being tested. The system is additionally able to generate FRUIT replies and to interface with or emulate an SSR/IFF antenna. The system furthermore allows for the creation of target crossing scenarios for generating advanced garbled reply situations.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "27", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "June 2012", "inspec": "13038464", "date": "June 2012", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 11 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "17 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Sharef Neemat", "Michael Inggs"], "keywords": ["digital systems", "military radar", "search radar", "FRUIT", "SSR-IFF target emulator", "advanced garbled reply situation generation", "distance 0 km to 600 km", "distinct identity mobile targets", "interrogator", "target crossing scenario", "Aircraft manufacture", "Design methodology", "Emulators", "Military communication", "Radar tracking", "Real-time systems", "Surveillance", "Target tracking", "Testing", ""], "arnumber": "6328549"}
