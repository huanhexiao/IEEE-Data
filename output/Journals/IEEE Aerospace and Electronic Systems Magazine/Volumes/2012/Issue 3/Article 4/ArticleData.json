We have selected an outstanding list of speakers who are experts in their fields. The AES Society will pay reasonable speaker's expenses for economy-class travel, lodging, and meals. As a general guideline, speaker's expenses involving travel wholly within North America or within the European Union will be covered up to $1000. Expenses involving extensive international travel will be covered up to $2000. The Society encourages arrangements whereby more than one lecture is presented in a single trip, and costs in such situtions will be considered on a case-by-case basis. This inviting organization is expected to cover 50% of the speaker's expenses.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "45", "volume": "27", "lastpage": "45", "date_publication": "March 2012", "date": "March 2012", "date_current_version": "Mon May 07 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "45", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Iram J.
