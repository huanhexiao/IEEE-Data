SRR is based on local self-similarity descriptor, according to the characteristics of small infrared targets. Using the SRR, the certainty of small targets can be easily measured. Compared to some conventional cutter removal methods, extensive experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms these methods. Additionally, the proposed approach has a simple structure, which is convenient for implementation. Plans for future research include incorporating efficiently temporal information to further improve detection performance.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "27", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "March 2012", "inspec": "12712298", "date": "March 2012", "date_current_version": "Mon May 07 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "21 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Chenqiang Gao", "Tianqi Zhang", "Qiang Li"], "keywords": ["image representation", "infrared imaging", "object detection", "cutter removal methods", "local self-similarity descriptor", "single image", "small infrared target detection", "small infrared targets", "sparse ring representation", "Artificial intelligence", "Clutter", "Filtering", "Image recognition", "Infrared detectors", "Photodetectors", "Target recognition", ""], "arnumber": "6196254"}
