By the 2025 timeframe aircraft operations are expected to double [1]. Well-founded concerns doubt that current air transportation systems will be able to cope with this growth, e.g., already VHF (Very High Frequency) communication capacity is expected to saturate in Europe by 2020-2025 [2]. Meeting these growing demands require systems providing flight information and processes in real-time including high flexibility. Also new security requirements are affecting the ability to move people and cargo efficiently. Ongoing research activities, projects, and programs are developing the fundamental methods, concepts, and technologies for future aeronautical communications enabling higher capacities in air transportation. In the following section, we give an overview of the current status, major activities and trends in the field of aeronautical communications. Finally, the European research project SANDRA (Seamless Aeronautical Networking through integration of Data links, Radios, and Antennas) is introduced and its recent results toward a seamless networking design are presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "27", "lastpage": "27", "date_publication": "September 2012", "inspec": "13150311", "date": "September 2012", "date_current_version": "Mon Dec 03 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "9", "pages": "21 - 27", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["S.
