Based on the imaging parameters (the horizontal and vertical angle of field of view, the imaging distance, and the elevation), the imaging size of the building target can be determined in real time, and then the SE, which has a high correlation with the target's imaging size, has been generated. Additionally, to improve the performance of target detection and straight-line extraction, the line segment grouping method and the gradient-based straight-line extraction method are adopted. Experimental results show the algorithm can recognize the prominent building object with higher local contrast in FLIR image sequences in dense urban areas and maintain higher performance.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "6", "volume": "27", "lastpage": "17", "date_publication": "Dec. 2012", "inspec": "13191045", "date": "Dec. 2012", "date_current_version": "Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "12", "pages": "6 - 17", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Li Zhang", "Tianxu Zhang", "Fan Peng", "Xiaoping Wang", "Yaxun Wei"], "keywords": ["buildings (structures)", "image recognition", "image sequences", "object detection", "FLIR image sequences", "building recognition", "dense urban areas", "forward looking infrared imagery", "gradient based straight line extraction method", "line segment grouping method", "midwave calibrated camera", "morphology based building target detection", "morphology based method", "Buildings", "Cameras", "Image recognition", "Image sequences", "Infrared imaging", "Object detection", "Real-time systems", "Urban areas", ""], "arnumber": "6397658"}
