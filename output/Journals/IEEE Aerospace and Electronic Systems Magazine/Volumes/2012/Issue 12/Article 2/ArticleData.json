Investigations into the relative attitude control of satellite formations are important for the applications of future space missions. This article addresses two issues concerning the coordinated attitude control of satellite formation flying: (1) decentralized coordination strategies of multiple satellites flying in formation and (2) coordinated controller design. Under the assumption that the relative position and attitude are known, a fully decentralized variable uncertainties and environmental disturbance torques and achieve the attitude coordination among the multiple satellites flying in formation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "27", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "Dec. 2012", "inspec": "13191046", "date": "Dec. 2012", "date_current_version": "Fri Dec 28 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "12", "pages": "18 - 25", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Yunhua Wu", "Xibin Cao", "Pengfei Zheng", "Zhankui Zeng"], "keywords": ["artificial satellites", "attitude control", "control system synthesis", "decentralised control", "robust control", "variable structure systems", "attitude coordination", "coordinated attitude control", "coordinated controller design", "decentralized coordination strategies", "environmental disturbance torques", "fully decentralized variable uncertainties", "robust architectures", "satellite formation flying", "space missions", "variable structure-based decentralized relative attitude-coordinated control", "Attitude control", "Robust control", "Satellite formations", "Satellite navigation systems", ""], "arnumber": "6397659"}
