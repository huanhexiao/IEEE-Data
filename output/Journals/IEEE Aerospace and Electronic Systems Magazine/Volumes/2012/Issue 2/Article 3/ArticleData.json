Upon completion, a course of controlled testing and experiments were conducted to verify the performance of the radar. The validity of the imaging was confirmed by running tests in the laboratory which extended to the field measurements. Polarimetric images have been produced and shown virtual imaging of the target This radar system may be useful and necessary for future sensor design and space technology development.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "27", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "Feb. 2012", "inspec": "12571557", "date": "Feb. 2012", "date_current_version": "Mon Mar 05 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "23 - 28", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
