This has presented a theoretical and experimental study of an ADS prototype. Several experiments have proved that the attitude accuracy of ADS is similar with PHINS. Its size, weight, and power consumption make it particularly suitable as an attitude measurement system of small vehicles for which precise attitude is critical. The experimental results showed that level attitude errors which are proposed by ADS are 0.05\u00b0 and the heading keeps consistent with PHINS. When the experiments are carried out respectively under the heading changed slowly and abruptly, the attitude errors are less than 0.1\u00b0. Therefore, the proposed attitude determination system is highly beneficial in providing accurate attitude of vehicles for several suburban geolocation and navigation applications [9].", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "32", "volume": "27", "lastpage": "38", "date_publication": "April 2012", "inspec": "12746911", "date": "April 2012", "date_current_version": "Wed May 23 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "32 - 38", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Wei Sun", "Ai-Gong Xu", "Yang Gao"], "keywords": ["attitude measurement", "fibre optic gyroscopes", "inertial navigation", "ADS", "FOG", "PHINS", "attitude determination system", "attitude errors", "fiber optic gyroscope", "navigation", "suburban geolocation system", "Gyroscopes", "Navigation", "Optical fibers", "Optical imaging", "Position measurement", "Radio frequency", ""], "arnumber": "6203716"}
