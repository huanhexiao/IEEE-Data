From the obtained result, the performance of developed integrated navigation and workflow of the scheme is found correct. Particular attention was focused on the ability of the navigation filter to identify and remove the IMU errors. Along the UAV trajectory the performance of integrated navigation is found to be consistent. Velocity corrections exhibited to be somewhat inefficient, however in the medium accuracy IMU and low-grade GPS, the measurement did not permit the desired level of accuracy. Future work for solving the above-mentioned problems to further improve the performance of integrated navigation is required.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "39", "volume": "27", "lastpage": "42", "date_publication": "April 2012", "inspec": "12746912", "date": "April 2012", "date_current_version": "Wed May 23 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "39 - 42", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Syed Zahid Jamal"], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "inertial navigation", "units (measurement)", "IMU errors removal", "UAV trajectory", "airborne vehicle", "inertial measurement unit", "integrated navigation", "low-grade GPS", "medium accuracy IMU", "navigation filter", "tightly coupled GPS-INS airborne navigation system", "velocity corrections", "Airborne radar", "Aircraft navigation", "Global Positioning System", "ISO standards", "Measurement uncertainty", "Navigation", "Velocity control", ""], "arnumber": "6203717"}
