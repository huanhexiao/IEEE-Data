The accuracy of the prognosticated remaining useful life depends on the level of details captured in the model, and the level of confidence from validation efforts.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "16", "volume": "27", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "April 2012", "inspec": "12746909", "date": "April 2012", "date_current_version": "Wed May 23 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "16 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Jonas Johansson", "Peter Leisner"], "keywords": ["aerospace components", "aerospace safety", "avionics", "failure (mechanical)", "fatigue", "power consumption", "reliability", "remaining life assessment", "solders", "RUL calculations", "avionic equipment", "host system", "initial reliability calculations", "low-end computer", "power consumption", "prognostic system", "prognosticated remaining useful life", "real-time fatigue calculations", "safety-critical operation performance", "solder joints thermal fatigue failure pronostics", "uncompressed temperature data", "Corrosion", "Delamination", "Electric breakdown", "Electromigration", "Fatigue", "Joining processes", "Soldering", "Thermal analysis", ""], "arnumber": "6203714"}
