Prior to this technology, performance checks were largely based on measuring and comparing receiver sensitivity and transmitter power with specifications and tolerances. A nearby corner reflector or target of known location could be used to calibrate range and antenna position but with drawbacks. When a corner reflector is used, the target signal can be obscured by ground clutter. In the case of tracking radars, scintillation effects cause the radar beam to wander over the target and nearby clutter.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "8", "volume": "27", "lastpage": "15", "date_publication": "April 2012", "inspec": "12746908", "date": "April 2012", "date_current_version": "Wed May 23 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "8 - 15", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["John E.
