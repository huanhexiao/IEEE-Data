Both mm-wave transceiver and baseband DSP have been discussed. The evolution in semiconductor technologies allows the low-cost and low-power integration of mm-wave radar transceiver and DSP unit in the same CMOS chip with performances suitable for several radar applications: automotive, e-health, security, vital signs detection to name just a few. Since DSP and A/D converter are already available as single-chip CMOS solutions we foresee the future migration from single-board radar to single-package or even single-chip radar systems. For SRR operating at several tens of GHz the on-chip integration of the antenna becomes feasible.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "27", "lastpage": "36", "date_publication": "Jan. 2012", "inspec": "12509384", "date": "Jan. 2012", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 06 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "25 - 36", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Bruno Neri", "Sergio Saponara"], "keywords": ["CMOS digital integrated circuits", "analogue-digital conversion", "digital signal processing chips", "low-power electronics", "millimetre wave antennas", "millimetre wave radar", "radar antennas", "radar detection", "transceivers", "A/D converter", "baseband DSP", "highly-integrated low-power radars", "millimetre wave radar transceiver", "on-chip integration", "radar antenna", "radar applications", "single-board radar", "single-chip CMOS solutions", "single-chip radar systems", "BiCMOS integrated circuits", "CMOS integrated circuits", "Digital signal processing", "Heterojunction bipolar transistors", "Radar antennas", "Radar applications", "System-on-a-chip", ""], "arnumber": "6145438"}
