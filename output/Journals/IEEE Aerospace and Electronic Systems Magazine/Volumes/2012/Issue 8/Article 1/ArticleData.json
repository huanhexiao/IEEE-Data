We have presented a theoretical and experimental study of the IMU rotation. Several experiments have proven that the combination of the SINS with IMU rotation achieves very high performance. SINS size and weight make it particularly suitable as the position measurement system of the small vehicles for which precise position with meter or sub-meter level is a critical issue. The experimental results showed that, the position errors which are calculated by SINS with IMU rotation, are much less than IMU static. Where, the position error which is caused by IMU double-axis rotation is 1.47 nm, which is much less than IMU single-axis rotation 6.06 nm. Therefore, the proposed position determination method is highly beneficial in providing accurate position of vehicle for several navigation applications, such as Missile boat and helicopter take off and landing platform on the aircraft carrier, etc.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "27", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "August 2012", "inspec": "13038471", "date": "August 2012", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 11 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "8", "pages": "4 - 10", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Wei Sun", "Ai-Gong Xu", "Li-Na Che", "Yang Gao"], "keywords": ["aircraft navigation", "fibre optic gyroscopes", "inertial navigation", "position measurement", "IMU double-axis rotation motion", "IMU single-axis rotation", "SINS", "aircraft carrier", "fiber optic gyroscope", "helicopter", "missile boat", "navigation application", "position determination method", "position error", "position measurement system", "size 1.47 nm", "size 6.06 nm", "submeter level", "Accuracy", "Aerospace control", "Aircraft navigation", "Navigation", "Rotation measurement", "Sensors", ""], "arnumber": "6329155"}
