Though not originally designed with data broadcast capabilities, Loran's versatility has enabled data to be broadcast with great benefits. Research in the last two decades has resulted in a tremendous increase in the data capacity of Loran thereby increasing its utility. Currently, a modernized Loran is being evaluated for its capability to backup GPS and data modulation is an integral part of this Loran design. An overview and analysis of Loran modulation techniques is provided.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "51", "date_publication": "Sept. 2007", "inspec": "9686307", "date": "Sept. 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 15 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "9", "pages": "31 - 51", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Sherman C.
