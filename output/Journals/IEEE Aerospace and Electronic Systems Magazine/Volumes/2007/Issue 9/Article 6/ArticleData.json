Enhancements to performance, reliability, and cost of ownership are being applied continuously to these systems: routine in-service life extensions mandate continuing vacuum electronics research and development to support system needs for the foreseeable future. In addition, exciting advances in vacuum electronics will provide dramatic improvements in millimeter-wave radar resolution, broadband low-noise power at microwave frequencies, compact high power sources operating at lower voltages, and life-cycle cost improvement. Recent progress in key enabling technologies, e.g., advanced device modeling and micro-fabrication, is expected to continue. This reviews the status and trends of vacuum electronics, with selected applications emphasizing recent advances in device performance in the microwave regime: multiple-beam klystrons (MBKs), microwave power modules (MPMs), and gyro-amplifiers in the millimeter-wave regime.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "28", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "34", "date_publication": "Sept. 2007", "inspec": "9686306", "date": "Sept. 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 15 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "9", "pages": "28 - 34", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Baruch Levush", "David K.
