The necessity of IT as well as the complexity of IT-based solutions has increased. The technology of the Internet and distributed processing enable information processing in a geographically broad area. The IT awareness and the technological sophistication of users produce a large number of educated hackers and cyber criminals. Companies worry about this threat and are willing (forced) to invest in improving the safety characteristics of their IT systems. Sophisticated security equipment and excellent aviation security requirements are not sufficient to assure efficient aviation security services. The human being continues to be the most important factor in the security process.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "27", "date_publication": "Sept. 2007", "inspec": "9631534", "date": "Sept. 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 15 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "9", "pages": "23 - 27", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Rudolf Volner", "Vladimir Smrz"], "keywords": ["Internet", "security of data", "travel industry", "IT-based solutions", "Internet", "air company", "aviation security requirements", "aviation security services", "cyber criminals", "distributed processing", "educated hackers", "information processing", "information systems", "information technology", "security equipment", "security systems", "Computer security", "Distributed processing", "Human factors", "Information processing", "Information security", "Information systems", "Information technology", "Internet", "Personnel", "Safety", ""], "arnumber": "4350255"}
