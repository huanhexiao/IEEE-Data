Significantly, these studies can be performed early in the mission cycle. These synthetic terrains are generated on parallel, high-performance computers and served to remote simulations at near-interactive speeds. The terrain creation uses a realistic sequence of physical phenomena such as cratering and dusting with parametric control of features such as surface roughness and rock density. Terrain resolution may be arbitrary but typically ranges from 0.01 to 10 meters. The terrain server has been used for two rover simulations, one using the actual Sojourner autonomy flight code, and the other a more general algorithm. Monte Carlo studies of rover designs interacting with synthetic environments were executed in parallel to quickly compute performance statistics and risk estimates.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "20", "date_publication": "July 2007", "inspec": "9621448", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "7", "pages": "14 - 20", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Robert Gaskell", "Laura Ekroot Husman", "James B.
