However, collections of windmills, known as wind farms, cause interference in radars that are critical to air defense and air traffic systems. Therefore, to maintain and, perhaps, improve air surveillance, methods that mitigate the inevitable performance degradation seen in radar systems must be proven and implemented to deal with wind farms as they become more prevalent. Herein, the authors discuss recommended techniques for wind farm mitigation, which are based on a UK Royal Air Force-sponsored demonstration on a Watchman radar, conducted at Clatter, South Wales. Specifically, false alarm and false track reductions will be quantified.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "35", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "40", "date_publication": "July 2007", "inspec": "9616521", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "7", "pages": "35 - 40", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["James Perry", "Andrew Biss"], "keywords": ["air traffic", "airborne radar", "radar clutter", "radar detection", "wind turbines", "air defense systems", "air surveillance radar", "air traffic systems", "false alarm reductions", "false track reductions", "performance degradation", "renewable energy resource", "wind farm clutter mitigation", "Blades", "Doppler radar", "Interference", "Radar clutter", "Radar cross section", "Radar detection", "Radar tracking", "Surveillance", "Turbines", "Wind farms", ""], "arnumber": "4285990"}
