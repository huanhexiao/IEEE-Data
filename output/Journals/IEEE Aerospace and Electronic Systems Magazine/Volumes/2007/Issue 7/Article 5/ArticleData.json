The solar probe design is a result of over two decades of studies that have allowed the evolution of both the mission and trajectory design, as well as the spacecraft configurations. During these studies some of the most significant design challenges have been the trajectory design, the spacecraft shield design, the spacecraft configuration, the telecommunications near perihelion, science instrument accommodations, and minimizing mission cost. This latter challenge (minimum cost) permeates all other design issues suggesting specific solutions consistent with this constraint. This presents the evolution and rationale that have taken place to arrive at the current design for this challenging mission.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "July 2007", "inspec": "9684753", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "7", "pages": "21 - 28", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["James Randolph", "Alexander Eremenko", "Robert Miyake", "Raymond Dirl"], "keywords": ["Sun", "aerospace instrumentation", "space research", "space vehicles", "Solar Probe mission", "Sun", "mission cost minimization", "science instrument accommodation", "space telecommunication", "spacecraft configuration", "spacecraft shield design", "trajectory design", "Costs", "Downlink", "Earth", "Probes", "Propulsion", "Space technology", "Space vehicles", "Sun", "Telemetry", "Temperature", ""], "arnumber": "4285987"}
