The SCS could be carried on a rover and a rover arm-mounted coring tool could acquire samples and deposit the samples in the SCS. The SCS would transfer the samples into a sample container, with each sample in a separate sleeve. Important to the SCS design is the ability to seal each sleeve, and the sample with it, to isolate it from other samples and from the external environment. Sealing of the samples will allow for maintaining the integrity of organic materials over many years thereby allowing the samples to be analyzed in later missions or after a return trip to Earth.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "29", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "34", "date_publication": "July 2007", "inspec": "9617564", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 08 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "7", "pages": "29 - 34", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Paul Backes", "Curtis Collins"], "keywords": ["aerospace engineering", "aerospace instrumentation", "aerospace robotics", "planetary rovers", "remote handling equipment", "SCS design", "Sample Caching Subsystem concept", "core sample storage", "core sample transfer", "planetary missions", "rover arm mounted coring tool", "soil sample storage", "soil sample transfer", "Containers", "Earth", "Instruments", "Laboratories", "Mars", "Organic materials", "Propulsion", "Sampling methods", "Seals", "Soil", ""], "arnumber": "4285988"}
