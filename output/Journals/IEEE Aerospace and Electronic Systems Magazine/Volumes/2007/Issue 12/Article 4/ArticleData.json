Currently, NASA has satellites in orbit that can identify broad regions to explore in its search for life. NASA also has instruments that can examine samples of Martian soil to see if they contain any indications of biological activity. This leaves the problem of deciding specifically where to look for suitable samples in the large area around a landing site. This also describes a robot system that can rapidly search thousands of square meters around the landing position to find sources of biogenic gas samples that may harbor important clues in the search for extra-terrestrial life.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "Dec. 2007", "inspec": "9726670", "date": "Dec. 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "12", "pages": "23 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Gary T.
