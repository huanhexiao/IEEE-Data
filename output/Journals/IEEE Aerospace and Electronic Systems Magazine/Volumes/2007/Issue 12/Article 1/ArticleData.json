The GADA model has been developed and evaluated through simulations and flight test campaigns, which comprised static and dynamic flight profiles, to best characterize the algorithm performance. As attitude reference a complete flight tests instrumentation (FTI) system was integrated into the testbed for the flight test campaign. The attitude measurements given by GADA and REQUEST algorithms are compared with those given by FTI (i.e., reference system). The results show that GADA accuracy is significantly better than that of REQUEST, for all flight conditions.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "Dec. 2007", "inspec": "9726669", "date": "Dec. 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "12", "pages": "3 - 10", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["N.
