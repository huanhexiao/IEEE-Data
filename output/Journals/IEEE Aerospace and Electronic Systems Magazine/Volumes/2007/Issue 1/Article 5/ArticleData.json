During the last five years our lab has tested and verified various approaches to the image compression for security purposes and the evaluation of subjective image quality. In the paper we discuss selected important facts related to the subjective image quality evaluation and we present some anomalous experimental behavior of image compression techniques. An object-defined approach is investigated and advantageous characteristics of chosen methods are deployed to achieve the optimal performance of the surveillance video coder. Among others, we propose to use the artificial neural network (ANN) to predict resulting image quality rating scores. The proposed quality assessment model has been trained and tested using a set of grayscale images distorted by selected image compression algorithms", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "22", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "Jan. 2007", "inspec": "9290504", "date": "Jan. 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Mar 12 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "22 - 25", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Milos Klima", "Petr Pata", "Karel Fliegel", "Pavel Hanzlik"], "keywords": ["data compression", "image segmentation", "neural nets", "video coding", "video surveillance", "artificial neural network", "grayscale images", "image compression", "image information", "image quality evaluation", "object-defined approach", "security imaging systems", "surveillance video coder", "video information", "Artificial neural networks", "Data security", "Face recognition", "Image coding", "Image quality", "Image segmentation", "Information security", "Surveillance", "Testing", "Video compression", ""], "arnumber": "4126416"}
