This application note is one such example of a VXI solution for a worldwide leader in commercial property and risk management that operates a destructive test facility to analyze the results of disasters predominantly caused by fire. The company implemented a re-configurable 2,400 channel test system based on Kinetic Systems' VXI modules that used a fiber optic ring to synchronize multiple chassis and multiple channels. Technical details of the VXI implementation and results will be discussed", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "14", "date_publication": "Jan. 2007", "inspec": "9290502", "date": "Jan. 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Mar 12 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "1", "pages": "11 - 14", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Nicole Faubert", "Louis Kelm", "Steven C.
