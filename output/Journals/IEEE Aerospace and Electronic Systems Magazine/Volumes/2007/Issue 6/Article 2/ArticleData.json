A brief overview of the FOQA concept is given along with a historical perspective to the evolution of such programs. Initial development of a FOQA program for general aviation by the Center for Sensors and Sensor Systems at Saint Louis University is introduced herein. A brief discussion of the obstacles in developing such a system is presented, as well as strategies for overcoming these obstacles. The system consists mainly of a quick access recorder (QAR) that is conceived to be a stand-alone, non-intrusive system that collects parametric flight data, a preprocessor system to analyze initial data sets and validate their use, and post-processor software used in the analysis of available flight parameters. The program concepts are presented for initial determination of the needs and possibilities, and examples are presented along with flight data collected in the University's fleet of aircraft.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "15", "date_publication": "June 2007", "inspec": "9616533", "date": "June 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 16 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "9 - 15", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Kyle Mitchell", "Beshara Sholy", "Alan J.
