One of the more intriguing possibilities is mobility in very irregular and otherwise impassable terrain. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center is developing the third generation of its addressable reconfigurable technology (ART) tetrahedral robotics architecture. An ART-based variable geometry truss consisting of 12 tetrahedral elements made from 26 smart struts on a wireless network has been developed. The primary goal of this development is the demonstration of a new kind of robotic mobility that can provide access and articulation that complement existing capabilities. An initial set of gaits and other behaviors are being tested, and accommodations for payloads such as sensor and telemetry packages are being studied. Herein, we describe our experience with the ART tetrahedral robotics architecture and the improvements implemented in the third generation of this technology. Applications of these robots to space exploration and the tradeoffs involved with this architecture will be discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "22", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "June 2007", "inspec": "9616534", "date": "June 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 16 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "6", "pages": "22 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Steven Curtis", "Matthew Brandt", "Greg Bowers", "Gary Brown", "Cynthia Cheung", "Caner Cooperider", "Mike Desch", "Noah Desch", "John Dorband", "Kyle Gregory", "Ken Lee", "Allan Lunsford", "Fred Minetto", "Walt Truszkowski", "Richard Wesenberg", "John Vranish", "Tom Capon", "Michael Weaker", "Tom Capon", "Michael Weaker", "Richard Watson", "Philip Olivier", "Michael L.
