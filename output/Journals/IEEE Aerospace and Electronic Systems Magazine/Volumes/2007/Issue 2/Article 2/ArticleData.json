Mixtures of an organic dye and green phosphor created bright afterglow emission in the spectral region from yellow to red, which was difficult to attain with conventional red phosphors. Rhodamine and kiton were suitable for converting green phosphorescence to orange or red fluorescence. The resins continued to glow in darkness for longer than 3 hours after an excitation lamp was turned off. This long afterglow characteristic of the current dye phosphor mixtures was in remarkable contrast with the fast phosphorescence decay of the conventional red phosphors (10-20 mm). These red afterglow resins improve visibility of emergency signs, and realize warm-colored illumination that provides a sense of security in darkness", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "13", "date_publication": "Feb. 2007", "inspec": "9323927", "date": "Feb. 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Mar 05 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "9 - 13", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Mitsunori Saito", "Hiroyasu Kondo"], "keywords": ["afterglows", "dyes", "emergency lighting", "phosphorescence", "phosphors", "resins", "RGB phosphorescence", "RGB phosphors", "acrylic resins", "afterglow emission", "afterglow resins", "battery-independent emergency illumination", "dye phosphor mixtures", "fluorescence", "kiton", "organic dye", "phosphorescence decay", "rhodamine", "warm-colored illumination", "Earthquakes", "Explosions", "Fires", "Fluorescence", "Instruments", "Lighting", "Phosphorescence", "Phosphors", "Resins", "Security", ""], "arnumber": "4118051"}
