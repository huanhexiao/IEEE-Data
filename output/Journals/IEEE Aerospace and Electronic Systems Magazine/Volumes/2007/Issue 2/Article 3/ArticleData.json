It shows how a full service chain for traffic information services could be established and gave an overview of the widely used method traffic message channel (TMC). After a discussion about the growing requirements of telematics systems, a new approach to location referencing is presented: the on-the-fly methods. The difficulties regarding the development of on-the-fly methods was discussed and present the AGORA-C method which is currently in the standardisation process. An overview of the publicised test results using the AGORA-C method concerning its reliability and applicability was given. In addition, another algorithm for location referencing, MEI-LIN, was presented which focuses on a better identification of a location using topological information of the surrounding road network. An outlook on the current research in Europe shows the main future tasks of establishing location referencing methods", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "21", "date_publication": "Feb. 2007", "inspec": "9323928", "date": "Feb. 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Mar 05 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "14 - 21", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
