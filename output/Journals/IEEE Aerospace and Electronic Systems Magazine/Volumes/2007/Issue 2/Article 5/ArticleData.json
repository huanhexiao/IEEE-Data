These schemes use a central coordinator to either: 1) micromanage rovers one activity at a time; 2) assign mission goals to rovers; or 3) arbitrate mission goal auctions among rovers. A self-commanding collection of rovers would autonomously coordinate itself to satisfy high-level science and engineering goals in a changing partially understood environment - making the operation of tens or even a hundred spacecraft feasible", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "33", "date_publication": "Feb. 2007", "inspec": "9323930", "date": "Feb. 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Mar 05 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "2", "pages": "27 - 33", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Anthony Barrett", "Gregg Rabideau", "Tara Estlin", "Steve Chien"], "keywords": ["command and control systems", "planetary rovers", "planning", "space vehicles", "arbitrate mission goal auctions", "collective mission goals", "command sequences", "control collections", "cooperating rovers", "coordinated continual planning", "self-commanding collection", "spacecraft", "Aerospace engineering", "Bandwidth", "Control systems", "Event detection", "NASA", "Propulsion", "Satellites", "Space missions", "Space vehicles", "Vibration measurement", ""], "arnumber": "4118054"}
