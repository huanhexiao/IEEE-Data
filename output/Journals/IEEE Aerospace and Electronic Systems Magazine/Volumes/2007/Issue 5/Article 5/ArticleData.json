In order to provide a complete INS solution (i.e., attitude, velocity, position, and biases), an extended Kalman filter algorithm is developed and implemented in real-time. A devised control strategy utilizes multiple PID loops with a hierarchy enabling simple attitude stabilization to full waypoint navigation. The developed ground station unit, a laptop computer, communicates with the avionics package via 802.11b WiFi, displays the aircraft critical information, provides in-flight PID gain tunings, and uploads waypoints through a simple GUI. The system is installed in an off-the-shelf delta-wing R/C aircraft and demonstrates its performance for aerial robotic applications", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "30", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "34", "date_publication": "May 2007", "inspec": "9478729", "date": "May 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "30 - 34", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Jung Soon Jang", "Darren Liccardo"], "keywords": ["Kalman filters", "aerospace robotics", "attitude control", "avionics", "graphical user interfaces", "inertial navigation", "micromechanical devices", "position control", "remotely operated vehicles", "three-term control", "velocity control", "wireless LAN", "802.11b WiFi", "GUI", "Kalman filter algorithm", "MEMS", "MNAV", "PID gain tunings", "Stargate", "UAV automation", "aerial robotic", "attitude stabilization", "avionics package", "delta-wing RC aircraft", "embedded computing", "ground station", "inertial navigation system", "laptop computer", "sensor suite", "unmanned aerial vehicle", "Aerospace electronics", "Aircraft navigation", "Computer displays", "Costs", "Embedded computing", "Micromechanical devices", "Packaging", "Robot sensing systems", "Robotics and automation", "Unmanned aerial vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "4215066"}
