Operational availability enhancements via comprehensive supportability programs combined with keen attentiveness to reliability and maintainability metrics are driving the avionics fiber optic BIT value proposition. Avionics fiber optic BIT technology is expected to reduce failure rate and mean time to repair by predicting link failure before link failure actually occurs, running post-maintenance stress screening upon aircraft start-up, improving fault isolation by reducing the troubleshooting ambiguity zone from three to one, and reducing the need for separate support equipment for system troubleshooting", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "20", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "May 2007", "inspec": "9468196", "date": "May 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "20 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Mark W.
