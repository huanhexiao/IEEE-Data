Boeing has been working with the FAA since 2004 to define the role of SWIM within the framework of the existing and envisioned set of national airspace system (NAS) communications systems and air traffic operations. SWIM, as an information management infrastructure, in effect creates a \"system of systems\" of existing (and new) systems (or software applications, or simply applications) interacting through SWIM services. Describing SWIM in such a context is only fruitful when adopting the point of view of each person based on their role and perspective of airspace operations, be they a user, an application developed, or a SWIM implemented. This paper describes the current vision of SWIM from multiple viewpoints (operational, functional, physical) in an attempt to provide a broad perspective of SWIM to a technical audience of mixed backgrounds", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "19", "date_publication": "May 2007", "inspec": "9468195", "date": "May 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "5", "pages": "13 - 19", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Jere S.
