Additionally, the social and legal acceptance of the written signature for authentication purposes is opening a range of new applications. We describe a highly versatile and scalable prototype for Web-based secure access using signature verification. The proposed architecture can be easily extended to work with different kinds of sensors and large-scale databases. Several remarks are also given on security and privacy of network-based signature verification", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "April 2007", "inspec": "9423637", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 23 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "3 - 8", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Fernando Alonso-Fernandez", "Julian Fierrez-Aguilar", "Javier Ortega-Garcia", "Joaquin Gonzalez-Rodriguez"], "keywords": ["Internet", "data privacy", "digital signatures", "file servers", "portable computers", "telecommunication security", "Web-based secure access", "authentication", "large-scale databases", "low-cost portable devices", "network-based signature verification", "secure access system", "sensors", "signature signals", "tablet PC", "Authentication", "Biometrics", "Data security", "Handwriting recognition", "Law", "Legal factors", "Network servers", "Personal communication networks", "Prototypes", "Web server", ""], "arnumber": "4161179"}
