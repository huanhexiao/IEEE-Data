The International Standards Organization (e.g., ISO 9001) and the Software Engineering Institute capability maturity model provide good foundations upon which to improve software development processes and quality. These standards are not often used to develop safety-critical software although some organizations have successfully used SEI-CMM to develop mission critical software. Organizations who sponsor or develop guidance for development of safety-critical software include the US DoD, the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the Motor Industry Software Reliability Association (MISRA), and RTCA, Inc., (formerly the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics)", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "April 2007", "inspec": "9423640", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 23 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "18 - 22", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Joseph Wiad"], "keywords": ["safety systems", "software reusability", "Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers", "International Electrotechnical Commission", "International Standards Organization", "Motor Industry Software Reliability Association", "RTCA, Inc.", "Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics", "Software Engineering Institute", "US DoD", "United Kingdom Ministry of Defence", "maturity model", "safety-critical primer", "software developers", "software reuse", "Capability maturity model", "IEC", "ISO standards", "Programming", "Software engineering", "Software quality", "Software safety", "Software standards", "Standards development", "Standards organizations", ""], "arnumber": "4161182"}
