Like manned aircraft, avoiding collisions with transponder-equipped, or \"cooperative\" traffic is among the primary hazards. This paper discusses the necessity of developing various models of environmental and system components in the collision avoidance functional chain. Potential sensitivities and shortcomings of the TCAS collision avoidance system for unmanned aircraft are discussed. The analysis method of fast-time simulation can develop a rich sample of collision encounter events from the numerous statistical distributions. This provides an established means to demonstrate system compliance with safety targets, when they are established", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "13", "date_publication": "April 2007", "inspec": "9423638", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 23 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "9 - 13", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Andrew D.
