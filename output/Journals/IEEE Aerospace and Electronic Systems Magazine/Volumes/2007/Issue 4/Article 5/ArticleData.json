Results of onboard control complex accuracy characteristics estimation are presented at the given dynamic spacecraft scheme which is taking into account the liquid oscillations in tanks and structure elements elasticity. At modelling the errors of measuring devices installation, errors of SINS initial alignment and instrumental errors of SINS sensitive elements, variation of control engines parameters were taken into account. The structure of the developed complex of imitation modelling of interplanetary spacecraft controlled motion is resulted. Estimations of active flight legs realization accuracy were received by a method of statistical modelling of spacecraft controlled motion", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "April 2007", "inspec": "9423641", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 23 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "23 - 29", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["V.
