Often the land surrounding a high consequence facility is remote and difficult to sensor with conventional long-range detection systems. In order to combat this difficult problem, Sandia has investigated, developed, and fielded a wireless sensor network that demonstrated the value of providing advanced information of adversary activities. The project used wireless technologies to detect and assess intruders in remote \"un-engineered\" terrain around a fixed facility. In the time since the wireless intrusion detection system was fielded, minimal time has been spent on maintenance and no batteries required replacement. Sandia's wireless sensor network provides advanced warning of intruder activities and its installation will improve the security posture of a facility", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "30", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "33", "date_publication": "April 2007", "inspec": "9423642", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 23 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "30 - 33", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Bradley C.
