It provides a needed increase in voice channel capacity as well as offering a digital data link for CPDLC with the high integrity and low latency needed for time-critical ATC messages. This report summarizes results of measurements of proposed minimum requirements for an aeronautical receiver for VDL Mode E. A software defined radio (SDR) currently used in commercial air transport communications was used for the tests", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "34", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "38", "date_publication": "April 2007", "inspec": "9423643", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 23 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "4", "pages": "34 - 38", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Fred Studenberg"], "keywords": ["aircraft communication", "amplitude modulation", "digital radio", "radio receivers", "software radio", "VDL mode E receiver", "VHF aeronautical communications", "analog AM voice system", "commercial air transport communications", "digital communications", "software defined radio", "voice channel capacity", "Channel capacity", "Communication standards", "Current measurement", "Delay", "Digital communication", "Receivers", "Software measurement", "Software radio", "Software testing", "Time factors", ""], "arnumber": "4161185"}
