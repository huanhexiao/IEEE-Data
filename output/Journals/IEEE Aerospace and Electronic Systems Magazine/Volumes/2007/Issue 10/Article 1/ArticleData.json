This results in an increasingly complex system, where applications are tightly coupled and expensive to develop and maintain. System-Wide Information Management (SWIM) addresses these shortfalls by implementing a shared infrastructure for managing NAS information. SWIM is based on a service-oriented architecture, a fast growing trend in information technology. It will help the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) meet the information-sharing needs of the Next Generation Air Traffic System (NGATS) and the federal government's E-government Initiative. SWIM will reduce the cost, complexity, and cycle time for building new applications and help the FAA implement SWIM-enabled applications that increase FAA and user productivity.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "Oct. 2007", "inspec": "9680268", "date": "Oct. 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 05 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "10", "pages": "3 - 12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Steven Glickman"], "keywords": ["information management", "software architecture", "travel industry", "user interfaces", "E-government initiative", "Federal Aviation Administration", "National Airspace System", "Next Generation Air Traffic System", "application-to-application interface", "business case", "information sharing", "service-oriented architecture", "shared infrastructure", "system-wide information management", "Air traffic control", "Control systems", "Costs", "FAA", "Imaging phantoms", "Information management", "Information technology", "Service oriented architecture", "Testing", "US Government", ""], "arnumber": "4376105"}
