While removing the clutter background, however, such methods may reverse the relative energy distribution of target and noise in the clutter suppressed image, and disturb the subsequent target segmentation and detection. This paper analyzes the causation of such problems, does research on the relationship between target energy characteristics and detection probability, and presents a novel filter of energy distribution adaptive rectification (EDARF). Based on the EDARF, an improved framework of dim small target detection is proposed to rectify the energy distribution in the clutter-suppressed images by conventional adaptive filters. The proposed EDARF's performance is estimated by experimental comparisons of three linear/nonlinear filters before and after using EDARF. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed EDARF improves efficiently the performance of detecting dim small targets against strong undulant cloud-cluttered backgrounds.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "20", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "Aug. 2007", "inspec": "9618548", "date": "Aug. 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "8", "pages": "20 - 26", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Biyin Zhang", "Tianxu Zhang", "Kun Zhang", "Zhao Ch", "Zhiguo Cao"], "keywords": ["adaptive filters", "clutter", "infrared imaging", "optical tracking", "target tracking", "IR targets detection", "adaptive rectification filter", "clutter suppression", "detection probability", "energy distribution adaptive rectification", "nonlinear filters", "relative energy distribution", "small target detection", "target energy characteristics", "Adaptive filters", "Background noise", "Bayesian methods", "Filtering", "Image segmentation", "Infrared detectors", "Nonlinear filters", "Object detection", "Performance analysis", "Sea surface", ""], "arnumber": "4301021"}
