A project to build DAB based radar is described, together with its advantages and disadvantages. Several serious obstacles need to be overcome in order to make the system a reality. Most importantly, these include the removal of direct signal interference and the extraction of the illuminating signal in a form suitable for detections. Progress toward the solution of these problems will be described. In addition, some real aircraft detections are included to prove the viability of a practical system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Nov. 2007", "inspec": "9732567", "date": "Nov. 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "11", "pages": "13 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Heath J.
