The goal of the workshop was to identify recent international activities in the unmanned airborne systems (UAS) airspace integration problem. The workshop attracted a broad cross-section of the UAS community, including: airspace and safety regulators, developers, operators, and researchers. The three themes of discussion were: progress in the development of standards and regulations; lessons learnt from recent operations; and advances in new technologies. This summarises the activities of the workshop and explores the important outcomes and trends as perceived by these authors.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "29", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "44", "date_publication": "Nov. 2007", "inspec": "9667947", "date": "Nov. 2007", "date_current_version": "Wed Dec 26 00:00:00 EST 2007", "issue": "11", "pages": "29 - 44", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["Lennon Cork", "Reece Clothier", "Luis F.
