The quick-release small-sized complex makes registration of the information of onboard systems, definition of trajectory parameters of FV, the information synchronization of onboard systems, and trajectory parameters. OTMC is used for the solution of the whole set of different tasks on estimation of the characteristics of FV and its onboard equipment. With the help OTMC in flight tests there solved the tasks of estimation: operation and accuracy characteristics of air navigation computing systems, inertial navigational systems, integrated navigational systems; SNS receivers, landing radio engineering systems, accuracy of flights under the standard takeoff patterns and landing, take-off and landing characteristics, accuracy characteristics of radars, corrections of high-altitude, fast-track parameters, systems of early warning of ground proximity etc", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "26", "volume": "22", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "March 2007", "inspec": "9380104", "date": "March 2007", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 02 00:00:00 EDT 2007", "issue": "3", "pages": "26 - 29", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["E.
