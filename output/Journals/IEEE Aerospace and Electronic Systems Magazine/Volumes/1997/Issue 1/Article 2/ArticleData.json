This radar system has demonstrated over-the-horizon detection of targets such as vessels, ice hazards and low-flying aircraft, and performed ocean parameter measurements over a large area. The industrial developers of offshore hydrocarbon reserves in ice infested regions have an urgent requirement for the long range detection and tracking of icebergs from their production platforms. However, due to space restrictions, a rig- or ship-based system can only accommodate a compact antenna array. The uniform trajectory and low velocity of icebergs is ideal for Reciprocal Synthetic Aperture Radar (RSAR) processing with long target dwell times. The proven ice detection capability of HF-GWR systems, coupled with the compact antennas suggested by the RSAR technique, can be used to develop a rig- or ship-based all-weather surveillance device for ice hazards. It is also anticipated that the results of this research will allow the use of shorter antenna arrays for many other applications. Preliminary results using real data from the operational HF-GWR system are presented", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "40", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "43", "date_publication": "Jan 1997", "inspec": "5505097", "date": "Jan 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "40 - 43", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
