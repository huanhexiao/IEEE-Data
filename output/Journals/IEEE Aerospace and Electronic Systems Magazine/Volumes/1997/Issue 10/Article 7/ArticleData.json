In some cases, one engineer would write the FTR/TRD and another would develop the TPS. Commercial ATLAS FTRs are prepared in ARINC 616 and 626 ATLAS. Military TRDs are written in IEEE ATLAS 716 versions. Previous test reuse attempts have not been successful because additional software, like browsers, is required to support these efforts. It was difficult to justify writing new software; for example, browsers to manage the application software. Today, commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) tools are in place to browse and view information from circuit diagrams to documents to source code. These tools can develop hierarchies to organize the information. These COTS tools are available throughout Boeing on many types of workstations and personal computers on every engineer's desk. This paper discusses how a reusable test library (RTL) is being developed using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) tools, such as Mosaic, to address commercial and military test applications. It describes each of the tools and the process to develop TPSs using the reuse library. It defines the metrics and benefits achieved", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "12", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Oct 1997", "inspec": "5727598", "date": "Oct 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "12 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["E.
