The aim of the model is to support the development of design tools for satellite systems adopting active phased arrays. The achieved results are rendered parametric with respect to a key system requirement, the effective isotropic radiated power, due to its direct impact on transmitter configuration and technological features as well as on the critical compromise between transmitter and antenna specifications", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "Oct 1997", "inspec": "5720446", "date": "Oct 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "23 - 29", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
