This study presents data on a 100% depth of discharge (DOD) life test performed on a nominal capacity 42-Ah battery. The purpose of this study is to validate design concepts, determine the life characteristics of the newly designed sealed Ni-Cd batteries, and develop baseline information on failure rates and mechanisms. The data from this experiment can be used to compare depth of discharge versus battery life with similar tests such as the lower DOD experiments performed on spacecraft batteries. This information is important in the ongoing development of long life batteries and in developing failure models for life prediction", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "Oct 1997", "inspec": "5720445", "date": "Oct 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "17 - 22", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["T.
