The traditional solution to this problem implies having an autonomous power plant on board each spacecraft. The most widely used are power plants with solar cells. However, there exists an alternative power supply concept of using a centralized power supply system (CPSS) and power transmission to the user satellites by laser or microwave beams. Use of a CPSS has a number of advantages. In particular, it allows the spacecraft to increase power supply level and service life as well as to decrease the spacecraft mass and cost. However, it sets new physical and technical problems associated with long distance power transmission and requires some changes in spacecraft structure and concepts. The feasibility study of CPSS development and use has to rely on existing or firmly forecastable technologies. An attempt of such an analysis has been done by a group of scientists at Moscow State Aviation Institute during 1994-1996. The very first results have already been published. This paper discusses new results obtained lately regarding a space based CPSS", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "7", "date_publication": "Oct 1997", "inspec": "5720443", "date": "Oct 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "3 - 7", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
