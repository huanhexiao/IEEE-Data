The operational conditions of this satellite imposed challenging requirements for the on-board Electrical Power System (EPS), Going through various phases of its development and on-orbit performance verifications, there were certain events and/or circumstances we would have liked to avoid. Some circumstances were avoided with preventative measures, other potentially detrimental events were not. Thus, a number of valuable lessons were learned which are presented in this paper", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "Jun 1997", "inspec": "5619144", "date": "Jun 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "18 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
