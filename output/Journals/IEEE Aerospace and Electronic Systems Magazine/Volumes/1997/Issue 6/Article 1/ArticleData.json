Development cells have demonstrated the ability to deliver over 60 Watt-hours per kilogram at the one hour rate. Cycle life has been improved to more than 600 cycles at 80% depth of discharge by using a patented, reduced solubility zinc electrode and an improved sealed cell design. More than 8000 charge/discharge cycles at 10% depth-of-discharge have been completed. Large quantities of sealed prismatic cells have been manufactured, including a 140 cell, 220 V battery for a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV)", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "35", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "38", "date_publication": "Jun 1997", "inspec": "5612143", "date": "Jun 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "35 - 38", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
