Test Programs are usually written by specifying the instruments to be used in the ATE and the sequence of the setup and measurement parameters for these instruments. Reuse of test program software on other ATE is usually not possible without rewriting, revalidating and re-releasing the programs. This paper describes an implementation of a test program software development system and a standard of software runtime architecture used in our factories. The object-oriented development environment and its associated class libraries allow test programs to be written without knowledge of the ATE on which they will be run. Two main principles guided the design: the software architecture was based on recognized formal and industry standards; and our implementation used commercial off-the-shelf software products when possible. Emerging standards such as the IEEE-1226 (ABBET) as well as defacto industry standards including VXI Plug and Play have made our implementation possible. The current draft of the ABBET and P&P standards do not promote this instrument independence, but it is hoped that this will be added as the standards mature. Three immediate benefits are: cost savings that result from reusing validated test programs; cycle time reductions that result from concurrently developing test program software and ATE; and software defect reductions that result from using proven software", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "29", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "34", "date_publication": "Jun 1997", "inspec": "5612142", "date": "Jun 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "29 - 34", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["B.
