Self-testing sensors, smart sensors, and intelligent alarm analyzers are all designed to provide useful information to the operator. However, today's current annunciator systems were not designed to accommodate these new technologies. New display technologies are also changing the look and feel of the annunciator of the future. Annunciator technology needs to \u201ccatch up\u201d to these other security technologies. This paper presents the concept for a new, object-oriented approach to annunciator architecture design. The new architecture could accommodate simple, switch-closure devices as well as information-rich sensors and intelligent analyzers. In addition the architecture could allow other leading-edge interfaces to be easily integrated into the annunciator system. These technologies will reduce operator workload and aid the operator in making informed security decisions", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "Jun 1997", "inspec": "5612141", "date": "Jun 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "25 - 28", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
