This paper presents two antenna array configurations that use simpler feed, simpler phase-shifting and simpler beam-steering control circuitry for realizing low-cost phased arrays. Both are lens configurations. The first one uses a Radant lens, which provides a medium that is loaded with diodes and provides the needed phase shift by switching the diodes on and off. The other configuration employs a ferroelectric dielectric material whose dielectric constant can be varied with an applied DC bias voltage. It is shown that the ferroelectric lens may have further advantages of smaller thickness, simpler beam-steering controls and lower cost", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "39", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "44", "date_publication": "Jun 1997", "inspec": "5612144", "date": "Jun 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "39 - 44", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
