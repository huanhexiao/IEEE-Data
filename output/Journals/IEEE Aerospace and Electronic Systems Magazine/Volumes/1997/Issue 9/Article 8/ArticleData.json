These will be caused by the greater volume of more complex software, by the increased number of untested software states, and by more incidents of hardware/software interaction faults as a result of increased hardware speed and density. The traditional software implemented fault tolerance: approaches have been successfully utilized in life-critical systems, such as digital flight controls, where their additional costs can be easily justified. Examples include N-Version Programming and Recovery Block approaches. However, there is still a need for dependable computing for mission-critical applications as well. Often, these traditional techniques are avoided for mission-critical systems due to the difficulty in justifying their extra up-front development cost. We provide an alternative for the high \u201csunk cost\u201d of traditional software fault tolerance techniques. The methodology, called data fusion integrity processes (DFIPs), is a simple, yet effective technique for mission-critical systems. In addition, the approach establishes a framework from which other costlier, more extensive traditional techniques can be added. We present details of the DFIP methodology and a DFIP framework for Ada programs. We also briefly discuss development of a DFIP code generation system which exploits Java that will enable users to quickly build a DFIP framework in Ada, and select reusable DFIP component methods", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "Sep 1997", "inspec": "5701188", "date": "Sep 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "25 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
