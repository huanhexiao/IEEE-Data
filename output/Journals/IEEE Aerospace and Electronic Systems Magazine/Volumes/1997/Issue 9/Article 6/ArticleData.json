This paper discusses the sensor fusion approach taken to perform intelligent alarm analysis for the Advanced Exterior Sensor (AES). The AES is an intrusion detection and assessment system designed for wide-area coverage, quick deployment, low false/nuisance alarm operation, and immediate visual assessment. It combines three sensor technologies (visible, infrared, and millimeter wave radar) collocated on a compact and portable remote sensor module. The remote sensor module rotates at a rate of 1 revolution per second to detect and track motion and provide assessment in a continuous 360\u00b0 field-of-regard. Sensor fusion techniques are used to correlate and integrate the track data from these three sensors into a single track for operator observation. Additional inputs to the fusion process include environmental data, knowledge of sensor performance under certain weather conditions, sensor priority, and recent operator feedback. A confidence value is assigned to the track as a result of the fusion process. This helps to reduce nuisance alarms and to increase operator confidence in the system while reducing the workload of the operator", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "Sep 1997", "inspec": "5701187", "date": "Sep 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "18 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
