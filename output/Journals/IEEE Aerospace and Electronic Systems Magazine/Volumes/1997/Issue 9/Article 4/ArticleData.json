Much of the literature is swayed by the use of each environment by a single application. This paper will provide detailed information on ARGO Systems evaluation of three popular ATE Test Environments: the Ada Based Environment for Testing (ABET), the TYX PAWS ATLAS test environment and the National Instruments LabVIEW graphical test environment. This evaluation was accomplished by comparing the same test program measurements in each environment using the same UUT, interface test adapter, and the same PC-based ATE. As such, the data represents a true apples-to-apples comparison of these environments", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "12", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "17", "date_publication": "Sep 1997", "inspec": "5701186", "date": "Sep 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "12 - 17", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
