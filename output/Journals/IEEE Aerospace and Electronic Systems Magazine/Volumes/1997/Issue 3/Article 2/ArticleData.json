As advanced technologies are integrated into transportation systems, the transit system becomes more efficient and reliable, which, in turn, makes it more attractive to users. The greatest benefit will not be realized until all of these technologies are integrated. Transit agencies and system integrators who take a total systems approach to the integration of advanced technologies will have a competitive advantage. They will provide services which provide the greatest utility to prospective users, riders, and the transit agency at the lowest cost", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "Mar 1997", "inspec": "5530359", "date": "Mar 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "18 - 22", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["K.
