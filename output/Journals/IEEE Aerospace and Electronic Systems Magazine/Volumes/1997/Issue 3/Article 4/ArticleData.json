Taking into account the opening of new airports and expansion of existing ones, such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Shangai and Kimpo, it is estimated that the North Pacific traffic volumes will be 1.7 times greater by the year 2000 compared to that of 1992, and 2.9 times greater by the year 2010. In dealing with such traffic in that region use of the new Communications Navigation Surveillance Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) through Multi-Function Transport Satellite (MTSAT) system is indispensable", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "33", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "37", "date_publication": "Mar 1997", "inspec": "5530362", "date": "Mar 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "33 - 37", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["S.
