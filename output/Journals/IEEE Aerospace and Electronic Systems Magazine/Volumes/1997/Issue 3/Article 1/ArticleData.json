The case study in question involves the specification of an asynchronous message router; the three design tools are process algebra (specifically Milner's Calculus of Communicating Systems CCS), the modal \u03bc-calculus and the Edinburgh Concurrency Workbench (CWB). We demonstrate how an informally-presented specification can be formalised within the language of the modal \u03bc-calculus, allowing for a rigorous mathematical analysis of the correctness of our proposed implementation. For modest-sized versions of the router, this correctness proof has been carried out using the CWB.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "38", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "44", "date_publication": "March 1997", "inspec": "5530363", "date": "March 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "38 - 44", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["F.
