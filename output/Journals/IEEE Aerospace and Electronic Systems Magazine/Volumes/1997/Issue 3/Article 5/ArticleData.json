Not only do adjacent structures and very common multiple antennas disturb the characteristics, but also in the case of an ideal position does the vertical lobing introduce errors exceeding 10 dB. The problems are likely to be worse in dense urban areas, where multipath from surrounding buildings is the dominating propagation mode", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "11", "date_publication": "Mar 1997", "inspec": "5530358", "date": "Mar 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "9 - 11", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
