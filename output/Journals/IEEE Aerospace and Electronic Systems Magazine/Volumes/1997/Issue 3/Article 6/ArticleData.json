A tool for quantitative measurement of fixed CCTV surveillance systems", "abstract": "A range of specified measurements is now being regularly used as part of the specification and commissioning requirements for CCTV systems, As a result of this increased activity during commissioning it has been noted that the time and effort required is extensive. Also there are still a number of subjective observations which must be made, To build on this work it is proposed to develop an automated measurement system which will utilise measured video signal parameters as a means of defining system performance", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "29", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "32", "date_publication": "Mar 1997", "inspec": "5530361", "date": "Mar 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "29 - 32", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
