A world that, ten years ago, was unaware of the concept can now witness approximately 200 fuel cell units operating in 15 countries. Energy planners and decision makers are becoming aware that, in addition to a continual increase in installations, the reliability of early commercial units is outstanding and the cost is dropping. They have begun to ask whether fuel cells might fit into their future. While the fuel cell concept is simple, determining which type of fuel cell to consider may prove taxing. The multiplicity of fuel cells and their development programs, coupled with the amount of subject material and claims-versus-reality, may seem overwhelming. Fuel cell commercialization activities in North America are the focus of five manufacturers that are developing four types [fuel cells are typed by electrolyte: the 200\u00b0C phosphoric acid (PAFC); the 80\u00b0C proton exchange membrane (PEM); the 650\u00b0C molten carbonate (MCFC); and the 1,000\u00b0C solid oxide (SOFC) fuel cells]. Each fuel cell promises the attractive combination of fairly high efficiency and superior environmental performance compared to the presently available fossil-fueled electric generation technologies. As a result, fuel cells are particularly easy to site. There are additional advantages such as: excellent availability; electrical VAR control; quick ramp rate; remote/unattended operation; and redundancy when multiple units are installed. After earlier success in space, fuel cells are being applied to the commercial sector as on-site cogeneration units mostly fueled by natural gas. They are being considered for larger distributed generators (natural gas) and for vehicular power plants (methanol)", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "Mar 1997", "inspec": "5530360", "date": "Mar 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "23 - 28", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
