Previous concentration was on the reduction of the number of splices and component improvements in the open-loop minimum configuration. Now non-essential components and splices are eliminated. The source-detector coupler is not part of the Sagnac interferometer, and serves solely to direct light from the interferometer into the output photodetector. Many commercial laser diodes incorporate a back-facet photodetector to monitor laser intensity. The signal returned from the Sagnac traverses the laser, and can be detected at this photodetector. The gyro signal can be distinguished from the laser signal by the bias modulation applied in the interferometer. Configuring a gyro in this manner eliminates a directional coupler and the separate photodetector, as well as up to two fiber splices in an all-fiber gyroscope. A production, open-loop fiber optic gyroscope has been modified to demonstrate this principle. The gyroscope exhibits performance comparable to the conventional minimum configuration", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "21", "date_publication": "Apr 1997", "inspec": "5569949", "date": "Apr 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "4", "pages": "18 - 21", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["S.
