LCPOS was designed to be a cost-effective alternative to a high performance costly ship INS (SINS). The demonstrated accuracy of the LCPOS integrated navigation solution is comparable to that of the SINS", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "19", "date_publication": "May 1997", "inspec": "5594092", "date": "May 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "15 - 19", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["B.
