These major issues are presented, discussed, and suggestions for resolving them are offered. The issue of beam safety can be captured in the phrase \u201cFear of Frying.\u201d Can a properly engineered beamed power safety system allay the public perception of microwave radiation dangers? Openness, visibility, and education may be keys to resolving this issue satisfactorily. \u201cNot in my Spectrum\u201d is a phrase that is frequently encountered in connection with the issue of where can the microwave power beam frequency be located. International cooperation may provide a part of the solution to this issue. \u201cWow, that much!\u201d is a phrase encountered when dealing with the issue of economic affordability of large beamed power systems. A phased engineering approach for multiple uses even during construction is presented to aid in garnering revenue during the system build phase. Also, dual mode DC-RF converters are encouraged for bi-directional power flow utility and economies of scale in production", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "10", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "14", "date_publication": "May 1997", "inspec": "5594091", "date": "May 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "10 - 14", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
