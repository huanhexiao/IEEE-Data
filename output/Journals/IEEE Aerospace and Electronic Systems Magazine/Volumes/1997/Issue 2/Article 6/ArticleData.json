One is the high cost of the INS, and the other is the cost and complexity of tightly-coupled OPS/INS integration. One of those two barriers has recently been diminished drastically with the development of a standardized software package for tightly-coupled integration. In the past, only the largest corporations have been able to pay the initial development cost for tightly-coupled OPS/INS integration, usually with funding from a large defense program. Using the new software package, integration and van test can be accomplished in a matter of days, and this has been demonstrated with field trials. The package is intended primarily for small companies that otherwise would not be able to build tightly-coupled OPS/INS systems at all. What would have been a prohibitive 3- or 4-man year development effort is reduced to a few man weeks. To accomplish an integration, the system integrator has to find a way, through serial interfaces or by some other means, to get the INS measurements of acceleration (accumulated velocity change \u0394V) and attitude rate (accumulated angle change \u0394\u03b8) into a processor, along with the raw data of a GPS receiver. He also has to find a way to time tag the INS \u0394V, \u0394\u03b8 with GPS time. The rest of tightly-coupled OPS/INS integration is predominately accomplished in the standardized software package. That leaves the cost of the INS as the only remaining barrier to the very widespread use of OPS/INS, and invites new development of low cost inertial sensors. The focus of this paper is on the software package, and how it achieves standardization and ease of use while retaining the flexibility to produce optimal results with a variety of INS and GPS receiver types", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "Feb 1997", "inspec": "5505099", "date": "Feb 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "14 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
