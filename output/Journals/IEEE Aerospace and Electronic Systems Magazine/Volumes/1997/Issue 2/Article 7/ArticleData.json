In this paper, it has been demonstrated that the radiation continuum model (RCM) of light results in a modification to Newton's static gravitational potential. Applying this modified potential to the case of Mercury's anomalous perihelion advance accounts for the entire 43\" per century, and provides a form equivalent to that of GRT. Thus, this model will work equally well for any system to which it is applied, all without resorting to the space-time curvature of GRT. The same potential, applied to the problem of a solar grazing photon, gives a solution identical in form and content to that of GRT as well. Such results lead to the conclusion that these effects are not attributable to massive objects curving space-time", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "7", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "11", "date_publication": "Feb 1997", "inspec": "5505098", "date": "Feb 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "7 - 11", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
