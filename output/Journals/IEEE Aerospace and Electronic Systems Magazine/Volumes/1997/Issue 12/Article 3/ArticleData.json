The RSS uses detailed sensor models, along with digital topographic, land cover and cultural databases, to provide accurate performance predictions. The RSS is currently being used by the FAA to assist in their sensor deployments and analyses", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "Dec 1997", "inspec": "5811691", "date": "Dec 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "12", "pages": "19 - 26", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["B.
