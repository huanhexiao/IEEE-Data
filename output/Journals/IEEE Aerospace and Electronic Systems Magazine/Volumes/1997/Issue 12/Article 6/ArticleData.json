Recovery from transients is imperative to maintain necessary system reliability in the face of transient errors which have been estimated to occur at a rate of 5 to 100 times that of permanent failures. Excessive delays associated with recovery become a problem when as much as 1 Mbytes of RAM in the faulty processor must be made congruent with the processing majority while maintaining full functionality of critical, real-time control algorithms. This paper describes a hardware assisted recovery technique which uses memory \u201ctags\u201d to determine which memory segments need to be restored such that recovery can be performed incrementally without affecting real-time operational tasks. Also presented is performance data associated with this technique's application to a Draper Laboratory quad-redundant processor responsible for vehicle control of a manned undersea vehicle", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "17", "date_publication": "Dec 1997", "inspec": "5811690", "date": "Dec 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "12", "pages": "13 - 17", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["T.
