In addition, the VRLA batteries offer the user a no-maintenance battery and other enhanced features that make this a very desirable battery for aircraft applications. In field trials, where VRLA batteries were substituted for nickel-cadmium batteries, the VRLA provided the user with a high reliability turbine engine starting battery under a wide variety of climatic conditions", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "35", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "38", "date_publication": "Jul 1997", "inspec": "5641020", "date": "Jul 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "35 - 38", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
