The Soldier ID system includes an Interrogation Unit with a programmable activation code. The Interrogation Unit consists of a directive, eye-safe laser and a spread-spectrum RF transceiver. This allows for a low probability of intercept (LPI) interrogation, which is of interest during covert operations. A Responder Unit is worn, for example, by a soldier and transmits an LPI spread-spectrum RF response, only after receiving the proper interrogation codes. The basic subsystems for the identification system are a Laser Interrogation Unit, an RF Responder Unit, and an electronic Programming Unit. The operating principles for the subsystem are reviewed, and the design issues are discussed. In addition to the preliminary design performed under Phase I of the program, a breadboard system was developed to validate the proof-of-principle concept. Hardware implementation is reviewed and test results are presented. The brassboard development and engineering plans are also presented", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "Jul 1997", "inspec": "5641017", "date": "Jul 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "21 - 26", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
