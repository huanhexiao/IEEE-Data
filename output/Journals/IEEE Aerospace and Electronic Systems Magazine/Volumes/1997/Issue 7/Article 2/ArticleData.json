Nevertheless, with the availability of highly reliable and lower cost commercial parts, the QML approach becomes unnecessary and undesirable. In this paper we attempt to show why US government support of the QML program is leading the military and government to unaffordable access to out-dated technologies, damaging our country's military and avionics position. We will present information to show why we support the retraction of MIL-PRF-38535 and any other documents which imply that QML parts are superior to commercial parts, including those of QPL, MIL-STD-454, and MIL-HDBK-217 (now prohibited from use in all new Army programs)", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "39", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "42", "date_publication": "Jul 1997", "inspec": "5641021", "date": "Jul 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "39 - 42", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
