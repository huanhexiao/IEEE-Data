As published last year, some possibility of a fingerprint identification by means of 1D cut correlation has appeared. The first section of this paper deals with an improvement of our previous method based upon a 1D cut correlation. Originally a fingerprint photographic film record was used. Recently a fingerprint was displayed on a 2D hi-res LCD panel, SHARP. The second section of this paper is devoted to a comparative experimental verification of widely used JTC as a reference 2D correlation method. Finally, a set of experimental data for both techniques is presented", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "9", "date_publication": "Jul 1997", "inspec": "5641014", "date": "Jul 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "3 - 9", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
