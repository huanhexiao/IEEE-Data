The reference direction in azimuth is obtained by mounting a theodolite on the antenna, aiming it at a known position in the field and adjusting the azimuth reading. About 300 ARTEMIS sets, in various configurations, have been sold and, in spite of its much higher price when compared with DGPS, sales are continuing. Many sets were made gastight in view of security requirements on platforms. It is shown how a plotter can determine the course driven by a car on the road. The pen indicates accurately where the car was on the map. Advances in the technique of optical angle encoders are discussed", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "20", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "Aug 1997", "inspec": "5675672", "date": "Aug 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "20 - 22", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["E.
