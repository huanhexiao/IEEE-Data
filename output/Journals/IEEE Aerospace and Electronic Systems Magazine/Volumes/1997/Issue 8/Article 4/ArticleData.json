The proposed circuit is based on a heat pipe that includes the evaporation-condensation cycle. Different layouts based on this principle are presented. The proposed circuit is characterized by the following advantages: no need for an electromagnetic pump; low load on the converter; and a better capability to control temperature drop at the converter", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "27", "date_publication": "Aug 1997", "inspec": "5675673", "date": "Aug 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "23 - 27", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
