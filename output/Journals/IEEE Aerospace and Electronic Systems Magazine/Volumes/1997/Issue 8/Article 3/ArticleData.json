The authors indicate the planning of introduction of car radars in the near future according to information supplied by car companies. The purpose of the development of an automotive radar was to test different signal processing procedures both for distance and Doppler evaluation and also for a digital wavefront reconstruction to find out the angle position of a target. The block diagram, the main properties, the technical data of the radar system, the used antennas and the multiplexing of transmitting antennas is described. Finally some experimental results have been obtained under real traffic conditions", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "19", "date_publication": "Aug 1997", "inspec": "5675671", "date": "Aug 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "15 - 19", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["H.
