It appeared to the authors that this sensor technology might have the potential to solve some of the problems of sensors that are currently available. A proposal and program strategy was adopted capitalizing on the prior research in the area wherever it could be found from unclassified sources", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "9", "date_publication": "Aug 1997", "inspec": "5675670", "date": "Aug 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "3 - 9", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["F.
