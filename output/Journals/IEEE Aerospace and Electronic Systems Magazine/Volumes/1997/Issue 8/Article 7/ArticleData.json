The response of the battery voltage to a pulse with a current of 60 A and duration of 10 to 200 ms was measured, along with the capacity remaining at the end of pulse discharge. The maximum drop in voltage at the beginning of the pulse was 505 to 1,049 mV, and battery capacity remained stable", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "41", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "43", "date_publication": "Aug 1997", "inspec": "5675677", "date": "Aug 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "41 - 43", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["G.
