Test samples were procured from two different manufacturers and subjected to cycle testing at 33% and 100% depth-of-discharge (DOD). The cycle life at 33% DOD ranged from 500 to 750 cycles. The cycle life at 100% DOD ranged from 160 to 260 cycles", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "33", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "35", "date_publication": "Aug 1997", "inspec": "5675675", "date": "Aug 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "33 - 35", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
