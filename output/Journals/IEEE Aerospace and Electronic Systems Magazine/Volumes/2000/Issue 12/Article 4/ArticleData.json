The fuel cell uses zinc pellets and atmospheric oxygen to generate electric current; the reaction product is zinc oxide, which is collected in a tank. In its present stage of development the 36 V fuel cell will deliver approximately 6 kWh, with a maximum power of 4 kW. The device is refueled at a zinc recycling/refueling station where zinc pellets are pumped into each cell; ZnO is pumped from the tank and replaced with KOH electrolyte. The recycling/refueling unit uses an electrolytic process to convert zinc oxide powder into zinc pellets", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "Dec 2000", "inspec": "6799215", "date": "Dec 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "12", "pages": "19 - 22", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["S.
