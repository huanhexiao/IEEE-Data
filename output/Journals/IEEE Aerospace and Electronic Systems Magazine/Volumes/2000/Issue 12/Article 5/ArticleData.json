It will be created at our personal command to power our cars, homes, work, and communications. Electricity is the positive response to the drivers of: environmental factors, toxic emissions and greenhouse gases, improved energy efficiency, dispersion and decentralization. Internet, telecommunications, and satellites will increasingly tie people together globally. Fuel cells and batteries are the essential systems to develop for this age of personal electricity. History of the pathways of fuel cells will help guide the development of present and future electrical systems", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "7", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "Dec 2000", "inspec": "6799212", "date": "Dec 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "12", "pages": "7 - 10", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
