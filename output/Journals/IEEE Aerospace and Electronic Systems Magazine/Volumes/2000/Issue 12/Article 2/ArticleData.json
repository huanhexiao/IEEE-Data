Nickel metal hydride cells, introduced in 1992, have shown a 170 percent increase in energy density to be competitive on a volume basis with lithium ion. Other characteristics, such as charge retention, charge rate, high temperature operation, and rate capability have also advanced with improvements in materials and constructions. These two cell types account for roughly one half of the value of the small secondary battery market", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "Dec 2000", "inspec": "6799214", "date": "Dec 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "12", "pages": "15 - 18", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
