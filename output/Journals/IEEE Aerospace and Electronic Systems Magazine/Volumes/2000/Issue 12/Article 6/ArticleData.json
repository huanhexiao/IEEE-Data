Uniquely crucial components have been developed. Experimental measurements, when coupled with theoretical analysis predicts that 1 degree/hour performance can be achieved. Three critical elements required for the successful development have been demonstrated. A high quality trench waveguide has been designed, fabricated and demonstrated to have losses as little as 0.1 dB/cm. The waveguide has been demonstrated to have gain in the 4.0 dB/cm range. Finally, a waveguide laser has been fabricated and has shown nearly enough power to adequately drive an RMOG. Analysis of the measured performance predicts that a 1 degree/hour RMOG can be constructed. The small size and projected ruggedness of the RMOG will be advantageous in high G applications. Other applications, such as man portable guidance systems, where weight and size are critical, may also benefit from RMOG technology", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "33", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "36", "date_publication": "Dec 2000", "inspec": "6799218", "date": "Dec 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "12", "pages": "33 - 36", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
