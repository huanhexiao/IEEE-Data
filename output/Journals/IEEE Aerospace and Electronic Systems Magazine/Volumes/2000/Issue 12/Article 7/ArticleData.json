Even a bad mismatch of an unknown device cannot cause unpredictable results or test equipment failures if this straightforward method is applied. The proposed adaptive network analyzer covers frequencies between 100 kHz-50 MHz and regulates the test port power down to 10 dBm according to the return loss and, thus, reduces the risk of damage and, at the same time, improves resolution at the other end of the return loss scale above 25 dB. The rejection of the misleading effects of unwanted signals can be further improved by the built-in modulation", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "29", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "32", "date_publication": "Dec 2000", "inspec": "6799217", "date": "Dec 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "12", "pages": "29 - 32", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
