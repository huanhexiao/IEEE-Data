It argues that this functionality may be one mode in a multi-function UWB UHF system, which jointly possesses the capabilities for air target MTI and high resolution FOPEN SAR. The radar platform may be a UAV or an aircraft, whereas, we propose to use the push boom type of antenna mounting previously adopted with the advantage for the CARABAS II UWB VHF SAR. Presently, the push booms will hold a set of UWB UHF antenna elements. This paper relates GMTI to SAR, extended from imaging stationary ground to the 4-parameter set of targets in linear and uniform motion relative to ground. It is recognised that this extended imaging problem depends on one new parameter, i.e., the SAR focusing velocity. The required signal processing may be tackled in an efficient manner by a hierarchical scheme based on iteratively merging subapertures and increasing the resolution. Rejection of stationary clutter and detection occurs on all levels of increasing resolution. This paper also provides a brief presentation of the Swedish FOA efforts to produce an experimental demonstrator of this multi-function radar system", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "35", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "45", "date_publication": "May 2000", "inspec": "6606411", "date": "May 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "35 - 45", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["H.
