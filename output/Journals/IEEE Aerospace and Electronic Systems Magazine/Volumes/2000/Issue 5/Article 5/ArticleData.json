Our team has developed a layered hardware and software approach based on industry standard hardware and software interfaces to abstract the application (operational) software developers from the underlying technology rolls to the hardware and operating system software that naturally occur as part of the commercial marketplace, A technology roll is defined as the replacement of a current product with a subsequent generation of a product from the same product family. In this article, we describe the components and the layered architecture of our open system architecture approach. We discuss specific system, hardware, and software technology insertions that incorporate the latest available technology and how these changes have been abstracted from the application software. The article concludes by discussing lessons Learned from the use of these common components and corresponding technology rolls across various platforms", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "May 2000", "inspec": "6606408", "date": "May 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "19 - 23", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
