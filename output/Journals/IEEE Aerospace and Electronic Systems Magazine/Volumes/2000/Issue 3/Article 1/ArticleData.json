The FUSE instrument comprises many subsystems, each of which contributes in an essential way to the success of the mission. The instrument system engineer oversees the engineering of all elements in such a complex technical project. In performing system engineering for the FUSE instrument's command, telemetry, data processing and data storage functions, and in leading the engineering efforts for the development of the FUSE instrument on-board computer, the author has learned valuable lessons about the characteristics that are prerequisite to success for a space system engineer. These characteristics fall under various categories of acquired, practical know-how. These categories are described with illustrations drawn from the development of the FUSE instrument. In addition to these practical skills and the concomitant knowledge, the system engineer needs personal integrity, which is the link that connects knowledge with know-how and makes them work together to motivate a team of subsystem engineers. This, too, will be discussed", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "27", "date_publication": "Mar 2000", "inspec": "6553972", "date": "Mar 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "21 - 27", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
