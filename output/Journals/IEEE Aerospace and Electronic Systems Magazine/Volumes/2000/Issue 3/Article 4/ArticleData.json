One such system is the M56 multispectral smoke generator, which presently operates in the visible and infrared portions of the spectrum; a millimeter wave (MMW) Module is in development to extend the M56 spectral range. This paper documents preliminary results of a field demonstration test of the M56 MMW Module. An MMW instrumentation radar was modified to simulate the scan pattern and radar parameters of a tactical battlefield surveillance radar system. A test grid was populated with both stationary and moving tactical targets, and the radar scanned the grid to simulate a surveillance radar in operation. Once a realistic tactical engagement scenario was developed, MMW aerosols were deployed to demonstrate the impact such aerosols could have on radar detection and classification performance", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "20", "date_publication": "Mar 2000", "inspec": "6553971", "date": "Mar 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "11 - 20", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["B.
