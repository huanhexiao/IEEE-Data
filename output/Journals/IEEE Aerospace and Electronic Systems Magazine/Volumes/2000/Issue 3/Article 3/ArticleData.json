The soldier's increasing power demands dictate that alternatives to batteries be exploited wherever possible. Fuel cells promise significant advantages in terms of weight, coupled with cost and/or logistics benefits. Considerable progress has been made in reducing size and weight of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. The supply of hydrogen to PEM fuel cells has been one of the key barriers to introducing fuel cells to the military. The discussion will focus on several approaches being pursued", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "35", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "37", "date_publication": "Mar 2000", "inspec": "6561967", "date": "Mar 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "35 - 37", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
