Problems concerning fusion of these passive sonars are discussed. Three typical passive sonars-passive noise sonar, passive ranging sonar and acoustic pulse surveillance sonar-constitute a passive sonar system for data fusion. This paper is concerned mainly with problems of significance in system development, such as tactical application background, special fusion techniques and own-ship maneuver considerations", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "29", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "34", "date_publication": "Mar 2000", "inspec": "6553973", "date": "Mar 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "29 - 34", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
