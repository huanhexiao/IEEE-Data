The phenomenon of charge recovery that takes place under pulsed discharge conditions is identified as a mechanism that can be exploited to enhance the capacity of a cell in a portable communication device. The bursty nature of many data traffic sources suggests that data transmissions in communication devices may provide natural opportunities for charge recovery. We model the data source as a stochastic process and let the cell discharge be driven by such a process. We use a model of a dual lithium ion insertion cell to identify the improvement to cell capacity that results from the stochastic discharge. The insight from this study leads us to propose discharge shaping techniques that tradeoff energy efficiency with delay in the required current supply", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "41", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "45", "date_publication": "Aug 2000", "inspec": "6686814", "date": "Aug 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "41 - 45", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
