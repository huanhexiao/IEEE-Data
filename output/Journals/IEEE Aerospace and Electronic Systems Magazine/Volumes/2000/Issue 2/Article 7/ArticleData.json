Unfortunately, test requirements are seldom captured in a consistent format that may be processed by a computer, thus eliminating the possibility of using such requirements in an engineering application. Additionally, such an approach disallows test requirements captured in one segment of the product life cycle to be reused in subsequent life cycle stages. This paper describes a model-based methodology, specifically the Test Requirements Model (TeRM), which can be shown to facilitate the transfer of test-related product information between various stages of the life cycle. This transportability, in conjunction with an exchange format that can be processed by a computer, permits test requirement information to support value-added applications in the engineering process throughout the life cycle of a product", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "39", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "44", "date_publication": "Feb 2000", "inspec": "6539839", "date": "Feb 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "39 - 44", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["E.
