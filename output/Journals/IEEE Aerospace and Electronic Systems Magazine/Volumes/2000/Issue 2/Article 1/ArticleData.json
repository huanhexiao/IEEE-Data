This paper will address the fundamental problems faced in the stability studies of these systems, both prior to, and after, their implementation. Furthermore, a brief description of the type of system, definitions of large-signal and small-signal stability which are applicable to these types of systems, methods of system modeling and simulation, concept of negative impedance instability, and recommendations on methods of stability analysis for these systems will be given.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "Feb. 2000", "inspec": "6539837", "date": "Feb. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "25 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
