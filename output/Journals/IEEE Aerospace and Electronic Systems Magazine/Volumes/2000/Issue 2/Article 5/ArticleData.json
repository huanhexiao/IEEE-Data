The application uses components such as: active acoustic radar based on a phase array of microphones, with techniques of beamforming, and multibeam detection schemes; efficient compression algorithms and video transmission in real time. The system is composed of an arbitrary number of sensors (monitoring probes), distributed by the monitoring space, a data network and a central server (monitoring manager). The sensors consist of a microprocessor, with its memory and three main modules: (1) acoustic radar; (2) video capture card; and (3) network card. The flexibility of the system allows new modules to be added such as: personal detector card; sound card; cards for telecontrol; etc. The sensor microprocessor preprocesses the information received by the modules, packs and transmits it to the central server through a data network. The system uses IP protocol, and SNMPv2 for management", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Feb 2000", "inspec": "6539835", "date": "Feb 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "9 - 16", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
