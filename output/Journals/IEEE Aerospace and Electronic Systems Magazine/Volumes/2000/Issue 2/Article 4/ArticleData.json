The biometric technique chosen has been hand geometry, which is considered to provide low/medium security (there are other much more secure, as fingerprint, iris or retina), to be easy to use, to achieve high acceptance by users, and which performance is given throughout fast processing and medium cost. Also, the small template size needed for each user is positive for storage and processing capabilities required in the system. But the innovation in the system proposed is that the smart card not only stores the user's template, but also performs the verification process with the features set by the terminal to the card. With this improvement, the security of the system has risen because the template is never extracted from the card, avoiding duplication of such sensible data. The specifications for the enrolment process will be presented as well as the applications where this new system is recommended", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "45", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "48", "date_publication": "Feb 2000", "inspec": "6539840", "date": "Feb 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "45 - 48", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
