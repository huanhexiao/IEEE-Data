The goal of this particle physics experiment project was to detect antimatter in space. Some aspects of the HRD link performance are discussed", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "33", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "36", "date_publication": "Jan 2000", "inspec": "6516470", "date": "Jan 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "33 - 36", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
