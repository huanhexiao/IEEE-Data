The Voice Control system is reliable, speaker independent, and has a total added hardware price tag of under $50.00 per station. In contrast to traditional voice recognition systems, operator training is not required. OO-ALC has developed a general-purpose internal interface (Voice Control) to the Speech Recognition and Text-To-Speech engines provided by Microsoft. Voice Control can be accessed by any 32-bit Windows software, which has windows messaging capability. This is available to standard programming languages such as LabWindows CVI, Borland or Microsoft C/C++, Visual Basic, or even commercial packages such as Lotus Notes and Microsoft Word. Through Voice Control, the computer uses both video and voice prompts to request input from the operator. The operator is allowed to enter data and to control the software flow by voice command or from the keyboard or mouse. The Voice Control system allows for dynamic specification of a grammar set, or legal set of commands. The use of a reduced grammar set greatly increases recognition accuracy. The computer voice enables the operator to focus his attention away from the computer screen, which is required for activities such as probing a circuit card and taking readings. When the operator takes readings, the computer, to insure reliable entry, echoes his voice entries. With electronic tuning, speech synthesis allows the operator to hear the resulting reading, enabling him to focus on the circuit card instead of constantly turning his head to see the computer screen.
