Initial SATCOM systems provided trunk telephony through large, fixed stations; current systems offer many services to smaller, fixed and mobile terminals. Personal Communications Systems, when fully implemented, will allow individuals to communicate with \"anyone, anywhere, anytime,\" and thus transform the world into a truly global village. New systems (currently being planned) will offer innovative services, such as computer networking and multimedia to the expanding mass market at an affordable cost. The rate of SATCOM progress shows no sign of slowing, and this revolution is expected to continue well into the future.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "95", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "107", "date_publication": "Oct. 2000", "inspec": "6750896", "date": "Oct. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "95 - 107", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": [], "keywords": ["VSAT networks", "mobile satellite communication", "multimedia communication", "personal communication networks", "satellite ground stations", "satellite links", "technological forecasting", "Earth stations", "INTELSAT system", "SATCOM technology", "VSAT", "affordable cost", "coding", "commercial viability", "computer networking", "emerging systems", "future progress", "innovative services", "land mobile satellite systems", "mass market", "multimedia", "personal communications systems", "satellite communication", "satellite links", "Artificial satellites", "Communication industry", "Consumer electronics", "Costs", "NASA", "Optical transmitters", "Relays", "Satellite broadcasting", "Satellite communication", "Space technology", ""], "arnumber": "879427"}
