The widespread use of GPS navigation and increasing complexity of passenger entertainment systems have become the latest electronics trends on large commercial aircraft. The cost of avionics plus software is approaching 50% of the total. New aircraft have multiple computers and millions of lines of software. The following sections present the most important avionics subsystems and highlight some differences between military and commercial aircraft.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "47", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "61", "date_publication": "Oct. 2000", "inspec": "6750889", "date": "Oct. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "47 - 61", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": [], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "aircraft computers", "aircraft control", "avionics", "entertainment", "standards", "GPS navigation", "avionics", "avionics subsystems", "commercial aircraft", "cost", "high-density airspace", "international regulations", "military aircraft", "over-ocean airways", "passenger entertainment", "xweather", "Aerospace electronics", "Aircraft navigation", "Artificial satellites", "Computer vision", "Costs", "Frequency", "Global Positioning System", "Military aircraft", "Military computing", "Satellite broadcasting", ""], "arnumber": "879408"}
