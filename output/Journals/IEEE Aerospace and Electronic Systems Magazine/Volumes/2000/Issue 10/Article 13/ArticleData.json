A similar duopoly exists very nearly for US military aircraft. In 1999, mergers created two large avionic suppliers in the USA. European avionics suppliers have also been consolidating. At worst, these larger entities will have a negative effect upon US aerospace employment, and further discourage the best and brightest engineers. Commuter and general aviation, where competition still reigns (more than ten manufacturers exist in 2000), may lead the avionics charge into the future.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "79", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "82", "date_publication": "Oct. 2000", "inspec": "6750893", "date": "Oct. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "79 - 82", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": [], "keywords": ["air traffic control", "aircraft control", "aircraft instrumentation", "military aircraft", "ATC", "European avionics suppliers", "US aerospace", "US military aircraft", "aerospace industry", "avionics manufacturer", "cockpit displays", "control systems", "defense", "design", "military electronics", "production", "warning systems", "Aerospace electronics", "Aerospace engineering", "Aircraft navigation", "Airports", "Control systems", "Costs", "Global Positioning System", "Military aircraft", "Satellite navigation systems", "Transportation", ""], "arnumber": "879419"}
