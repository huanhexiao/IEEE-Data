The term automatic test equipment (ATE) encompasses all phases of computer controlled testing. It is based on the integration of instruments, computers and software. These systems generally include five basic elements: control, stimulus, measurement, switching and software. A special interface device or interface test adapter connects the unit under test (UUT) to the ATE. Test program software connects the ATE to the appropriate UUT test points, programs the input stimulus and monitors the output response.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "125", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "130", "date_publication": "Oct. 2000", "inspec": "6750899", "date": "Oct. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "125 - 130", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": [], "keywords": ["IEEE standards", "automatic test equipment", "automatic test software", "military avionics", "military standards", "peripheral interfaces", "virtual instrumentation", "COTS use", "Firewire", "GPIB", "IEEE test standards", "VXI plug&amp", "play", "automated testing", "automatic sequencing", "automatic test equipment", "computer controlled testing", "fault isolation", "interchangeable virtual instruments", "interface test adapter", "military avionics", "military electronics maintenance", "test program software", "third generation ATE", "Automatic control", "Automatic test equipment", "Automatic testing", "Control systems", "Electron tubes", "Instruments", "Logic testing", "Software testing", "Switches", "System testing", ""], "arnumber": "879434"}
