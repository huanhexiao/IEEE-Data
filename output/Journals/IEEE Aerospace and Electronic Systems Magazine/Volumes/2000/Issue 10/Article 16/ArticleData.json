It was developed by the US Department of Defense as a precise navigation reference for the military services. Although the signal available to civilian users had been purposely degraded in what is called selective availability (SA), it is one of a few technological success stories that had positive unintended consequences. Recent announcements indicate that this SA impediment has been removed. GPS currently has a huge civilian market in commercial and private aviation, ship navigation, mapping and surveying, telecommunications position determination, and recreational boating and hiking. By 2003 sales of GPS based products are expected to be $16 billion.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "89", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "95", "date_publication": "Oct. 2000", "inspec": "6750895", "date": "Oct. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "89 - 95", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": [], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "technological forecasting", "GPS code", "GPS satellites", "Global Positioning System", "civilian market", "commercial aviation", "differential GPS", "high tech utility", "mapping", "private aviation", "recreational activities", "selective availability removal", "ship navigation", "surveying", "telecommunications position determination", "triangulation", "Extraterrestrial measurements", "Global Positioning System", "IEEE news", "Marine vehicles", "Radio navigation", "Satellite broadcasting", "Satellite navigation systems", "Space exploration", "Space technology", "Time measurement", ""], "arnumber": "879425"}
