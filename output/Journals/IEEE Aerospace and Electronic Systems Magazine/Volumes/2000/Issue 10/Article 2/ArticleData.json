In its simplest form systems engineering is the design of the whole as opposed to the design of the parts. The vast number, complexity and diversity of elements can overwhelm and degrade system performance and reliability. Embedded processing and software can be both a boon and a bane. A systems engineer analyzes and optimizes an ensemble of elements that relate to the flow of energy, mass and communications into a design that performs the desired function. \"Systems engineering\" is used herein to cover a very broad spectrum of processes and controls to engineer a product at the many levels required to satisfy all aspects of the original requirement. Our definition is not intended to either include or exclude systems engineering and integration as used in the computer field. In any case, systems engineering is the application of solid engineering principles to design and develop a large enterprise within cost and schedule to satisfy the needs of the ultimate user. It involves conceptualization, design, development, test, implementation, approval/certification and operation (including human factors) of a system. In essence, systems engineering is a problem-solving discipline for the modern world.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "Oct. 2000", "inspec": "6750884", "date": "Oct. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "9 - 10", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": [], "keywords": ["systems engineering", "approval/certification", "communications", "conceptualization", "design", "development", "embedded processing", "embedded software", "flow of energy", "human factors", "implementation", "mass", "operation", "systems engineering", "test", "Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society", "Degradation", "Design engineering", "Design optimization", "Embedded software", "Performance analysis", "Power engineering and energy", "Reliability engineering", "System performance", "Systems engineering and theory", ""], "arnumber": "879392"}
