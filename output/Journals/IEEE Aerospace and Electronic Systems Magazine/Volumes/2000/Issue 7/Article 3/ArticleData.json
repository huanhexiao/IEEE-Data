The Interchangeable Virtual Instruments (IVI) Foundation was formed in August 1997 to define standard specifications for programming common test instrument capabilities. The paper will present the major architectural aspects of digital test instrumentation and how those features can be grouped into classes for the purpose of writing an instrument independent driver. Topics discussed will include derivation of capability classes, class extensions, simulation, and range checking. Examples of how the IVI digital class would apply to the Teradyne M9-Series Digital Test Instrument will be included. Conclusions will summarize the unique attributes of digital test instrumentation, the benefits which can be achieved through standardization, and the tradeoffs associated with utilizing class extensions", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "10", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "14", "date_publication": "Jul 2000", "inspec": "6659713", "date": "Jul 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "10 - 14", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
