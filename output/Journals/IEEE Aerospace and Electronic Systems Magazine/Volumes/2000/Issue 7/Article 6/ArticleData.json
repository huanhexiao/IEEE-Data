The system monitors all activity in the surveillance area, the vast majority of which is people innocently going about their normal business. It will alarm when the observed activities of particular pedestrians and vehicles match any of the pre-defined \u201csuspicious behaviour criteria\u201d programmed into the system. At the same time as analysing movement behaviour, the system uses computer-controlled pan tilt zoom cameras to obtain close-up video recordings of any pedestrians and vehicles at the scene. The system can provide automatic surveillance in many different situations, from parking areas and commercial districts, to housing, recreational and transport facilities. It is particularly suited to the protection of government or commercial buildings located on city streets or other public areas where it is not possible to install perimeter fences", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "9", "date_publication": "Jul 2000", "inspec": "6659712", "date": "Jul 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "3 - 9", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["G.
