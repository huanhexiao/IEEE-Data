Examples found using such equipment and reported in this paper include a cell whose voltage vacillated daily while on float, post/strap joints whose accept/reject connection integrity was erratic with time, chargers whose voltages were improperly set (both high and low), and a battery room environment whose conditions were life-shortening to electrolytic cells", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "41", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "47", "date_publication": "Jul 2000", "inspec": "6659717", "date": "Jul 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "41 - 47", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["T.
