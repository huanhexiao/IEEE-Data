The VIA architecture can also be easily extended to meet unique military requirements of the advanced military flight decks for military tanker/transport upgrade programs. The subtle changes in the architecture are a result of unique equipment interfaces and unique military equipment such as communications radios, identification friend or foe, station keeping equipment and defensive systems which must be integrated within the architecture. The ability to integrate both commercial and military functions in the same high integrity computing platform truly offers the military the best of both worlds.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "33", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "39", "date_publication": "July 2000", "inspec": "6659716", "date": "July 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "33 - 39", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
