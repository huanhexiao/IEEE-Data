Namely the two functions are Routing and Guidance. Routing provides a means to suggest to the airport ground control a best path from any given point on the airfield to any other given point according to a number of constraints and rules. Guidance provides an interface between the system and the pilot and provides guidance aids to the pilot in order to have the airplane on the route generated by the Routing function. Both Functions have been developed under the European Union \u201cVision\u201d project, in the frame of the Telematics Application Program. A complete A-SMGCS is working now at Navia with simulation scenarios for various airports and will be installed and tested at, at least, two of them. The system is completely modular and can be installed in a number of configurations. In fact, every function is a self-contained program, communicating with each other by the means of computer networks", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "Jul 2000", "inspec": "6659714", "date": "Jul 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "15 - 23", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["E.
