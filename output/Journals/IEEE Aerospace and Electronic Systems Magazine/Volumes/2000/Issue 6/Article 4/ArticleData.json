Trip to the Orient via the Moon", "abstract": "Early in the sixties when President Kennedy announced the goal to land a man on the Moon and return him safely to Earth, there was no way to gauge, accurately and reliably, the millions of pounds of fuel and oxidizer in the proposed rocket. Late in the sixties, when Phillips Petroleum and Marathon Oil contracted to provide large-scale, long term, ocean transport of Liquefied Natural Gas, no system existed to satisfactorily gauge this stream of high value cargoes for commercial transactions. The adventure in solving these related problems led to a worldwide market for LNG Custody Transfer Systems, a successful transfer of technology from a NASA program to commercial use", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "Jun 2000", "inspec": "6638751", "date": "Jun 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "18 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
