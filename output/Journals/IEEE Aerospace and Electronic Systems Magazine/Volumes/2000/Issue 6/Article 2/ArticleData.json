IEC's development has been in the utilization of silicon-based micro-machine technology for the inertial sensor, high levels of processor integration, and hardware function consolidation, making the guidance package inherently immune to the vibration and high G shock effects of the launch. In addition, the size and power are sufficiently reduced to fit the constraints of the fuse well. While a GPS \u201conly\u201d-based guidance system seemed an ideal solution for the lowest cost implementation of smart weapon guidance, the potential for signal jamming meant that a GPS \u201conly\u201d solution would not be able to guide the projectile to the target. To resolve this limitation, an anti-jam (AJ) capability had to be incorporated into the GPS receiver, and a miniature on-board inertial measurement unit (IMU) had to be part of the system. Initial laboratory tests have proven that the GPS/inertial guidance system, enhanced with a robust, low-cost AJ subsystem, performs consistently well under simulated battlefield conditions", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "17", "date_publication": "Jun 2000", "inspec": "6638750", "date": "Jun 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "15 - 17", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
