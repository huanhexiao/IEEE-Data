However, it also brings new possibilities for thieves. This is mainly because we have not completely solved the growing problem of computer viruses and Trojans that can act on our computers against our will. Several methods are used against them, although none can be considered 100% effective. Even more, most personal computers have little or no virus protection, so they are very easy to attack. This can become a problem as nearly all PC banking systems rely on authentication with identification passwords. This system is vulnerable and we will show that it does not provide enough protection for the users that want to make transfer operations from their accounts", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "Jun 2000", "inspec": "6638748", "date": "Jun 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "3 - 8", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["F. de la Puente", "S.
