The use of commercial hardware and software products, combined with an error- and fault-tolerant architecture, resulted in a low-cost design without adversely affecting overall reliability. The processor's architecture and mechanical design, and hardware and software test and validation methods are described.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "19", "date_publication": "Nov 2000", "inspec": "6791556", "date": "Nov 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "11", "pages": "15 - 19", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
