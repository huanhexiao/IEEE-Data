Since individual customers use the vehicles, Honda developed a battery service and evaluation system convenient to customers, yet not burdensome to dealer service. This paper discusses the method of detection of low battery capacity, the technique used to convey this information to users, the bench evaluation system of returned batteries, and explains how the analysis is utilized to enhance the EV PLUS' battery control strategy.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "Nov 2000", "inspec": "6791557", "date": "Nov 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "11", "pages": "21 - 25", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
