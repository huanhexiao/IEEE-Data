Increased levels of information exchange will be necessary for this concept to work safely; therefore, air-ground communications will transition from voice to data link communications. The nature of data link communications procurement requires that avionics suppliers not only verify their products meet contractual performance requirements, but also demonstrate that their products are compatible with civil communication networks and ATC. In addition, the USAF needs to demonstrate that their crew-training program is adequate to maintain the required level of aircrew proficiency and equipment can be maintained for the required level of system performance, integrity, and interoperability with the civil environment. This paper outlines some of the certification issues facing the USAF with respect to the \"Approval for Use\" of data link equipment to be used for communication with ATC. It will also suggest a methodology for the avionics supplier and USAF to obtain the approvals required to ensure the installation of data link communications equipment on military aircraft will remain interoperable with civil ATC.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "14", "date_publication": "Nov 2000", "inspec": "6791555", "date": "Nov 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "11", "pages": "9 - 14", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
