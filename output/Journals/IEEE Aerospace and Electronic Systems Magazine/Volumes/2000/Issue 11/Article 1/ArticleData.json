Nevertheless, speech variability is a main degradation factor in speaker recognition tasks. Both intra-speaker and external variability sources produce mismatch between training and testing phases. In this contribution, channel and inter-session variability are explored in order to accomplish real automatic systems for both commercial and forensic speaker recognition. Results are presented making use of \"AHUMADA\", a subset of \"GAUDI\" large speaker recognition-oriented database in Spanish.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "32", "date_publication": "Nov 2000", "inspec": "6791558", "date": "Nov 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "11", "pages": "27 - 32", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
