The Voyager I and II spacecraft successfully completed their original 12 year missions 10 years ago and are at distances of over 55 AU and 70 AU from the sun. The power systems worked almost precisely as predicted. The Voyager spacecraft seem to have several decades of life left to make measurements outside the solar system.
