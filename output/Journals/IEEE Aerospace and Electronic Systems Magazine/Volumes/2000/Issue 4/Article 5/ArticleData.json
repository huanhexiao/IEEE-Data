Fibre-optic interferometric sensors can be designed as compact and robust transducers. In general, the transduction mechanism involves the phase modulation of coherent or monochromatic light propagating through a fibre-optic cable, and detecting the changes in the energy associated with this phase change. Sensors based on this technique can generally be configured to be quite sensitive and measurements of a wide variety of physical parameters are achievable. Intrinsic features of optical fibres, such as immunity to electromagnetic interference, flexibility, thinness, strength and weight, make this ideal for sensor technology. In the process of developing fibre-optic sensors for laboratory experimentation, as well as generalised research, an appropriate, easy to use opto-electronic drive and measurement system is required.
