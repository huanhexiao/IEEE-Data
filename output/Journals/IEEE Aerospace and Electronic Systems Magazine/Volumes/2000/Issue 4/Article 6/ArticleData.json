ATE systems may be in the form of large general-purpose systems that can test a wide variety of products or the more commonly used custom, turnkey systems that are designed for specific test application(s) and requirements. Turnkey ATE systems are labor-intensive; as a result, even a relatively simple turnkey tester is costly and may take months (or even years) to develop, integrate, and deploy. The main reason for this aspect of turnkey ATE systems is that even though the instrumentation may be off-the-shelf components, most everything else is custom and requires design, development, extensive debug and integration. Time and again, systems integrators have tried to find a solution that would combine the cost effectiveness of COTS systems with the flexibility of custom ATE. This paper suggests a solution to this problem and that it is feasible to combine COTS testers with custom requirements. This solution, called CreATE, provides a flexible architecture using COTS components (including instruments, cabling and interfacing products)", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "Apr 2000", "inspec": "6585335", "date": "Apr 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "4", "pages": "19 - 22", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["L.
