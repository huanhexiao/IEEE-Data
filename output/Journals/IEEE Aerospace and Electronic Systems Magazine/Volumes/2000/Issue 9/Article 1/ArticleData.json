This policy has been incorporated into DoD 5000 2-R of 15 March 1996 (with Change 3 of 23 March 1998), which is intended to define an acquisition environment that makes DoD the smartest, most responsive buyer of the best goods or services that meet our warfighters' needs at the best dollar value to the DoD over the life of the product. DoD 5000 2-R policy is implemented in the area of ATS by: 1) leveraging non-recurring investments already made in ATS Families across multiple applications; 2) evolving the capabilities of these Families of ATS by migrating their commercial item content toward industry-wide standards; 3) facilitating intra- and inter-service level interoperability by encouraging common and interoperable support solutions; and 4) encouraging the use of commercial items within ATS Families and as ATS alternatives. To implement this policy, the DoD ATS Executive Agent was chartered to establish and maintain a waiver process for those programs that propose not to use the DoD designated standard families of ATS or commercial testers. Contrary to popular belief, the DoD ATS Selection Process has been established to facilitate the mission of the DoD Program Manager by helping him or her choose the most cost effective ATS solution that fulfils his or her mission support requirements. The DoD ATS family was not established to impose support solutions upon the DoD Program Manager, but rather to provide a variety of available and proven alternatives that may meet their needs while significantly reducing expected life cycle costs. Where obvious cost, schedule, or performance deficiencies exist with DoD family members for supporting a given weapon system, service ATS representatives provide the knowledge and expertise to help identify suitable alternatives", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "Sep 2000", "inspec": "6730383", "date": "Sep 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "21 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
