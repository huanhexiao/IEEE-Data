The hybrid power sources successfully operated the LW cyclic load beyond the capabilities of the specific single chemistry systems studied. The zinc-air battery hybrids allowed approximately triple the operation time of PEMFC hybrids. The best performing hybrid system was the zinc-air battery/lead-acid battery. It provided the greatest operating voltage and longest operating time", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "37", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "41", "date_publication": "Sep 2000", "inspec": "6730386", "date": "Sep 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "37 - 41", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["L.
