We present quantifiable measures of navigation accuracy as a function of GPS user segment parameters. These user segment parameters include antenna phase response accuracy, single versus dual frequency, and Kalman filter structure and size. We also formulate some new phase-locked loop (PLL) filter designs for application in GPS receivers, and demonstrate their superiority over more conventional filters", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "37", "date_publication": "Jan 1995", "inspec": "4872399", "date": "Jan 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "31 - 37", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
