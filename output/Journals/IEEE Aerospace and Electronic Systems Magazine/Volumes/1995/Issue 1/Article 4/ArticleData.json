The resulting drive to slash operating expenses has bolstered development of avionics industry standards for automated test equipment. Rockwell's Collins Air Transport Division (CATD) has begun to market compliant test gear that airline maintenance departments wishing to acquire modern high performance test systems without the development cost penalty have eagerly received. A similar situation now confronts the military. The various branches can no longer justify the maintenance of independent autotest architectures. This paper describes the CATD implementation of the commercial-standard architecture; shows how we have designed the system to avoid obsolescence; and indicates the considerations that are necessary for adapting it to military scenarios", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "Jan 1995", "inspec": "4872396", "date": "Jan 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "19 - 22", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
