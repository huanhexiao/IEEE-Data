Furthermore, should the ATE fail to operate, impacts to the systems which it supports must also be minimized", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "27", "date_publication": "Jan 1995", "inspec": "4872397", "date": "Jan 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "23 - 27", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["A.
