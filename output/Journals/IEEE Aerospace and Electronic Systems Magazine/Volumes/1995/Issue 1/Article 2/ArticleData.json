The current draw can be plotted against time, showing a characteristic trace for the test performed. Sensors in the ATS power supply can be used to monitor the current flow during test execution. Defective components can be classified using a Neural Network according to the pattern of variation from the \u201ctrace\u201d of a good card. This can be performed as a background function, with the network gaining in accuracy over time.
