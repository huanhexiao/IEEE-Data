The approach is predicated upon the use of an automated concurrent engineering tool set that is utilized to develop a diagnostic knowledge base which is subsequently incorporated into a microcontroller's diagnostic run-time system. Examples of centralized and distributed architectures utilizing the subject approach are described", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "13", "date_publication": "Jan 1995", "inspec": "4872394", "date": "Jan 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "1", "pages": "9 - 13", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
