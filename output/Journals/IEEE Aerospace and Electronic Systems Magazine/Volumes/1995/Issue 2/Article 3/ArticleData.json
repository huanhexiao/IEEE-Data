ASCAS has formed a strategic business enterprise which is dedicated to developing the avionics market within the CIS. ASCAS was fortunate to find a joint venture partner who possesses skills that complement its present core competencies. The advantage of this business arrangement is that, while expanding their experience and expertise in the area of systems integration, they can directly benefit from the expertise and capabilities of indigenous airframe and equipment manufacturers (customer knowledge, simulation and integration experience, capable/skilled manpower)", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "8", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "Feb 1995", "inspec": "4900387", "date": "Feb 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "8 - 12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["F.
