Heretofore the listed ECCM effects have generally been to counteract the effects of ECM. This approach is one of attempting to cure an illness, rather than preventing it. Modem ECM systems usually include an ESM receiver to detect the radar signal, identify it by its emission characteristics, assess its importance, select the proper ECM, and signal to initiate ECM. If the ESM receiver detection of the radar signal can be delayed/denied, or the identification be confused, either the wrong ECM may be applied, or delayed. The radar may thus not be confronted with timely, proper ECM. Radar operation may therefore be possible. This paper introduces and defines CESM, a new category of radar ECCM. There are two principles of CESM-those which delay/deny ESM receiver detection, and those which confuse/impede signal identification. Illustrative examples of CESM techniques/operating techniques are given. It is shown that many CESM techniques may have multiple roles by impeding detection, impeding identification, and also diluting effects of ECM", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "36", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "38", "date_publication": "Feb 1995", "inspec": "4900392", "date": "Feb 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "36 - 38", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["S.
