This was the first ever airborne demonstration of a 2 \u03bcm diode-pumped solid-state Doppler LIDAR. The LIDAR performance was verified by comparing the true-airspeed (TAS) estimate with that found using the pneumatic air data system; excellent agreement was found. The capabilities of this pulsed 2 \u03bcm Doppler LIDAR system include high bandwidth air data determination without the need for extensive forebody calibration, remote wind profiling as far as several kilometers away from the aircraft, eye-safe laser transmission at 2 \u03bcm, and diode-pumped solid-state design for compact construction and reliable performance.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "Feb. 1995", "inspec": "4900390", "date": "Feb. 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "23 - 28", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["T.
