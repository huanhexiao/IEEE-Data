A Bell 206L Jet Ranger helicopter was used to evaluate the capability of the sensor as a detector of various types of terrain collision hazards. The sensor was composed of a covert, spread spectrum radar altimeter processor driving a 35 GHz converter and antenna assembly mounted on a steerable platform. Excellent correlation between predicted performance and observed performance was obtained", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "Feb 1995", "inspec": "4900389", "date": "Feb 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "2", "pages": "19 - 22", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
