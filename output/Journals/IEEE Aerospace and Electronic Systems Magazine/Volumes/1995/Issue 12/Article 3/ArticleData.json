The quantity of this debris is growing every year as a result of on-going activities in space. Much of the debris consists of particles which are too small to be tracked from the ground, but nevertheless pose a threat to spacecraft. This paper examines the possibility of an orbiting radar which, over a period of time, could measure debris positions and velocities and thereby build up a database of debris orbits. Spacecraft could use this database for advance warning of impending collisions and maneuver themselves out of the collision path, thereby mitigating the long-term risk of collision damage.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "10", "date_publication": "Dec. 1995", "inspec": "5149552", "date": "Dec. 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
