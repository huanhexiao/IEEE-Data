An analysis of requirements is given, design trade-offs are accounted for, and main features of prototypes in manufacturing are detailed. The radar has been thoroughly tested and evaluated both under \"controlled\" conditions and on roads, also in dense traffic. Results so far are very promising.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "10", "date_publication": "Dec. 1995", "inspec": "5149551", "date": "Dec. 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["L.
