A versatile model of a Radar System is detailed as an example and its attributes from a teaching perspective are highlighted. The generic nature of the environment is also described, as is its position within the systems life cycle.", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "10", "date_publication": "Dec. 1995", "inspec": "5149550", "date": "Dec. 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "12", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
