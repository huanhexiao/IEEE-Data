Techniques for suppressing range sidelobes are well known but without prior knowledge of the scattering medium's velocity distribution their performance degrades rapidly in the presence of Doppler. Recent investigations have presented a \u201cdoppler tolerant\u201d range sidelobe suppression technique. The thrust of the work described herein is the extension of previous simulations to actual transmitted dispersed/coded waveforms using the S-band surveillance radar located at Rome Laboratory Surveillance Facility. The objectives of the experiment are: 1) to extend the verification of the simulation of the Doppler tolerant technique; and 2) to demonstrate that the radar transmitter, waveform generator, and receiver imperfections do not significantly degrade resolution, performance or reliability of meteorological spectral moment estimates", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "37", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "43", "date_publication": "Aug 1995", "inspec": "5069668", "date": "Aug 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "37 - 43", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["N.
