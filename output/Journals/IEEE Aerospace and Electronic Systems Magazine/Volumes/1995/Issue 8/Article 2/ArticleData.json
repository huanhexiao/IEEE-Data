Non-aqueous (organic) carbon based laboratory monopolar devices have recently met key U.S. Department of Energy (DoE) mid-term specifications (> 5 WNkg, >500 W/kg and >100,000 life cycles) for load-leveling electric vehicles batteries. All DLC technologies currently under development by DoE are discussed. Each technology has distinct advantages and none are clear winners at this time. A study has been completed by the General Electric Company on the interface electronics needed to best utilize the energy of capacitors for load-leveling batteries. System costs are presented based on this study, several battery technologies, and capacitor projections", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "26", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "31", "date_publication": "Aug 1995", "inspec": "5069665", "date": "Aug 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "26 - 31", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["E.
