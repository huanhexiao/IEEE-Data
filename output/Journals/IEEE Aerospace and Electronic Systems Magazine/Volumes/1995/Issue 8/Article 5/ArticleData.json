A patent disclosure includes, among other things, a description of the embodiment which reads like a technical article, and a set of claims, which reads like a legal document: the claims often depend on each other in a complicated way. While preparing material for a UK, US and Canadian patent with my patent attorney, I have found the claims to be the most difficult to keep organised: it is only too easy to leave something out, or to get the dependencies mixed up. The author has found it useful to summarise the claims in tabular form, and a simple dependency table is given", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "32", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "33", "date_publication": "Aug 1995", "inspec": "5069666", "date": "Aug 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "32 - 33", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["T.
