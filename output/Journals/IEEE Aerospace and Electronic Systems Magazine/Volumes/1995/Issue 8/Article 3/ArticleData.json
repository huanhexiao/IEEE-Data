The rigidity of this SMES originating from the electromagnetic forces within it, can eliminate the need for mechanical building blocks for support structure. This force can also be used for the deployment of the system in space. In addition, the storage capability of the system allows its use in low Earth orbit (LEO) which reduces the launching and transmission costs. The paper also discusses the basic design and the operation of the proposed SPS system", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "14", "date_publication": "Aug 1995", "inspec": "5069662", "date": "Aug 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "8", "pages": "9 - 14", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
