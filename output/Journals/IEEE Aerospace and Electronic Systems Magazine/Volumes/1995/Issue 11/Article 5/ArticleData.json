This information is intended to help potential users evaluate the systems for specific applications. The systems profiled in this article can be used for commercial purposes; some have been built specifically for commercial use while others also serve as science and research tools, Both domestic and foreign systems designed for government agencies and private industry are profiled. Nine of these systems are currently operational; two systems are scheduled to begin service in the near future. A third system is no longer active, but archive data are commercially available", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "Nov 1995", "inspec": "5135514", "date": "Nov 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "11", "pages": "15 - 23", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
