This paper summarizes the in-house designed and built solar blind ultraviolet communications system used in the LCL to investigate non-line-of-sight data and voice links. It also summarizes some of the previous DoD work accomplished to exploit free space communications via ultraviolet radiation. In addition, safety factors peculiar to ultraviolet radiation in a closed cockpit environment are addressed. An evaluation of the current electrodeless ultraviolet communications system and a synopsis of planned future projects to improve the system are included in the paper", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "2", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "7", "date_publication": "Nov 1995", "inspec": "5135512", "date": "Nov 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "11", "pages": "2 - 7", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
