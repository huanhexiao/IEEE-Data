A study was done as part of life cycling, to determine the necessity of reconditioning and its effect on the cell performance. A 36 Ah nickel/hydrogen cell was put on a GEO simulated cycling at 15\u00b0C without reconditioning up to four eclipse seasons. The effect of reconditioning on the fifth and sixth eclipse seasons was studied. The study has conclusively proven the need for reconditioning and has shown the benefits of a high rate reconditioning. It has also been possible to draw some conclusions about the effect of a long duration trickle charge on the positive electrode", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "26", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "Apr 1995", "inspec": "4976859", "date": "Apr 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "4", "pages": "26 - 29", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
