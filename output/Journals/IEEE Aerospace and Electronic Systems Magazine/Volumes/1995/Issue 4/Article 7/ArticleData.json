These developments have resulted in many more options in selecting the battery type for use in a particular project, but since most applications today are opting for rechargeable battery systems, the availability of battery charging solutions can become an equally important criteria in the selection process. Complicating this process are the demands for fast-but safe-charging with charge algorithms easily implemented with low-cost hardware. With the higher levels of complexity attendant with these more demanding algorithms, solutions have come primarily from the integrated circuit industry and the purpose of this paper is to provide a few examples of the latest efforts in this arena, specifically as addressed to lead-acid, nickel metal-hydride, and lithium-ion technologies", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "20", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "Apr 1995", "inspec": "4976858", "date": "Apr 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "4", "pages": "20 - 25", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
