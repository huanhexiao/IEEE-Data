Recent advances in computer software and hardware have made simulation easier to apply and use. Users are putting increased reliance on computer simulation in lieu of more expensive test and evaluation. In this paper, a simulation example is given of a complex radar detection problem which is not solvable using conventional procedures. It is shown how this problem is easily solved using a MATLAB simulation on a personal computer (PC)", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "36", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "40", "date_publication": "Apr 1995", "inspec": "4976862", "date": "Apr 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "4", "pages": "36 - 40", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["D.
