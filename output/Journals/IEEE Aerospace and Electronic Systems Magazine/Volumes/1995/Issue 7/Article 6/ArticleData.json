Older flight-control and navigation systems are destined for the surplus market, but new GPSS problems keep appearing. These problems and their solutions were addressed by the nation's top authorities in the Plenary Session of the Institute of Navigation, National Technical Meeting, Anaheim, California (January 1995).
