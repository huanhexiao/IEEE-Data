A formal specification of the current UGC and the new blackboard architecture is also given using the Higher-Order Logic (HOL) Proof System. HOL makes it possible to provide a straightforward, unambiguous and consistent specification of the UGC. The UGC is responsible for monitoring and controlling the switches and rain blowers for the Antenna Microwave Subsystem. The new blackboard architecture for the UGC introduces a collection of parallel processes called knowledge sources. Because of the parallel nature of the blackboard and the ability to retrieve the most current information quickly, there is a gain in efficiency. In addition, the blackboard architecture of the UGC is extensible, which is in keeping with the design philosophy of the UGC", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "12", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "15", "date_publication": "Jul 1995", "inspec": "5069656", "date": "Jul 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "12 - 15", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["S.
