It is shown, that low cost home-made absorbing material with an attenuation of 30 dB or more can be designed. Waveguide and ground plane antennas for test purposes can be constructed from surplus materials. In this case the design and measurements of a 3 GHz antenna pair are shown. Finally, as a test object, a cheap yet effective scale model of a modern fighter aircraft is used for measurements of radar cross section and antenna installations. As a demonstration of the total system capabilities, the measurement of installed F-18 antennas is shown", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "Jul 1995", "inspec": "5069657", "date": "Jul 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "17 - 23", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["P.
