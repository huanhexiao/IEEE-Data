Active sidestick controllers for manual pilot inputs in pitch and roll are examined for commercial transport aircraft. Options and requirements for sidesticks are reviewed. The recommendation of an active sidestick controller is developed providing both cross-cockpit coupling and autopilot backdrive capability. These characteristics provide pilot cues identical to traditional cable-linked column/yoke configurations", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "34", "date_publication": "Jul 1995", "inspec": "5069659", "date": "Jul 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "7", "pages": "31 - 34", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
