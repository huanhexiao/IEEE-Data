These cost effective environments facilitate access to technologies such as VXI, provide speedy development of highly effective user interfaces, and eliminate many of the tasks often associated with hardware integration in complex test systems. Nonetheless, difficulties can arise when designing functional and diagnostic test software in this environment. This paper introduces VISTA, a promising new architecture which allows users to elude most of the difficulties of building detailed functional and diagnostic Test Program Sets (TPSs), while taking full advantage of the benefits of diagrammatic programming environments. Here we examine an implementation of the VISTA architecture, the integration of advanced diagnostics, and the use of diagrammatic programming as a test language cross compiler", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "Mar 1995", "inspec": "4976852", "date": "Mar 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "19 - 28", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["H.
