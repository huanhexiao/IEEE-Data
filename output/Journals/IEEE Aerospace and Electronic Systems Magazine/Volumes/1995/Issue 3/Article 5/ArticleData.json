The task was to land in Category IIIa weather at a Category I facility. Three image parameters were varied: image update rate, image processing latency, and the luminance contrast ratio of the runway image to the background noise. ILS beam bending that was representative of a Category I facility was randomly varied across the experimental runs. Nine pilots completed the test matrix. The only variable that made a significant difference was the runway to background contrast ratio", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "40", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "44", "date_publication": "Mar 1995", "inspec": "4976855", "date": "Mar 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "40 - 44", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["J.
