The C-17 decision is in harmony with the Air Force emphasis on reducing proliferation of unique ATE. The ATE selection was made after consideration of cost, performance and supportability tradeoffs. Minimal augmentation of the government inventoried equipment was required which did not affect the existing hardware and software configuration, This approach significantly reduced C-17 program ATE development costs and afforded the program the use of established logistics elements and support structure. The C-17 program demanded concurrency of support structure and aircraft development-the ATE solution met that demand by reducing risks to a manageable level for both test program set development, and Air Force operation and training requirements", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "29", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "34", "date_publication": "Mar 1995", "inspec": "4976853", "date": "Mar 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "29 - 34", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["F.
