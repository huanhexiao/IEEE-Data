This paper describes an experiment which provides a glimpse of future automation. The experiment combines precision surface radar, high-accuracy differential GPS (DGPS) position determination, automatic dependent surveillance (ADS), and ground and airborne automation systems able to intercommunicate via a VHF data link. In particular, this paper describes the air/ground communications provided by the VHF Data Link. Two classes of messages are processed: continual and ad hoc. The former include DGPS corrections, ADS messages and target data. The latter include graphical taxi clearances and hold bar set-reset information. The work described in this paper is the result of a cooperative venture among NASA, Westinghouse-Norden Systems and ARINC", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "13", "date_publication": "Mar 1995", "inspec": "4976850", "date": "Mar 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "3", "pages": "9 - 13", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
