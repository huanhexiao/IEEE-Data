There are as many definitions of information engineering as there are practitioners of the techniques. This paper addresses information engineering from a practical perspective; it discusses how information engineering techniques can be applied to the real-life problem of identifying system requirements and satisfying those requirements with a computer-based information system. The paper also shows that information engineering, rather than being a new methodology, is made up of components of existing methodologies", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "32", "date_publication": "Sep 1995", "inspec": "5069673", "date": "Sep 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "27 - 32", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
