When within one-half mile of a selected target, the set could be switched to the gun aim mode for accurate aim-and-fire of the six 50-caliber aircraft guns. The design, installation and protection of this radar are described", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "33", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "40", "date_publication": "Sep 1995", "inspec": "5069674", "date": "Sep 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "33 - 40", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["F.
