Time sharing of RF modules between Radar, EW and CNI offers savings. The Air Forces' PAVE PACE program defined the benefits and initial architecture approaches. From this, an optimum Integrated Sensor System (ISS) design was defined that reduces the life cycle cost of the fleet of vehicles using the common modules. The ISS program will design, build and test modules to prove the approach. Challenges to overcome include system complexity, real time control, test and calibration, and diagnostics. The most stressing requirements were determined by analyzing requirements for Radar, EW and CNI. Open interface specifications and module partitioning were developed that can meet all the requirements", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "17", "date_publication": "Sep 1995", "inspec": "5069670", "date": "Sep 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "11 - 17", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["B.
