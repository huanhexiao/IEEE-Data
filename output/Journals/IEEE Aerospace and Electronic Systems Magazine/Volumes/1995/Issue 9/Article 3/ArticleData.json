The application of this policy to modeling and simulation has resulted in the concept of \u201cThe Joint Modeling and Simulation System (J-MASS) Marketplace.\u201d J-MASS is designed as an Open Systems Architecture with the capability for the Simulation Support Environment (SSE) to be expanded by the addition of site specific software. In the \u201cJ-MASS Marketplace\u201d industry will build commercial tools to work with J-MASS and individual organizations will license what they need for their particular site. The J-MASS SSE is a framework or backplane into which everything else plugs. A J-MASS product release would have the core capabilities, but the unique needs of various organizations would be satisfied by industry. This paper addresses how the J-MASS Marketplace could work and how compliance can be defined. It will outline opportunities for industry in both building software for the Marketplace and in defining the Marketplace concept", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "Sep 1995", "inspec": "5069672", "date": "Sep 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "23 - 26", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["W.
