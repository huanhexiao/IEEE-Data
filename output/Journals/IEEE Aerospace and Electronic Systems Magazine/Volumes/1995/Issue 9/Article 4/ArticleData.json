The Naval Air Systems Command (Nav Air) led Advanced Avionics Architecture and Technology Review team of 1992, followed by the multiservice Avionics Engineering SubBoard (AESB) implementation phase team are two examples. The Perry memo and formation of the Open Systems Joint Task Force (OS-JTF) are further evidence of the importance placed on open systems at the DoD level. This paper summarizes these activities and their importance. Examples of the savings that can be expected by application of open systems are presented. Finally, significant on-going work along with critical technologies and concepts that need to be matured to make open systems successful are discussed", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "Sep 1995", "inspec": "5069671", "date": "Sep 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "9", "pages": "18 - 22", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
