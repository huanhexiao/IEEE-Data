This paper gives a summary of the investigation into standardising certain graphical MMI elements, and operator input device elements for tactical command and control systems. This standardisation allows for rapid prototyping on low-cost platforms, as well as enabling the code to be transferred easily between different operating platforms", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "40", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "44", "date_publication": "Jun 1995", "inspec": "5007617", "date": "Jun 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "40 - 44", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
