As a means of doing this, the programs of the Power Sources Division of the Army Research Laboratory are discussed. In carrying out these programs, the personnel of the Power Sources Division work closely with the Battery Management Office of the Army Materiel Command, which is located in the Logistics and Readiness Directorate of the Communication-Electronics Command (CECOM). We are also closely integrated with the Army Research Office, and the fuel cell personnel of the CECOM Research Development and Engineering Center (RDEC), and the battery personnel of the RDECs for the Tank and Automotive Command and the Missile Command. The six program areas discussed in which the Power Sources Division is engaged are: primary batteries, rechargeable batteries, reserve/fuze batteries, pulse batteries and capacitors, fuel cells, and thermophotovoltaic power generation", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "30", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "33", "date_publication": "Jun 1995", "inspec": "5007615", "date": "Jun 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "30 - 33", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
