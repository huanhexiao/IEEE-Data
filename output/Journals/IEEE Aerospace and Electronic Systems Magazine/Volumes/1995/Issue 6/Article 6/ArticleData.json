Given a minimal safety distance to be maintained between two aircraft, we derive a criterion that must be obeyed by their radar plots in order to meet the required separation at a known level of confidence. Conversely, given that a minimal safety distance is maintained between two radar plots, one can find the actual separation that can be guaranteed between both aircraft. The results described here can help to implement automated conflict alert and minimum safe altitude warning facilities", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "24", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "Jun 1995", "inspec": "5007614", "date": "Jun 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "24 - 29", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
