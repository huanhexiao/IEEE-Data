In other words, we are talking about a typical emerging technology. Many organizations are actively pursuing product development based on Stirling machine technology. Stirling machines offer significant performance advantages, but many obstacles remain to be fully resolved, including cost and demonstrated reliability. This article describes the technology upon which Stirling machines are based. Several application areas are then explored, including hot air engines, remote power, solar thermal power, sensor cooling, refrigeration, cogeneration and air-independent propulsion", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "34", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "39", "date_publication": "Jun 1995", "inspec": "5007616", "date": "Jun 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "6", "pages": "34 - 39", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["B.
