Even in the presence of Selective Availability, the accuracy of GPS is sufficient to guide aircraft point-to-point between airports without requiring other navigation aids such as VOR or DME. Unfortunately, there is a finite probability that a GPS satellite will fail, causing the transmission of potentially misleading navigation information. Thus, before GPS can be widely adopted as a navigation aid, techniques must be devised to detect any possible failures and notify the user prior to the degradation of navigation accuracy. This paper discusses the problem of detecting possible GPS satellite failures using a technique called Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM)", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "34", "date_publication": "Oct 1995", "inspec": "5109799", "date": "Oct 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "31 - 34", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["W.
