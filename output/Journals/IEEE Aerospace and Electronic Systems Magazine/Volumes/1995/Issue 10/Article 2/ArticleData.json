Two other systems introduced in this paper are Cockpit Display of Traffic Information (CDTI) and Traffic Advisory and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). All these systems will use navigational signals emitted by the Global Positioning System (GPS) constellation of satellites", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "8", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "14", "date_publication": "Oct 1995", "inspec": "5109796", "date": "Oct 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "8 - 14", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["G.
