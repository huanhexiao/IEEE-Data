The United States SIR-C operated at L- and C-band, each with multiple polarization, utilizing an active phased array antenna. The German/Italian X-SAR operated at X-band with a single polarization. SIR-C and X-SAR operated synchronously to collect data over common sites. Data were collected for repeat-track interferometric processing at all three frequencies. A total of 143 hours (93 terabits) of SAR data were digitally recorded on tape over the two flights for subsequent processing in the U.S., Germany, and Italy. This advanced multifrequency/multipolarization system has produced a rich radar data set for Earth scientific investigation and demonstration of spaceborne radar remote sensing capabilities", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "Oct 1995", "inspec": "5109797", "date": "Oct 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "15 - 24", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["F.
