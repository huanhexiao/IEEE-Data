It discusses the factors which enter into the choice of frequency, and the selection of the transmitter, antenna, and receiver. Reviewed are signal processing issues concerning detection of UWB signals in noise and clutter, nondoppler MTI based on the pulse-to-pulse change in range due to target motion, measurement of target height based on multipath time delay, and target recognition. As the investigation progressed, the authors became disappointed with the available UWB technology, but encouraged about the potential advantages of UWB for this application. The chief limitation of UWB radar that must be overcome before applications are viable is its poor electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "Oct 1995", "inspec": "5109798", "date": "Oct 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "25 - 30", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
