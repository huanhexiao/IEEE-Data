It is clear from this description that the effective slowing of these clocks has no effect on time itself, but only upon the instrumentation or processes by which we choose to measure time. The full paper detailed an experiment which would show that it is indeed only the clocks which slow, and that time remains unaffected", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "2", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "5", "date_publication": "Oct 1995", "inspec": "5109795", "date": "Oct 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "2 - 5", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
