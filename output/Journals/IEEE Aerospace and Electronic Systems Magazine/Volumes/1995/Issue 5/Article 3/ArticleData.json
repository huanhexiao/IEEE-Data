This coincided with a reorganization of LaRC to provide a more concentrated focus on technology transfer to both aerospace and non-aerospace industry. Use of WWW and NCSA Mosaic not only provides automated information dissemination, but also allows for the implementation, evolution and integration of many technology transfer and technology awareness applications. This paper describes several of these innovative applications, including the on-line presentation of the entire Technology Opportunities Showcase (TOPS), an industrial partnering showcase that exists on the Web long after the actual 3-day event ended. The NASA Technical Report Server (NTRS) provides uniform access to many logically similar, yet physically distributed NASA report servers. WWW is also the foundation of the Langley Software Server (LSS), an experimental software distribution system which will distribute LaRC-developed software. In addition to the more formal technology distribution projects, WWW has been successful in connecting people with technologies and people with other people", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "7", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "13", "date_publication": "May 1995", "inspec": "4976864", "date": "May 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "7 - 13", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["M.
