The United States Navy and Air Force developed separate systems during their respective INS developments. The Navy contracted with Litton industries to produce the LTN-72 and Air Force contracted with Delco to produce the Carousel IV INS for the large cargo and specialty aircraft applications, over the years, a total of eight different battery national stock numbers (NSNs) have entered the stock system along with 75 battery spare part NSNs. The standard hardware acquisition and reliability program is working with the Aircraft Battery Group at Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division, Naval Air Systems Command (AIR 536), Wright Laboratory, Battelle Memorial Institute, and Concorde Battery Corporation to produce a standard INS battery. This paper discusses the approach taken to determine whether the battery should be replaced and to select the replacement chemistry. The paper also discusses the battery requirements, aircraft that the battery is compatible with, and status of Navy flight evaluation. Projected savings in avoided maintenance in Navy and Air Force INS systems is projected to be $14.7 million per year with a manpower reduction of 153 maintenance personnel. The new INS battery is compatible with commercially sold INS systems which represents 66% of the systems sold", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "6", "date_publication": "May 1995", "inspec": "4976863", "date": "May 1995", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "5", "pages": "3 - 6", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["W.
