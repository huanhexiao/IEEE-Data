These include alloys that show higher efficiencies and therefore lower hydrogen evolution, low-cost air cathodes that can be fabricated in production quantities, and methods for handling the aluminum hydroxide reaction product. Emphasis is placed on the advances in air cathodes. The application of this technology to new products and the implications for electric vehicles are discussed", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "14", "date_publication": "Oct 1991", "inspec": "4079615", "date": "Oct 1991", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "10", "pages": "11 - 14", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["R.
