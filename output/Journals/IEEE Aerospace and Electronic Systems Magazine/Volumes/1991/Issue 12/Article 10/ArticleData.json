Areas that require new and innovative solutions are prime power, batteries, capacitors, switches, and pulser integration. It is concluded that orders of magnitude improvements are needed; technical barriers exist that require invention; power technology needs to be given a high priority in the tech base strategy; and resources must be rejuvenated and expanded to accomplish the required objectives", "journal_title": "IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Magazine", "firstpage": "21", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "Dec 1991", "inspec": "4124581", "date": "Dec 1991", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2002", "issue": "12", "pages": "21 - 25", "issn": "0885-8985"}, "authors": ["C.
