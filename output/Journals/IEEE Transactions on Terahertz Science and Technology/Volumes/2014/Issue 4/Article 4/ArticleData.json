Using a rigorous one-dimensional electromagnetic model for terahertz propagation in a multi-layered medium combined with a numerical fitting method, the refractive index, extinction coefficient, and thickness of individual paint layers were determined. This proposed method was shown to be able to resolve coating layers down to a thickness of 18 \u03bcm and was validated for both single- and multi-layer automobile paint samples. Results of the terahertz measurements were benchmarked against other techniques that are currently used for non-destructive testing during car manufacture: ultrasound and eddy current measurements, as well as two reference techniques, X-ray microcomputed tomography and surface profilometry. Good consistency was found between the techniques. Compared to conventional techniques, TPI has the advantage that it is a non-contact method and that it is able to spatially resolve the thickness uniformity distribution information by two-dimensional mapping.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "432", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "439", "date_publication": "Fri Jun 06 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14416043", "date": "July 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Jun 26 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "4", "pages": "432 - 439", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Ke Su", "Yao-Chun Shen", "J.
