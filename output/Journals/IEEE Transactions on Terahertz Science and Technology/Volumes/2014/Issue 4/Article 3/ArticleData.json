The thickness and stability of the water film is accurately measured by an optical intensity cross-correlator, and the standard deviation of the film thickness is less than 500 nm. The cross section of the water film is found to have a biconcave cylindrical lens shape. By transmitting through such a thin film, we perform the first ultrabroadband (0.2-30 THz) THz-TDS across the strongest absorbing part of the infrared spectrum of liquid water using two different THz-TDS setups. The extracted absorption coefficient and refractive index of water are in agreement with previous results reported in the literature. With this we show that the thin free-flowing liquid film is a versatile tool for windowless, ultrabroadband THz-TDS with sub-100-femtosecond time resolution of aqueous solutions in transmission mode in the important cross-over region between vibrational and relaxational dynamics.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "425", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "431", "date_publication": "Thu May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14416042", "date": "July 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Jun 26 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "4", "pages": "425 - 431", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Tianwu Wang", "Pernille Klarskov", "Peter Uhd Jepsen"], "keywords": ["absorption coefficients", "infrared spectra", "jets", "liquid films", "optical correlation", "refractive index", "terahertz spectroscopy", "terahertz wave spectra", "thickness measurement", "water", "absorption coefficient extraction", "aqueous solutions", "biconcave cylindrical lens shape", "free flowing water film", "frequency 0.2 THz to 30 THz", "gravity driven wire guided flow jet", "infrared spectrum", "liquid water", "optical intensity crosscorrelator", "refractive index extraction", "relaxational dynamics", "size 17 mum", "standard deviation", "transmission mode", "ultrabroadband THz time-domain spectroscopy", "ultrabroadband THz-TDS", "vibrational dynamics", "water film stability measurement", "water film thickness measurement", "Absorption", "Electron tubes", "Lenses", "Liquids", "Particle beams", "Spectroscopy", "Ultrafast optics", "Air plasma", "THz spectroscopy", "photoconductive antenna", "ultrafast nonlinear optics", "water hydrogen bond network", ""], "arnumber": "6822656"}
