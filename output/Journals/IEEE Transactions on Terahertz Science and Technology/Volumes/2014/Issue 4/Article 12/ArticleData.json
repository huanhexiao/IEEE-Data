The results are compared with conventional THz photomixers without fingers (or bare gap) and with rectangular fingers. The new design is employed as an emitter as well as a detector and much improved THz power and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) are obtained. As compared to the antenna with the bare gap and the antenna with rectangular finger tips under the same condition for the optical power and bias voltage, the new photomixer shows seven and two times power enhancement in the emission side, respectively, while in the detection side, it gives a better SNR of 15 and 10 dB, respectively.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "501", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "508", "date_publication": "Tue May 13 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14400851", "date": "July 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Jun 26 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "4", "pages": "501 - 508", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Neda Khiabani", "Yi Huang", "L.
