The proposed method is based on using open-ended waveguide probes along with on-wafer waveguide transitions to measure the S-parameters of waveguide based components and devices. To enable non-contact measurements, an RF choke is designed and machined on the metallic cross section of the probes using electric discharge machining. Additionally, to enhance the accuracy and repeatability of the measurements, a probe aligner is micromachined over the on-wafer transition. In order to validate the measurement concept, a full-band transition operating at J-band (220-325 GHz) is designed and tested. To achieve high accuracy, the fabrication of the on-wafer waveguide and the transition is performed using silicon micromachining. It is shown that the designed back-to-back transition has a return loss of better than 15 dB and an insertion loss of less than 0.2 dB over the entire frequency band. The measurement results of the fabricated transition also show a good agreement with the simulated results.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "515", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "522", "date_publication": "Tue Jun 17 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14416036", "date": "July 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Jun 26 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "4", "pages": "515 - 522", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Armin Jam", "Meysam Moallem", "Jack East", "Kamal Sarabandi"], "keywords": ["S-parameters", "electron beam machining", "micromachining", "submillimetre wave devices", "submillimetre wave measurement", "terahertz wave devices", "waveguide components", "waveguide transitions", "J-band", "RF choke", "back-to-back transition", "electric discharge machining", "frequency 220 GHz to 325 GHz", "full-band transition", "metallic cross section", "noncontact waveguide probe", "on-wafer S-parameter measurement method", "on-wafer waveguide transitions", "open-ended waveguide probes", "probe aligner", "silicon micromachining", "submillimeter-wave frequency range", "terahertz band", "terahertz frequency range", "waveguide based components", "waveguide based devices", "Inductors", "Probes", "Rectangular waveguides", "Silicon", "Waveguide components", "Waveguide transitions", "E-plane transition", "multi-step silicon micromachining", "on-wafer probe alignment", "waveguide choke", "waveguide probe", ""], "arnumber": "6837511"}
