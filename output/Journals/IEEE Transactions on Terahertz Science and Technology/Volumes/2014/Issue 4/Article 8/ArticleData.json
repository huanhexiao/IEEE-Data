Here, the performances of 165 and 183 GHz low-noise amplifier microchips intended for atmospheric water vapor profiling application are reported. The microchips are manufactured in metamorphic high-electron mobility transistor technology having a gate length of 50 nm. The on-wafer measured results show noise figures of 4.4-7.4 dB and 16-25 dB gain at the operating frequencies. In addition, two of the amplifiers were assembled in waveguide packages and the measured results show a gain of 19-20 dB and 7 dB noise figure at both 165 and 183 GHz.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "459", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "468", "date_publication": "Tue Jun 10 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14416035", "date": "July 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Jun 26 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "4", "pages": "459 - 468", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Mikko K\u00e4rkk\u00e4inen", "Mikko Kantanen", "Sylvain Caujolle-Bert", "Mikko Varonen", "Rainer Weber", "Arnulf Leuther", "Matthias Seelmann-Eggebert", "Ari Alanne", "Petri Jukkala", "Tapani N\u00e4rhi", "Kari A.
