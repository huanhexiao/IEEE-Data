In the proposed algorithm, an appropriate decomposition of the phase-shift operator was performed and a fast algorithm based on FFT was introduced to solve the integral transformation which is the most time-consuming step in the conventional phase-shift migration. The analytical expression of the reconstructed 3-D point-spread function (PSF) was derived based on the EPSM-IR algorithm. The reduction of the computation cost was evaluated quantitatively as compared with the conventional phase-shift migration. Simulation results with fairly good agreement were given to verify the proposed algorithm. Finally, a monostatic prototype imager with a Gaussian beam transceiver was designed for the proof-of-principle experiments in the 0.2-THz band. The 3-D image results of a target with metal strips and a mannequin with concealed threat objects were given to demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the 3-D EPSM-IR algorithm.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "479", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "489", "date_publication": "Mon Jun 09 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14416038", "date": "July 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Jun 26 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "4", "pages": "479 - 489", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Zhaoyang Sun", "Chao Li", "Shengming Gu", "Guangyou Fang"], "keywords": ["holography", "image reconstruction", "optical transfer function", "terahertz wave imaging", "3D THz holographic imaging", "EPSM-IR algorithm", "FFT", "Gaussian beam transceiver", "PSF", "computation efficiency", "concealed threat objects", "enhanced phase-shift migration", "enhanced phase-shift migration-based image reconstruction algorithm", "fast three-dimensional image reconstruction", "frequency 0.2 THz", "integral transformation", "mannequin", "metal strips", "reconstructed 3D point-spread function", "terahertz Gaussian beam illumination", "three-dimensional terahertz holographic imaging", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Approximation methods", "Bandwidth", "Image reconstruction", "Image resolution", "Imaging", "Lighting", "Fast method", "phase-shift migration", "terahertz (THz) imaging", "three-dimensional (3-D) holography", ""], "arnumber": "6827951"}
