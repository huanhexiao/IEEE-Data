Highly doped silicon surfaces are anisotropically etched to form a one-dimensional array of subwavelength concave pyramidal troughs. The plasmonic wave guides are found to support highly confined guided modes both in transverse and longitudinal directions. The resonant frequencies of the modes can be controlled by adjusting the geometrical parameters of the troughs. The existence of guided modes in plasmonic wave guides is also established through finite-element-based numerical simulations. These wave guides could provide a silicon-based alternative to metallic wave guides for use in future THz devices.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "454", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "458", "date_publication": "Tue Jun 10 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14400850", "date": "July 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Jun 26 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "4", "pages": "454 - 458", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Shanshan Li", "Mohammad M.
