The results of the introduced circuit model, which is a fully analytical model with explicit expressions, are in almost complete agreement with the full-wave simulations. Thanks to this analytical model, we can employ standard binomial matching transformer in order to minimize the reflected power from the structure at a desired frequency. Furthermore, taking advantage of this model, we design an optimized tri-layer structure by seeking for a high optical transmittance at the desired frequency and over a wide bandwidth. The obtained transparent electrode has a high power transmission (more than 85%) within a wide frequency range (48% of the central frequency) which is desirable in commonly used transparent electrodes. The square holes are perforated in thick metallic slabs which drastically reduce the electrical resistance of the structure.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "383", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "390", "date_publication": "Mon Apr 14 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14267054", "date": "May 2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 29 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "3", "pages": "383 - 390", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Ghazaleh Kafaie Shirmanesh", "Elahe Yarmoghaddam", "Amin Khavasi", "Khashayar Mehrany"], "keywords": ["electrodes", "optical metamaterials", "terahertz metamaterials", "THz transparent electrode design", "analytical circuit model", "binomial matching transformer", "explicit expressions", "full-wave simulations", "fully analytical model", "high optical transmittance", "homogeneous substrate", "low electrical resistance", "metallic square holes", "metamaterials", "optimized tri-layer structure", "simultaneous terahertz transparency", "thick metallic slabs", "two-dimensional arrays", "Admittance", "Analytical models", "Electrodes", "Integrated circuit modeling", "Power transmission", "Silicon compounds", "Substrates", "Circuit model", "metamaterial", "transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs)", ""], "arnumber": "6797981"}
