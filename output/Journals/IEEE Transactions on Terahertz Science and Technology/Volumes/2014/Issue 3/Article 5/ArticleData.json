Wireless links using emerging terahertz technologies, also referred to as T-ray communications, have become an intensive research field within last years since T-rays at the millimeter/submillimeter frontier remain more robust in terms of scintillation, dielectric obstacles, and fog compared with near-infrared signals. Using a passive THz hot-spot which can be fed by fiber optic networks, we investigate up bit rates up to 46 Gbps for a THz wireless transmission system at 400-GHz carrier frequency. Using a THz photomixer integrated with a specific broadband antenna and heterodyne electronic detection, we investigate the eye diagrams using 1-\u03bcW received power, highlighting the high sensitivity and ultra-wideband behavior of the whole THz system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "328", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "337", "date_publication": "Mon Mar 17 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14267051", "date": "May 2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 29 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "3", "pages": "328 - 337", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Guillaume Ducournau", "Pascal Szriftgiser", "Alexandre Beck", "Denis Bacquet", "Fabio Pavanello", "Emilien Peytavit", "Mohammed Zaknoune", "Tahsin Akalin", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lampin"], "keywords": ["heterodyne detection", "microwave antennas", "mobile radio", "optical fibre networks", "optical links", "photodiodes", "radio links", "terahertz wave devices", "ultra wideband antennas", "ultra wideband communication", "T-ray communication", "THz photomixer", "THz wireless transmission system", "bit rate 46 Gbit/s", "broadband antenna", "broadband quasi-optic photomixer", "coherent detection", "data capacity", "dielectric obstacle", "eye diagrams", "fiber optic networks", "fog", "free space communication", "frequency 0.4 THz", "heterodyne electronic detection", "mobile access", "network technology convergence", "passive THz hot spot", "scintillation", "submillimeter frontier", "terahertz technology", "ultra wideband behavior", "ultrawide bandwidth single channel", "wireless link", "Bandwidth", "Broadband antennas", "Broadband communication", "Optical fiber communication", "Photonics", "Receivers", "Wireless communication", "Photomixers", "terahertz (THz) communications", "unitraveling carrier photo-diode (UTC-PD)", ""], "arnumber": "6774486"}
