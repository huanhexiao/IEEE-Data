The polarizers achieve high extinction ratios (at least 60 dB) with a single layer, while maintaining low insertion loss (a few decibels) by taking advantage of previously under-utilized \u201cspoof\u201d surface-plasmon effects. Full-wave finite-element simulations done with High Frequency Structure Simulator and experiments both show that metal fill-factors upwards of 90% greatly improve polarizer extinction ratio. The extinction ratio of high fill-factor polarizers exceeds that of a commercial free-standing wire grid by up to 20 dB at normal incidence.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "376", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "382", "date_publication": "Fri Apr 11 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14267055", "date": "May 2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 29 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "3", "pages": "376 - 382", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["John R.
