The coded aperture was implemented using programmable illumination from a commercially available digital light processing projector. At 590 GHz, each of the array element apertures can be optically turned on and off with a modulation depth of 20 dB and a modulation rate of ~ 1.3 kHz. Prototype demonstrations of 4 \u00d74 coded-aperture imaging using Hadamard coding have been performed. Continuous THz imaging with 8 \u00d78 pixels has also been demonstrated, using a slowly moving metal strip as the target. In addition, this technique has been successfully applied to mapping THz beams by using a 6 \u00d76 aperture array at 590 GHz. The imaging results agree closely with theoretical calculations based on Gaussian beam propagation, demonstrating that this technique is promising for realizing real-time and low-cost terahertz cameras for many applications. The reported approach provides a simple but powerful means to visualize THz beams, which is highly desired in quasi-optical system alignment, quantum-cascade laser design and characterization, and THz antenna characterization.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "321", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "327", "date_publication": "Tue Mar 11 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14267056", "date": "May 2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 29 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "3", "pages": "321 - 327", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["A.
