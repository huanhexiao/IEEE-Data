This is achieved by splitting a transmitted beam into two beams pointing towards different positions in the target plane. For near-video imaging frame rates, arrays of transceivers would be needed. Both techniques, time-delay multiplexing and the use of transceiver arrays, can be combined to achieve the fastest possible imaging speeds. In this contribution, the feasibility of using the multiplexing technique applied to linear arrays of transceivers is studied. A completely optical multiplexing system, that can work for relatively large arrays, is presented. The technique is demonstrated with measurements in a two-element array.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "232", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "239", "date_publication": "Fri Jan 10 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14145730", "date": "March 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Mar 07 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "2", "pages": "232 - 239", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Beatriz Bl\u00e1zquez", "Ken B.
