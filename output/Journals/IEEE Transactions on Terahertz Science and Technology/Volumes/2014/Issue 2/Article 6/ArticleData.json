This unexpected behavior has been exhaustively investigated theoretically and by full-wave finite-element electromagnetic simulations. After ruling out fabrication and assembly defaults in several RF path components, the best explanation for the cross-polarization degradation at certain frequencies is provided by the effect of the cryostat infrared filters on the corrugated horn. The theoretical expressions derived in this analysis match all measurement results satisfactorily.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "184", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "192", "date_publication": "Fri Jan 24 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14145735", "date": "March 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Mar 07 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "2", "pages": "184 - 192", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Alvaro Gonzalez", "Yoshinori Uzawa"], "keywords": ["assembling", "cryostats", "electromagnetic wave polarisation", "filters", "finite element analysis", "millimetre wave receivers", "submillimetre wave receivers", "ALMA band-4 frequency-dependent cross-polarization", "Atacama large millimeter-submillimeter array", "RF path component", "assembly", "band-4 receiver", "corrugated horn", "cryostat infrared filter", "full-wave finite-element electromagnetic simulation", "Apertures", "Assembly", "Dielectrics", "Extraterrestrial measurements", "Frequency measurement", "Receivers", "Transducers", "Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA)", "cross polarization", "electromagnetic analysis", "millimeter-wave technology", ""], "arnumber": "6722989"}
