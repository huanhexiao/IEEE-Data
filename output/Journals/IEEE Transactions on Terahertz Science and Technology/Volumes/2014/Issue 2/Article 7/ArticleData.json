Specifically, the miniaturized three-section hybrid chip fabricated using thin-film technology utilizes superconducting Niobium (Nb) transmission lines, air bridges to connect the fingers of the Lange coupler (middle section), and is complemented with two bias-T circuits with integrated MIM capacitors. The assembly was designed to ensure amplitude and phase imbalances better than 0.6 dB and \u00b12\u00b0, respectively. Experimental verification of the assembly at 4 K shows good agreement between the measurements and simulations with amplitude imbalance of 0.5 dB and maximum phase imbalance of \u00b12\u00b0. The ALMA band-5 (163-211 GHz) receiver will include such assembly. The receiver tests shows sideband rejection ratio better than 15 dB over the entire RF band, i.e., a systematic improvement of 3-9 dB as compared with the previously reported results.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "193", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "200", "date_publication": "Thu Jan 09 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14145723", "date": "March 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Mar 07 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "2", "pages": "193 - 200", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Hawal Rashid", "Denis Meledin", "Vincent Desmaris", "Alexey Pavolotsky", "Victor Belitsky"], "keywords": ["MIM devices", "cryogenic electronics", "niobium", "submillimetre wave receivers", "superconducting transmission lines", "superconductor-insulator-superconductor mixers", "thin film devices", "waveguide couplers", "ALMA band-5 receiver", "IF assembly", "Lange coupler", "SIS mixers", "air bridges", "amplitude imbalance", "bias-T circuits", "compact hybrid chip", "coupled line coupler", "cryogenic THz receivers", "frequency 163 GHz to 211 GHz", "frequency 4 GHz to 8 GHz", "integrated MIM capacitors", "intermediate frequency assembly", "phase imbalance", "receiver tests", "sideband rejection ratio", "superconducting Niobium transmission lines", "superconducting hybrid assembly", "superconductor-insulator-superconductor mixers", "temperature 4 K", "thin-film technology", "three-section hybrid chip", "transmission-line circuits", "Amplitude modulation", "Assembly", "Calibration", "Couplers", "Couplings", "Receivers", "Superconducting microwave devices", "2SB receiver", "Directional coupler", "microwave components", "super conducting devices", "thin-film circuits", ""], "arnumber": "6702513"}
