A test device consisting of series array of 68 Nb/Al-AlOx/Nb tunnel junctions was designed to study generation of the second harmonic in the 190-210 GHz band. The SIS array was exited with microwave radiation at 3-mm band using a quasi-optically coupled Gunn oscillator, and the output response of the device was studied using a double-sideband SIS mixer operating in the 163-211 GHz range with 4-8 GHz IF bandwidth. We measured extremely sharp spectral signals, associated with the \u00d72 frequency multiplication by the SIS array. Single- and multi-photon processes were observed in the response of SIS tunnel junction-array to the applied microwave radiation, confirming device operation in the quantum mode. The output power of the multiplied signal increases linearly with the power of the pumping signal up to certain level and them saturates. In attempt to verify that the device produces noticeable power, the output of the test device was connected to the LO port of the SIS mixer, and an increase of 10%-20% in the SIS mixer dark current was observed. Further development of the demonstrated principle of frequency multiplication may lead to a practical frequency multiplier device.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "254", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "259", "date_publication": "Mon Feb 17 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14145733", "date": "March 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Mar 07 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "2", "pages": "254 - 259", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Bhushan Billade", "Alexey Pavolotsky", "Victor Belitsky"], "keywords": ["Gunn oscillators", "frequency multipliers", "superconductor-insulator-superconductor mixers", "LO port", "SIS mixer dark current", "SIS tunnel junction-array response", "bandwidth 4 GHz to 8 GHz", "distributed array", "double-sideband SIS mixer", "extremely-sharp spectral signals", "frequency 163 GHz to 211 GHz", "frequency multiplication", "frequency multiplier device", "microwave radiation", "multiphoton process", "off-chip detection", "pumping signal", "quantum mode", "quasioptically-coupled Gunn oscillator", "single-photon process", "superconductor-insulator-superconductor junctions", "test device output", "tunnel junction series array", "Arrays", "Harmonic analysis", "Junctions", "Mixers", "Oscillators", "Power generation", "Frequency multiplier", "superconducting devices", "thin-film circuits", ""], "arnumber": "6742632"}
