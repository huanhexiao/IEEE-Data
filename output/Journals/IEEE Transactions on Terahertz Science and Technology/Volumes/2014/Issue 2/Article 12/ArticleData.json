Time-reversed convolutional perfectly matching layers (CPML) were implemented as boundaries to truncate the simulation domain. The proposed computationally efficient technique is capable of producing detailed images using a much smaller set of measured data compared to conventional terahertz imaging methods. A coarser grid of transmitter/receiver locations is needed, saving significant data acquisition time. Transmission and reflection imaging configurations in far-field were investigated. Simulations as well as experimental results, including comparisons with conventional methods, are presented. Our approach was validated experimentally using a time-domain terahertz measurement system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "240", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "246", "date_publication": "Mon Feb 17 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14145729", "date": "March 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Mar 07 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "2", "pages": "240 - 246", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Cemile Bardak", "Yanhan Zhu", "Ayrton A.
