It consists of five 350- \u03bcm-thick Si wafers, each spaced 1 mm apart. The thermal emission of this structure was calculated analytically and numerically. A comprehensive study was performed that included analyzing the oblique incidence, polarization, and design tolerance effects. The thermal emission was calculated using both Kirchhoff's law and directly using a Green's function method. It was measured using a Michelson interferometer. The predicted and measured thermal emission spectra had peaks around 150 GHz apart, with a narrow bandwidth of 50 GHz. The peaks were up to 80% of the expected blackbody levels and the bandgaps had emission levels of about 20% of those blackbody values. We demonstrate that, using these techniques, it is possible to achieve a desired THz thermal emission signature, with narrowband features that can be engineered to have specific angles of emission and polarization states.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "213", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "224", "date_publication": "Wed Jan 29 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14156251", "date": "March 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Mar 07 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "2", "pages": "213 - 224", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Ian A.
