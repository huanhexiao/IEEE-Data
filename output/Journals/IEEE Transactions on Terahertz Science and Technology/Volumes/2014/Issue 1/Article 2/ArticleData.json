To date, about 50 independent empirical studies on living organisms, model systems and cells have been performed to clarify bio-electromagnetic interaction in the THz frequency range. Many of these studies find behavioral effects or effects on the cellular level, even at non-thermal exposure levels, while others do not report effects other than thermally induced damage. We discuss the general challenges in performing reliable field exposure experiments in the THz frequency range and describe a methodology that was adopted in a large campaign searching for genotoxic effects of THz radiation in vitro.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "12", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "Thu Jan 09 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14032956", "date": "Jan. 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "1", "pages": "12 - 25", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Thomas Kleine-Ostmann", "Christian Jastrow", "Kai Baaske", "Bernd Heinen", "Michael Schwerdtfeger", "Uwe K\u00e4rst", "Henning Hintzsche", "Helga Stopper", "Martin Koch", "Thorsten Schrader"], "keywords": ["bioelectric potentials", "biomagnetism", "cellular effects of radiation", "dosimetry", "electromagnetic fields", "genomics", "radiation protection", "terahertz waves", "toxicology", "THz frequency range", "THz radiation", "bioelectromagnetic interaction", "cellular level", "dosimetry", "field exposure", "genotoxic effects", "health protection", "independent empirical studies", "living organisms", "nonionizing electromagnetic fields", "nonthermal exposure levels", "thermally induced damage", "Biology", "Containers", "Density measurement", "Humidity", "Laser beams", "Power system measurements", "Reliability", "Dosimetry of non-ionizing radiation", "THz metrology", "field exposure with sub-mm and Terahertz (THz) radiation", "uncertainty analysis and traceability to the SI units", ""], "arnumber": "6708468"}
