The antenna operates at terahertz frequencies and is composed of a graphene sheet transferred onto a back-metallized substrate and a set of polysilicon DC gating pads located beneath it. In order to create a leaky-mode, the graphene surface reactance is sinusoidally modulated via graphene's field effect by applying adequate DC bias voltages to the different gating pads. The pointing angle and leakage rate can be dynamically controlled by adjusting the applied voltages, providing versatile beamscanning capabilities. The proposed concept and achieved performance, computed using realistic material parameters, are extremely promising for beamscanning at THz frequencies, and could pave the way to graphene-based reconfigurable transceivers and sensors.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "116", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "122", "date_publication": "Thu Jan 09 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14040739", "date": "Jan. 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "1", "pages": "116 - 122", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Marc Esquius-Morote", "Juan Sebastian G\u00f3mez-D\u0131\u00b4az", "Julien Perruisseau-Carrier"], "keywords": ["beam steering", "electric reactance", "elemental semiconductors", "graphene", "leaky wave antennas", "metallisation", "microwave antennas", "radio transceivers", "silicon", "terahertz wave detectors", "DC bias voltage", "Si", "back metallized substrate", "dynamic control", "electronic beam scanning", "graphene field effect", "graphene sheet", "graphene surface reactance", "graphene-based reconfigurable sensor", "graphene-based reconfigurable transceiver", "leakage rate", "leaky mode", "pointing angle", "polysilicon DC gating pads", "sinusoidally modulated graphene leaky wave antenna", "versatile beamscanning capability", "Antennas", "Graphene", "Impedance", "Modulation", "Substrates", "Surface impedance", "Surface waves", "Graphene", "beamscanning", "leaky-wave antennas", "reconfigurability", "sinusoidally modulated surfaces", "terahertz (THz)", ""], "arnumber": "6708495"}
