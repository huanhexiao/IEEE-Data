The database is universally available on the World Wide Web via the Internet since 2008 and was recently restructured on the basis of contemporary HTML5 technology. Flexibility and convenience to browse spectroscopic data are much improved. In the database, no less than 1500 spectroscopic data have been consolidated and provided for various materials under different conditions. Furthermore, a data upload system from general users has been prepared to enrich the database further.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "110", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "115", "date_publication": "Mon Nov 04 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14032954", "date": "Jan. 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "1", "pages": "110 - 115", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Takashi Notake", "Rihei Endo", "Kaori Fukunaga", "Iwao Hosako", "Chiko Otani", "Hiroaki Minamide"], "keywords": ["Internet", "electrical engineering computing", "hypermedia markup languages", "information services", "physics computing", "terahertz spectroscopy", "HTML5 technology", "Internet", "National Institute of Information and Communication Technology", "RIKEN", "World Wide Web", "modern Web technology", "pioneering database", "spectroscopic data", "terahertz spectroscopy database", "Browsers", "Databases", "Educational institutions", "Electronic mail", "Internet", "Spectroscopy", "Database", "spectroscopy", "terahertz (THz)", ""], "arnumber": "6654317"}
