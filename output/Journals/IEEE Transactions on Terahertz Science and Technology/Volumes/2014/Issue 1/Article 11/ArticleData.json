This method is based on a coupled solution of Maxwell and hydrodynamic transport equations. In this manner, a complete description of carrier-wave interactions inside the 2DEG layer is obtained. Particularly, this simulator is employed to investigate the 2-D plasmon variations initiated by the application of an external bias along the hetero-structure. Substantial changes in the plasmon characteristics such as wavelength and decay length are reported. It is also revealed that two symmetrical plasmonic modes along the unbiased 2DEG layer split into new asymmetrical ones after applying the bias voltage. The simulation has been performed in different structures to examine the effects of various electron densities and the presence of periodic metallic gratings on the plasmon properties. Moreover, the 2-D plasmon reflections from boundaries terminated by ohmic contacts are separately studied. This research demonstrates the potentials of the 2-D conductors in the design of novel active terahertz plasmonic devices as modulators and amplifiers while proposing a new approach for their modeling. The results of this simulation are verified independently with an analytical model.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "101", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "109", "date_publication": "Mon Sep 30 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14032952", "date": "Jan. 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "1", "pages": "101 - 109", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Mohammad Ali Khorrami", "Samir El-Ghazaly", "Hameed Naseem", "Shui-Qing Yu"], "keywords": ["Maxwell equations", "microwave amplifiers", "modulators", "ohmic contacts", "plasmonics", "plasmons", "terahertz wave devices", "two-dimensional electron gas", "2-D conductors", "2-D plasmon reflections", "2DEG", "Maxwell equations", "active terahertz plasmonic devices", "amplifiers", "bias voltage", "biased heterostructures", "carrier-wave interactions", "electron densities", "external bias", "full wave numerical technique", "global modeling", "hydrodynamic transport equations", "modulators", "ohmic contacts", "periodic metallic gratings", "propagation properties", "symmetrical plasmonic modes", "terahertz frequencies", "two-dimensional electron gas", "Analytical models", "Conductors", "Equations", "HEMTs", "MODFETs", "Mathematical model", "Plasmons", "Boltzmann transport equation", "Maxwell equations", "global modeling", "plasmonic", "terahertz (THz)", ""], "arnumber": "6616030"}
