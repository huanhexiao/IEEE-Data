The connection repeatability of four types of flange was measured using one-port measurements and a \u201cload-reference\u201d technique with a vertically mounted system to mitigate gravitational bias. To measure the error-corrected complex reflection coefficients of pairs of waveguide flanges, a calibration procedure insensitive to flange misalignment was used. This SDD(RO) calibration method employs four standards: a flush short, two delay shorts with different but unspecified offsets, and a radiating open-ended waveguide. The uncertainty associated with this calibration method is investigated and it is used to estimate the reflection coefficient resulting from flange misalignment.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "39", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "48", "date_publication": "Wed Nov 13 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14032955", "date": "Jan. 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "1", "pages": "39 - 48", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Huilin Li", "Alexander Arsenovic", "Jeffrey L.
