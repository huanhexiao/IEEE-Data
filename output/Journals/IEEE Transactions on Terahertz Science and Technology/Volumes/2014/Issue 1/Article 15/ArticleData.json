Specifically in [1], it is claimed that \u201cit is not possible to calculate accurately the far field radiated by an antenna laying in an interface air-dielectric radiating in a semi-infinite substrate using CST software\u201d. This is a statement which contradicts our experience since we have found in many works that MS CST1 provides accurate results for such configurations. In order to perform simulations of antennas at the interface between two dielectrics, the antenna (dipole or slot) should be placed between an air and a dielectric box which are closed in open boundaries to recreate infinite media. CST discredits the whole volume to compute the fields in this volume. The fields and impedance on either the dipole or slot are then well simulated. Some discrepancies could be found if the thickness of the air box is small in terms of the wavelength and the antenna radiates significant power into the air medium, which is not the case for the antennas studied in [2].", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "127", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "128", "date_publication": "Mon Jan 13 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14055424", "date": "Jan. 2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 20 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "1", "pages": "127 - 128", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Nuria Llombart", "Andrea Neto"], "keywords": ["dielectric properties", "dipole antennas", "numerical analysis", "slot antennas", "CST software", "air medium", "dipole antenna", "far field", "infinite media", "interface air-dielectric", "numerical simulations", "open boundaries", "semiinfinite substrate", "slot antenna", "Antenna measurements", "Dielectrics", "Dipole antennas", "Lenses", "Silicon", "Slot antennas", ""], "arnumber": "6710193"}
