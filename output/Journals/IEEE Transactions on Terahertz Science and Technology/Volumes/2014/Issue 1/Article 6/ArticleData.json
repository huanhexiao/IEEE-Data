A cavity-backed CPW line (CBCBW) is a planar transmission line that is designed and optimized for minimum loss while providing 50- \u03a9 characteristic impedance. This line is shown to provide less than 0.12 dB/mm loss over the entire J-band (220-325 GHz). The transition from CBCPW to waveguide is realized in three steps to achieve a broadband response with a topology amenable to silicon micromachining. The first step is a tapered transition from the CBCPW line to a 50- \u03a9 reduced-height waveguide. The next two steps utilize a novel in-plane impedance tapering technique to transition from the reduced-height waveguide to the on-wafer regular height waveguide. The full transition has less than 0.9 dB of insertion loss and more than 13 dB of return loss over the entire J-band (39% bandwidth). Silicon micromachining technology is used to fabricate prototypes of back-to-back CBCPW line-to-waveguide transitions. A novel waveguide-probe measurement setup is introduced and utilized to evaluate the performance of the transitions and the CBCPW lines.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "49", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "55", "date_publication": "Mon Dec 23 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14032959", "date": "Jan. 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "1", "pages": "49 - 55", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Meysam Moallem", "Jack East", "Kamal Sarabandi"], "keywords": ["coplanar waveguides", "elemental semiconductors", "micromachining", "rectangular waveguides", "silicon", "transmission lines", "waveguide transitions", "CBCBW", "broadband micromachined rectangular waveguide", "cavity-backed coplanar waveguide transition", "frequency 220 GHz to 325 GHz", "in-plane impedance tapering technique", "planar transmission line", "resistance 50 ohm", "silicon micromachining", "waveguide probe measurement setup", "Coplanar waveguides", "Impedance", "Micromachining", "Silicon", "Substrates", "Waveguide transitions", "Cavity-backed coplanar waveguide (CBCPW)", "in-plane impedance taper", "micromachining technology", "multistep transition", "waveguide probe measurement setup", ""], "arnumber": "6692899"}
