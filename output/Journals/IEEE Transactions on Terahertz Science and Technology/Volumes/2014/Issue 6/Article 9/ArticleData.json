Physical optics and ray-tracing methods were used to quantify and separate errors in beam pointing and distortion due to reflector misalignment and primary reflector surface deformations. Simulations were performed concurrently with the manufacturing of a multi-beam demonstrator of the relay optical system which shapes and images the beams to their corresponding receiver feed horns. Results from Monte Carlo simulations show that the inserts used for reflector mounting should be positioned with an overall accuracy better than 100 \u03bcm (~ 1/10 wavelength). Analyses of primary reflector surface deformations show that a deviation of magnitude 100 \u03bcm can be tolerable before deployment, whereas the corresponding variations should be less than 30 \u03bcm during operation. The most sensitive optical elements in terms of misalignments are found near the focal plane. This localized sensitivity is attributed to the off-axis nature of the beams at this location. Post-assembly mechanical measurements of the reflectors in the demonstrator show that alignment better than 50 \u03bcm could be obtained.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "714", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "721", "date_publication": "Tue Oct 14 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14703184", "date": "Nov. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "6", "pages": "714 - 721", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Arvid Hammar", "Mark Whale", "Per Forsberg", "Axel Murk", "Anders Emrich", "Jan Stake"], "keywords": ["Monte Carlo methods", "deformation", "focal planes", "optical elements", "optical receivers", "ray tracing", "tolerance analysis", "Monte Carlo simulation", "focal plane", "localized sensitivity", "multibeam demonstrator", "multibeam limb viewing instrument STEAMR", "off-axis nature", "optical elements", "optical tolerance analysis", "physical optics", "post-assembly mechanical measurements", "primary reflector surface deformations", "ray-tracing methods", "receiver feed horns", "reflector mounting", "relay optical system", "stratosphere-troposphere exchange and climate monitor radiometer", "submillimeter atmospheric multibeam limb sounder", "Adaptive optics", "Integrated optics", "Monte Carlo methods", "Optical distortion", "Optical receivers", "Submillimeter wave devices", "Tolerance analysis", "Limb viewing", "Monte Carlo", "Stratosphere&#x2013", "Troposphere Exchange And climate Monitor Radiometer (STEAMR)", "multi-beam", "quasi-optics", "submillimeter-wave instruments", "tolerance analysis", ""], "arnumber": "6923496"}
