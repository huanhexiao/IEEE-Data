The capabilities of the so-called self-switching diode (SSD) are analyzed for different dimensions of the channel at room temperature. Signal detection up to the 690 GHz limit of the experimental set-up has been achieved at zero bias. The reduction of the channel width increases the detection responsivity, while the reduction in length reduces the responsivity but increases the cut-off frequency. In the case of heterodyne detection an intrinsic bandwidth of at least 100 GHz has been found. The intermediate frequency (IF) power increases for short SSDs, while the optimization in terms of the channel width is a trade-off between a higher non-linearity (obtained for narrow SSDs) and a large current level (obtained for wide SSDs). Moreover, the RF performance can be improved by biasing, with optimum performances reached, as expected, when the DC non-linearity is maximum.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "670", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "677", "date_publication": "Tue Sep 16 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14703195", "date": "Nov. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "6", "pages": "670 - 677", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Ignacio \u00cd\u00f1iguez-de-la-Torre", "Carlos Daher", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millithaler", "J\u00e9r\u00e9mi Torres", "Philippe Nouvel", "Luca Varani", "Paul Sangar\u00e9", "Guillaume Ducournau", "Christophe Gaqui\u00e8re", "Tom\u00e1s Gonz\u00e1lez", "Javier Mateos"], "keywords": ["III-V semiconductors", "Monte Carlo methods", "gallium compounds", "heterodyne detection", "mixers (circuits)", "nanoelectronics", "nanosensors", "semiconductor diodes", "terahertz wave detectors", "wide band gap semiconductors", "DC nonlinearity", "GaN", "GaN planar nanodiodes", "Monte Carlo simulations", "THz detectors", "THz mixers", "broadband terahertz direct detection", "detection responsivity", "geometry optimization", "heterodyne detection", "intermediate frequency power", "intrinsic bandwidth", "output power", "self-switching diode", "signal detection", "temperature 293 K to 298 K", "Detectors", "Gallium nitride", "Mixers", "Monte Carlo methods", "Nanoelectronics", "Performance evaluation", "Radio frequency", "Submillimeter wave technology", "Mixing", "Monte Carlo simulations", "nanoelectronics", "rectification", "terahertz science", ""], "arnumber": "6899712"}
