A THz gas spectrometer with a frequency range of 300-500 GHz was designed and constructed. Proof-of-principle testing was performed at laboratory conditions using mixtures of different gases at high temperatures (600-700 K). The results demonstrate the feasibility of applying strong rotational water vapor lines at 448 and 383 GHz, so as to obtain reliable online measurements of water vapor with an absolute precision of about 0.2 vol.% for the current device. CO lines were identified at 461 and 346 GHz, facilitating measurement of this gas. The gas spectrometer was integrated into an industrial gasifier and boiler, and its performance was tested in terms of online measurements of steam and CO in the hot raw gas and flue gases under real-life conditions. Considering the error intervals, the results are in complete agreement with data acquired by solving loose mass balances around the system. The onsite experiments demonstrate that THz gas spectroscopy is a promising tool for fast, robust, and reliable monitoring in industrial applications.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "722", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "733", "date_publication": "Tue Sep 16 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14703192", "date": "Nov. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "6", "pages": "722 - 733", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Hosein Bidgoli", "Sergey Cherednichenko", "Jens Nordmark", "Henrik Thunman", "Martin Seemann"], "keywords": ["boilers", "carbon compounds", "computerised instrumentation", "fuel gasification", "gas sensors", "steam", "terahertz spectroscopy", "CO", "CO levels", "H<sub>2</sub>O", "THz gas spectrometer", "THz transmission spectroscopy", "boiler", "frequency 300 GHz to 500 GHz", "gas mixtures", "industrial biomass gasifier", "laboratory conditions", "online measurements", "producer gas", "proof-of-principle testing", "raw gas", "real-time monitoring", "steam monitoring", "strong rotational water vapor lines", "temperature 600 K to 700 K", "terahertz spectroscopy", "Absorption", "Biomass", "Gases", "Real-time systems", "Spectroscopy", "Submillimeter wave technology", "Temperature measurement", "Biomass gasification", "THz waves", "carbon monoxide", "real-time measurement", "transmission spectroscopy", "water vapor", ""], "arnumber": "6899710"}
