At room temperature, a double side-band (DSB) mixer noise temperature of 2800 K and a conversion loss of 10.5 dB have been measured at 1134 GHz. When the mixers are cooled down to 120 K, they exhibit DSB noise temperatures as low as about 2000 K and conversion loss of 12 dB. The compact local oscillator source (LO) is based on a x2x3 chain and sufficiently pumps the sub-harmonic mixer with 1.5-2.5 mW of power. The receivers provide around 15% RF bandwidth and are well suited for planetary missions to investigate methane and other key lines.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "661", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "669", "date_publication": "Mon Oct 20 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14703191", "date": "Nov. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "6", "pages": "661 - 669", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Erich Schlecht", "Jose V.
