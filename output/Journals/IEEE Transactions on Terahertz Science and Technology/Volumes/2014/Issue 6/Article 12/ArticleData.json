Compared with the conventional SWSs, the novel SWS has a wider \u201ccold\u201d bandwidth and higher interaction impedance. The Particle-in-cell (PIC) results show that the BWO can produce over 0.82 W output power in the operating frequency range from 0.82 to 1 THz by utilizing an operating voltage range from 5 to 10 kV. The interaction efficiency over the entire operating frequency band is above 2.8%. This SWS, which employing a circular electron beam of 3 mA, can be considered as a promising THz SWS for BWO design with characteristics of moderate operating voltage, wide tunable bandwidth, high efficiency, and compact structure.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "741", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "748", "date_publication": "Mon Oct 13 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14703193", "date": "Nov. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "6", "pages": "741 - 748", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Minghao Zhang", "Yanyu Wei", "Xianbao Shi", "Lingna Yue", "Wanghe Wei", "Jin Xu", "Guoqing Zhao", "Minzhi Huang", "Zhanliang Wang", "Yubin Gong", "Wenxiang Wang", "Dazhi Li"], "keywords": ["backward wave oscillators", "slow wave structures", "terahertz wave devices", "THz band", "circular electron beam", "current 3 mA", "frequency 0.82 THz to 1 THz", "interaction impedance", "modified slow-wave structure", "particle-in-cell results", "power 0.82 W", "quasiparallel-plate", "terahertz backward-wave oscillator BWO design", "voltage 5 kV to 10 kV", "Dispersion", "Electron beams", "Impedance", "Oscillators", "Rectangular waveguides", "Submillimeter wave technology", "Backward-wave oscillator (BWO)", "quasi-parallel-plate (QPP)", "slow-wave structure (SWS)", "terahertz (THz) source", ""], "arnumber": "6920092"}
