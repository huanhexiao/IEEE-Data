High cross-range resolution can be achieved simultaneously with small rotation angles for the tiny wavelength. However, the radar echo should be sampled according to the Nyquist theory and the imaging should ensure that the unambiguous range is large than the size of targets, which limits its application from both data collection and data storage perspectives. In this paper, a bistatic THz radar azimuth-elevation imaging scheme based on compressed sensing is proposed. By exploiting the sparsity of the space distribution in the imaging plane, it is sufficient to reconstruct images of targets with a small number of random measurements within the radar aperture. This means that the limitation for the high resolution THz imaging of large targets can be overcome. The available high resolution bistatic images of targets, which show the target as it is observed, can be very useful for scattering understanding and target recognition at THz frequencies. Simulation results by the electromagnetic calculation data are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "702", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "713", "date_publication": "Mon Sep 01 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14703185", "date": "Nov. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "6", "pages": "702 - 713", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Ruijun Wang", "Bin Deng", "Yuliang Qin", "Hongqiang Wang"], "keywords": ["compressed sensing", "image reconstruction", "radar imaging", "terahertz wave detectors", "bistatic terahertz radar azimuth-elevation imaging", "compressed sensing", "electromagnetic calculation data", "image reconstruction", "radar aperture", "random measurements", "space distribution", "Azimuth", "Bistatic radar", "Compressed sensing", "Image resolution", "Radar imaging", "Submillimeter wave technology", "Terahertz (THz) radar", "azimuth -elevation imaging", "bistatic radar imaging", "block sparse", "compressed sensing", ""], "arnumber": "6889040"}
