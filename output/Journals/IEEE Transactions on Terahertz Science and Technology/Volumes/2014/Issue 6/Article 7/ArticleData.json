Due to its wide tuning range, high frequency resolution, and fast data acquisition the system combines micrometer precision with short measurement time. In addition, the presented system is not limited by the 2\u03c0 uncertainty of previous continuous wave signals and is therefore capable of measuring thick layers. Thus, the presented system and measurement method are a cost effective alternative to THz time-domain systems in the field of thickness measurements.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "696", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "701", "date_publication": "Fri Aug 29 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14703190", "date": "Nov. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "6", "pages": "696 - 701", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Dennis Stanze", "Bj\u00f6rn Globisch", "Roman J.
