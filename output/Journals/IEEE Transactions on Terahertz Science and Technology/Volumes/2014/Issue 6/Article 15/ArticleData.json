We have developed a simple calibration method for the frequency of a THz time-domain spectrometer (TDS) using an optically transparent THz air-gap etalon (OT-TAGE). The OT-TAGE can be used in both the near-infrared (NIR) and THz regions. Therefore, a frequency measurement using THz waves can be directly compared with one using NIR light via the OT-TAGE. In this study, the frequency of a commercial THz-TDS was calibrated by referring to the NIR wavelength was demonstrated. The obtained frequency errors were within \u00b1 3 GHz, with relative uncertainties within 1%.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "756", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "759", "date_publication": "Fri Sep 19 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14703188", "date": "Nov. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "6", "pages": "756 - 759", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Moto Kinoshita", "Hitoshi Iida", "Yozo Shimada"], "keywords": ["calibration", "frequency measurement", "measurement errors", "measurement uncertainty", "terahertz spectroscopy", "THz regions", "frequency calibration", "frequency errors", "frequency measurement", "near-infrared regions", "optically transparent THz air-gap etalon", "terahertz time-domain spectrometer", "uncertainties", "Air gaps", "Calibration", "Frequency measurement", "Interferometers", "Optical variables measurement", "Time-domain analysis", "Uncertainty", "Time-domain analysis", "air gaps", "calibration", "frequency", "interferometers", ""], "arnumber": "6905868"}
