The INBCs have been developed in the past to model efficiently the field penetration through thin conductive shields. Here, INBCs are used to model graphene sheet by an original and simple circuit-oriented FEM model. The efficiency of the method is proven by validation in different test configurations available in litterature. The proposed circuit-oriented FEM model seems to be very suitable to model next generation smart materials using graphene.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "734", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "740", "date_publication": "Wed Oct 15 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14703183", "date": "Nov. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "6", "pages": "734 - 740", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Mauro Feliziani", "Silvano Cruciani", "Francesca Maradei"], "keywords": ["electric impedance", "finite element analysis", "graphene", "multilayers", "sheet materials", "surface conductivity", "C", "circuit-oriented FEM model", "circuit-oriented FEM modeling", "field penetration", "finite element method", "finite extension graphene sheet", "impedance network boundary conditions", "multilayer graphene sheet", "next generation smart materials", "thin conductive shields", "Computational modeling", "Electromagnetic shielding", "Finite element analysis", "Graphene", "Integrated circuit modeling", "Nanotechnology", "Numerical models", "Electromagnetic (EM) field numerical computation", "finite-element method (FEM)", "graphene modeling", "nanotechnology", "shielding", ""], "arnumber": "6924816"}
