The diodes can be characterized based on the mixer operation (conversion loss and noise temperature) under comparable conditions. The tuning of the embedding impedances and the easy changing of the diode under test allow the comparison of different diodes in their actual operating environment. A fundamental mixer test jig and a subharmonic mixer test jig are designed for the characterization and comparison of different single-anode and antiparallel Schottky diodes, respectively, at 183 GHz. For the antiparallel diodes, the traditional capacitance extraction is not possible, thus alternative and additional characterization data is valuable. The diode manufacturers can exploit the mixer-based characterization to test the mixer operation of their diode and to reveal possible problems with the diode during the diode development process.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "552", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "559", "date_publication": "Mon Jun 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14548016", "date": "Sept. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 21 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "5", "pages": "552 - 559", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Krista Dahlberg", "Tero Kiuru", "Juha Mallat", "Tapani N\u00e4rhi", "Antti V.
