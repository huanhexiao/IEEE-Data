First, the characteristics of the graphene are analyzed and a beam reconfigurable antenna is designed. The beamwidth and direction can be controlled by the states of each graphene patch in the antenna. Then the path loss and reflection models of the THz channel are discussed. We combine the graphene-based antenna and the THz channel model, and propose a new MIMO antenna design. The radiation directions of the transmit antennas can be programmed dynamically, leading to different channel state matrices. Finally, the path loss and the channel capacity are numerically calculated and compared with those of the Gigahertz (GHz) channel. The results show that for short range communications, the proposed MIMO antenna design can enlarge the channel capacity by both increasing the number of antennas and choosing the best channel state matrices.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "609", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "617", "date_publication": "Mon Jun 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14548013", "date": "Sept. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 21 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "5", "pages": "609 - 617", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Zheng Xu", "Xiaodai Dong", "Jens Bornemann"], "keywords": ["MIMO communication", "antenna radiation patterns", "channel capacity", "design engineering", "graphene", "matrix algebra", "microstrip antenna arrays", "nanostructured materials", "software radio", "terahertz wave devices", "transmitting antennas", "beam reconfigurable antenna", "channel capacity", "channel state matrices", "graphene nanopatch antennas", "path loss", "radiation directions", "reconfigurable MIMO antenna system", "reconfigurable multiple-input multiple-output antenna system", "reflection models", "short range communications", "terahertz channel model", "terahertz communications", "transmit antennas", "Directive antennas", "Graphene", "MIMO", "Rough surfaces", "Surface roughness", "Transmitting antennas", "Graphene antenna", "reconfigurable multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system", "terahertz (THz)", ""], "arnumber": "6846379"}
