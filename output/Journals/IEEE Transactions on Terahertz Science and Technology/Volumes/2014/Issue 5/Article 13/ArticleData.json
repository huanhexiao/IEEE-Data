Previously, it was reported that both physical and mental stress could be traced through the reflection coefficient of the hand, influenced by the activity of the sweat ducts, in the W (75 GHz-110 GHz) and D (110 GHz-170 GHz) frequency bands. The reflected signal was monitored from a distance of 72 cm using a Vector Network Analyzer, while the subjects Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were concurrently registered. In the current work we report on a correlation between the reflection coefficient in the same frequency bands and some of the parameters of the ECG, principally to the ST elevation. This connection bears clinical importance because of the importance of the ST segment for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction. This correlation is explored in the article.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "624", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "630", "date_publication": "Wed Jul 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14548012", "date": "Sept. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 21 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "5", "pages": "624 - 630", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Eli Safrai", "Paul Ben Ishai", "Alexander Polsman", "Sharon Einav", "Yuri Feldman"], "keywords": ["bio-optics", "biological tissues", "cognition", "diseases", "electrocardiography", "electromagnetic wave reflection", "feature extraction", "medical signal processing", "psychology", "terahertz waves", "vectors", "D frequency bands", "ECG parameter correlation", "ST elevation", "ST segment", "W frequency bands", "distance 72 cm", "electrocardiogram registration", "electromagnetic behavior", "frequency 110 GHz to 170 GHz", "frequency 75 GHz to 110 GHz", "hand reflection coefficient", "helical antenna", "human skin reflection coefficient", "human sweat duct coiled nature", "mental stress", "myocardial infarction diagnosis", "physical stress", "reflected signal monitoring", "sub-THz reflection coefficient", "sweat duct activity effect", "vector network analyzer", "Continuous wavelet transforms", "Correlation", "Electrocardiography", "Frequency measurement", "Heart", "Skin", "Stress", "Electrocardiography", "ST elevation", "millimeter-wave measurements", "remote sensing", "sub-THz", ""], "arnumber": "6868300"}
