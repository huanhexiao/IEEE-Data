The proof-of-concept results presented here demonstrate the suitability of the technique for in-line, or close to real-time, process and quality control applications in the photovoltaic (PV) industry. The experimental results show that THz pulses can detect changes in implant dosage in both the time and frequency domains. It is also shown that the spectral content of THz pulses can be used to distinguish between doping profiles with identical implant dosages but different profile shapes (resulting from different diffusion times). The reliability and repeatability of these measurements is demonstrated. It is found that the average change in THz spectrum (12.3%) corresponding to the smallest doping profile difference detected is an order of magnitude bigger than the average day-to-day measurement error (1.1%). The THz measurement approach is shown to be fully compatible with the surface morphology (texturing) of commercial mc-Si solar cells.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "560", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "567", "date_publication": "Mon Jun 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14548011", "date": "Sept. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 21 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "5", "pages": "560 - 567", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Chih-Yu Jen", "Christiaan Richter"], "keywords": ["doping profiles", "elemental semiconductors", "silicon", "solar cells", "surface morphology", "terahertz wave spectra", "time-domain analysis", "Si", "doping profile recognition", "frequency domain", "implant dosage", "in-line process", "multicrystalline silicon solar cells", "profile shapes", "quality control applications", "silicon photovoltaic cells", "silicon wafers", "spectral content", "surface morphology", "terahertz pulses", "terahertz time-domain spectroscopy", "Absorption", "Doping", "Implants", "Monitoring", "Silicon", "Spectroscopy", "Time-domain analysis", "Doping profile", "mc-Si solar cell", "metrology", "terahertz", "terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS)", "texturing", ""], "arnumber": "6846352"}
