In this work, we report the successful detection of the heart beat in the reflection coefficient of human skin, monitored at 303 and 404 GHz. The measurement was taken at a distance of 72 cm and the beam was focused on the hand palm. The results demonstrate a high correlation with the heart beat extracted from a concurrent ECG measurement. Furthermore, these frequencies demonstrate a good capability to follow phasic changes in the heart rate.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "618", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "623", "date_publication": "Tue Jul 01 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14548017", "date": "Sept. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 21 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "5", "pages": "618 - 623", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Yael Kurzweil-Segev", "Moshe Brodsky", "Alik Polsman", "Eli Safrai", "Yuri Feldman", "Sharon Einav", "Paul Ben Ishai"], "keywords": ["biomedical measurement", "cardiology", "microwave measurement", "remote sensing", "distance 72 cm", "frequency 303 GHz", "frequency 404 GHz", "heart beat detection", "high frequency sources", "human skin reflection coefficient", "palm", "phasic heart rate change monitoring", "remote monitoring", "remote physiological sensing", "Correlation", "Educational institutions", "Electrocardiography", "Frequency measurement", "Heart rate", "Skin", "Stress", "Heart rate (HR)", "phasic response", "remote monitoring", "sub-THz radiation", ""], "arnumber": "6847239"}
