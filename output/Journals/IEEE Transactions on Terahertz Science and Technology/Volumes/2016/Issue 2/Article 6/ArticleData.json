All antennas will be equipped with a new generation of dual-polarization Front-End covering the 72-373-GHz frequency range with four independent receivers integrated into a single cryostat. All receivers utilize sideband separating (2SB) superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) mixers, each of which delivers two ~7.7-GHz-wide intermediate frequency (IF) outputs per polarization channel, thus increasing the total IF bandwidth which can be processed with a single setting of the interferometer from 8 GHz (2 \u00d74 GHz delivered by the existing PdBI Front-End) to ~31 GHz (4 \u00d7 ~ 7.7 GHz delivered by the NOEMA Front-End). The first of the new NOEMA antennas (Ant. 7) has recently been completed and the first NOEMA Front-End successfully developed and installed in it. For the coming years, our goal is to upgrade all of the Front-Ends currently installed on the six existing PdBI antennas to the new NOEMA standard and to build six additional ones (plus one spare) for the new NOEMA antennas. In this paper, we describe the design, fabrication, and assembly of the Front-End we have developed for NOEMA Antenna 7. The instrument has state-of-the-art performance and sets a new standard in the post-ALMA generation technology.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "223", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "237", "date_publication": "Tue Feb 23 00:00:00 EST 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15871569", "date": "March 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "2", "pages": "223 - 237", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Jean-Yves Chenu", "Alessandro Navarrini", "Yves Bortolotti", "Gilles Butin", "Anne Laure Fontana", "Sylvain Mahieu", "Doris Maier", "Francois Mattiocco", "Patrice Serres", "Marylene Berton", "Olivier Garnier", "Quentin Moutote", "Magali Parioleau", "Bruno Pissard", "Julien Reverdy"], "keywords": ["cryostats", "electromagnetic wave polarisation", "millimetre wave antenna arrays", "millimetre wave mixers", "radio receivers", "radioastronomy", "radiowave interferometers", "submillimetre wave antennas", "submillimetre wave mixers", "superconductor-insulator-superconductor mixers", "2SB SIS mixer", "IF", "IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer", "NOEMA antenna interferometer front-end", "PdBI antenna", "cryostat", "dual-polarization front-end", "independent receiver", "intermediate frequency", "millimeter-wave radio tronomy facility", "northern extended millimeter array", "polarization channel", "post-ALMA generation technology", "sideband separating superconductor-insulator-superconductor mixers", "Antenna arrays", "Cryogenics", "Mixers", "Optics", "Radio frequency", "Receivers", "Couplers", "cryogenics", "local oscillators", "low-noise amplifiers", "millimeter-wave circuits", "mixers", "optics", "receivers", "superconductors", "wideband", ""], "arnumber": "7416253"}
