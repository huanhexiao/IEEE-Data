It consists of a push-push VCO with a 1/64 frequency divider, power amplifiers, frequency doublers, and on-chip antennas with localized backside etching. The TX-frequency is tunable in the range from 238 to 252 GHz. The TX-array has been fabricated in a 0.13- \u03bcm SiGe:C BiCMOS technology with f T /f max of 300 GHz/500 GHz. Its output power is approximately 7 dBm at 245 GHz, and the effective isotropically radiated power (EIRP) reaches 18 dBm at 245 GHz. The main components of the gas spectroscopy system are a TX and a receiver (RX) in SiGe BiCMOS as well as a gas absorption cell. The sensitivity of this spectroscopy system is demonstrated by measuring the high-resolution absorption spectrum of gaseous methanol ( CH3OH). Due to the increased power provided by the TX-array, the sensitivity of the spectrometer can be increased significantly.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "318", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "327", "date_publication": "Wed Jan 20 00:00:00 EST 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15871583", "date": "March 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "2", "pages": "318 - 327", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Klaus Schmalz", "Johannes Borngr\u00e4ber", "Wojciech Debski", "Mohamed Elkhouly", "Ruoyu Wang", "Philipp F. -X.
