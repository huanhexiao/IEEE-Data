The compact asymmetric structure utilizes all components efficiently. Different modes, including LC and quasi-quadrupole resonances, are induced in each unit cell. Simulations indicate that each of the five resonance peaks has independent characteristics with different electric field and surface current distributions. The multiband FSS provides an alternative way to design THz multiband filters, modulators, absorbers, and sensors at small planar dimensions.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "292", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "299", "date_publication": "Tue Jan 12 00:00:00 EST 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15871568", "date": "March 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "2", "pages": "292 - 299", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Shen Qiao", "Yaxin Zhang", "Yuncheng Zhao", "Yucong Zhou", "Shixiong Liang", "Ziqiang Yang"], "keywords": ["current distribution", "frequency selective surfaces", "terahertz wave devices", "LC resonances", "THz regime", "compact asymmetric structure", "electric field", "irregular electromagnetic structure", "multiband FSS device", "multiband frequency-selective surface device", "quasi-quadrupole resonances", "resonance peaks", "surface current distributions", "terahertz regime", "Capacitors", "Frequency selective surfaces", "Resonant frequency", "Silicon", "Surface waves", "Yttrium", "Asymmetric structure", "frequency-selective surface (FSS)", "multiband", "resonant characteristics", "terahertz", ""], "arnumber": "7379015"}
