The radiation collected by the telescope reflector antenna is coupled to the receiver by means of the receiver optics. These optics must be designed to match the in-coming fields from the telescope and properly characterized by amplitude and phase measurements. This paper presents a reconfigurable near-field beam pattern measurement system which can characterize magnitude and phase patterns of antennas and optics from the mm-wave to the THz region. Measurements at 900 GHz and 1.37 THz are presented for two different configurations, using different phase-lock components, and measured under cryogenic and room-temperature conditions, respectively.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "300", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "305", "date_publication": "Wed Feb 24 00:00:00 EST 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15871585", "date": "March 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "2", "pages": "300 - 305", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Alvaro Gonzalez", "Yasunori Fujii", "Takafumi Kojima", "Shin'ichiro Asayama"], "keywords": ["antenna radiation patterns", "cryogenics", "millimetre wave antennas", "millimetre wave measurement", "optical receivers", "phase measurement", "radiosources (astronomical)", "radiotelescopes", "receiving antennas", "reflector antennas", "amplitude measurement", "cryogenic", "frequency 0.03 THz to 1.6 THz", "millimeter-wave measurement", "on-ground radio astronomical observation", "phase measurement", "phase-lock component", "receiver optics", "receiving antenna", "reconfigurable near-field beam pattern measurement system", "telescope reflector antenna radiation pattern", "temperature 293 K to 298 K", "Atmospheric measurements", "Extraterrestrial measurements", "Frequency measurement", "Optics", "Phase measurement", "Radio frequency", "Receivers", "Beam pattern measurements", "THz measurement techniques", "near-field measurements", "receiver optics", ""], "arnumber": "7419273"}
