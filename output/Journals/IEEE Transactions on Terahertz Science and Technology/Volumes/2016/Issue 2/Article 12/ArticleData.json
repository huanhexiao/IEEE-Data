The super-aligned MWCNTs films were fabricated by a novel method-drawing and winding carbon nanotubes on square-shaped polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) frame. The MWCNTs film exhibited anisotropic transmittance of THz wave depending on the alignment direction of carbon nanotubes relative to the THz wave polarization orientation, which proved that such MWCNTs film acts as an ideal polarizer in the THz regime. The degree of polarization (DOP) of 99.4% and the extinction ratio (ER) of 25.3 dB (average value) has been demonstrated for a MWCNTs film of 9- \u03bcm thickness in a wide frequency range from 0.1 to 2.5 THz. Furthermore, the value of DOP and ER can be engineered expediently by controlling the film thickness. Our approach opens the possibility of MWCNTs film in application of THz optoelectronic devices.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "278", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "283", "date_publication": "Tue Feb 23 00:00:00 EST 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15871576", "date": "March 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "2", "pages": "278 - 283", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Yue Wang", "Jing-hua Yin", "Qun Wu", "Yijing Tong"], "keywords": ["multi-wall carbon nanotubes", "terahertz wave devices", "terahertz wave spectra", "multiwalled carbon nanotubes", "polytetrafluoroethylene", "terahertz polarizer application", "terahertz time-domain spectroscopy", "terahertz wave polarization orientation", "ultrathin freestanding MWCNT film", "Absorption", "Carbon nanotubes", "Erbium", "Extinction ratio", "Films", "Frequency modulation", "Time-domain analysis", "Degree of polarization", "extinction ratio", "multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)", "terahertz (THz)", ""], "arnumber": "7416256"}
