Nearly 3-dB enlargement on peak amplitude of THz radiation accompanied with broadened bandwidth is achieved with positively chirped pulse excitation. The laser with short pulsewidth assists the broadening of THz bandwidth, whereas the peak intensity of THz relies strictly on lengthened carrier lifetime. The enhancement of high-frequency radiation components at low pumping intensity also indicates the nature of power dependence in such a coherently controlled process. When photocurrent saturation occurs in the LT-MBE-grown GaAs under high-power pumping condition, the clipping effect on peak amplitude of current pulse lengthens the duration of current surge effect. Both the peak intensity and the frequency spectrum of the generated THz pulse concurrently declines. The physical mechanism related to pre-chirped pulse excitation dependent carrier dynamics is proposed to elucidate the spectral response as well as the power dependence in such a coherently controlled THz radiation process.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "253", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "261", "date_publication": "Fri Mar 11 00:00:00 EST 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15871567", "date": "March 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "2", "pages": "253 - 261", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Chao-Kuei Lee", "Yuan-Yao Lin", "Gong-Ru Lin", "Chung-Lun Wu", "Tsung-Han Wu", "Chin-Jung Chuang", "Ci-Ling Pan"], "keywords": ["III-V semiconductors", "carrier lifetime", "chirp modulation", "gallium arsenide", "intermediate-frequency amplifiers", "millimetre wave antennas", "molecular beam epitaxial growth", "photoconducting devices", "pulse shaping", "terahertz wave generation", "GaAs", "LT-MBE grown gallium arsenide", "clipping effect", "current surge effect", "enhanced broadband THz radiation", "femtosecond pumping laser pulse", "frequency spectrum", "high-frequency radiation components enhancement", "lengthened carrier lifetime", "low-temperature molecular-beam-epitaxy grown gallium arsenide", "photoconductive antenna", "photocurrent saturation", "positively chirped pulse excitation", "power dependence", "pre-chirped pulse excitation dependent carrier dynamics", "spectral response", "Broadband antennas", "Broadband communication", "Chirp", "Dipole antennas", "Laser excitation", "Pulse shaping methods", "Chirping", "pulse shaping", "spectroscopy", "terahertz", "ultrafast measurements", ""], "arnumber": "7432049"}
