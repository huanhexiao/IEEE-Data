We fabricated a new micro-bolometer array with a resonant cavity structure for a real-time THz camera, alongside a new method for evaluating the sensitivity across a wide range of the THz frequency region. The frequency dependence of the sensitivity of the THz camera is measured in the 0.5-2.0-THz frequency range taking the polarization dependence into account. It was found that the resonant cavity structure effectively increased the sensitivity of the THz camera, and, actually, the improvement by one order of magnitude was achieved in the frequency range below 1 THz. The THz camera with much enhanced sensitivity will expand the frontiers of real-time THz imaging such as molecular imaging and nondestructive inspection.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "175", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "182", "date_publication": "Mon Dec 28 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15871570", "date": "March 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "2", "pages": "175 - 182", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Natsuki Nemoto", "Natsuki Kanda", "Ryo Imai", "Kuniaki Konishi", "Masaru Miyoshi", "Seiji Kurashina", "Tokuhito Sasaki", "Naoki Oda", "Makoto Kuwata-Gonokami"], "keywords": ["bolometers", "cavity resonators", "focal planes", "real-time systems", "terahertz wave imaging", "focal plane array", "microbolometer array", "real-time imaging", "real-time terahertz camera", "resonant cavity structure", "Cameras", "Cavity resonators", "Detectors", "Real-time systems", "Sensitivity", "Silicon compounds", "Compact terahertz camera", "focal plane array", "micro-bolometer", "real-time imaging", "terahertz (THz)", ""], "arnumber": "7366766"}
