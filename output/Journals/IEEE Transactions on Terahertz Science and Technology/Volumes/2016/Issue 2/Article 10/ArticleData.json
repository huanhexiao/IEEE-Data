The results show that the quasi-optical cavity plays a very important role in the coherent SPR resonance and energy feedback which leads to an enhanced coherent SPR with relatively high efficiency and low current density. Moreover, it is found that the radiated field intensity and field energy of the coherent SPR with the quasi-optical cavity has been improved five times and almost one order of magnitude, respectively, compared with those without the cavity. This system provides an alternative way for high-performance THz sources.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "262", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "267", "date_publication": "Thu Feb 11 00:00:00 EST 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15871571", "date": "March 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "2", "pages": "262 - 267", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Yucong Zhou", "Yaxin Zhang", "Shenggang Liu"], "keywords": ["circular waveguides", "electron beams", "terahertz waves", "annular electron beam", "coherent SPR resonance", "cylindrical quasioptical cavity", "cylindrical surface wave", "electron-beam-driven enhanced terahertz coherent Smith-Purcell radiation", "energy feedback", "Cavity resonators", "Current density", "Gratings", "Harmonic analysis", "Optical surface waves", "Solid modeling", "Surface waves", "Beam-wave interaction", "coherent Smith&#x2013", "Purcell radiation", "quasi-optical cavity", "terahertz (THz)", ""], "arnumber": "7404045"}
