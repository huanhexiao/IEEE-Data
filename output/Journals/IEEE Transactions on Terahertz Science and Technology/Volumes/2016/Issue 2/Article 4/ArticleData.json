The low-frequency array (LFA) is designed to cover the 1.9-2.5 THz range using 2 \u00d7 7-pixel waveguide-based HEB mixer arrays in a dual polarization configuration. The high-frequency array (HFA) will perform observations of the [OI] line at ~ 4.745 THz using a 7-pixel waveguide- based HEB mixer array. This paper describes the common design for both arrays, cooled to 4.5 K using closed-cycle pulse tube technology. We then show the laboratory and telescope characterization of the first array with its 14 pixels (LFA), which culminated in the successful commissioning in May 2015 aboard the SOFIA airborne observatory observing the [CII] fine structure transition at 1.9005 THz. This is the first successful demonstration of astronomical observations with a heterodyne focal plane array above 1 THz and is also the first time high-power closed-cycle coolers for temperatures below 4.5 K are operated on an airborne platform.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "199", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "211", "date_publication": "Mon Dec 28 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15871581", "date": "March 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "2", "pages": "199 - 211", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Christophe Risacher", "Rolf G\u00fcsten", "J\u00fcrgen Stutzki", "Heinz-Wilhelm H\u00fcbers", "Denis B\u00fcchel", "Urs U.
