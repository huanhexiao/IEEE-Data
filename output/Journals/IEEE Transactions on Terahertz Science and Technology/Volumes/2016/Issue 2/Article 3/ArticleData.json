We develop all the steps starting from a 3-D tomographic reconstruction of a sample from radiographs acquired with a monochromatic millimeter-wave imaging system to an automated segmentation, extracting the different volumes of interest (VOI) composing the sample. This leads to 3-D visualization and dimensional measurements. This inspection is completed by a skeletonization and caliber analysis providing an accurate assessment of the structure, geometry, and morphology of the acquired object. Overall sequence is implemented onto an unique software and validated through different sample analysis.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "191", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "198", "date_publication": "Mon Feb 08 00:00:00 EST 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15871577", "date": "March 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "2", "pages": "191 - 198", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Hugo Balacey", "Benoit Recur", "Jean-Baptiste Perraud", "Joyce Bou Sleiman", "Jean-Paul Guillet", "Patrick Mounaix"], "keywords": ["computerised tomography", "data visualisation", "feature extraction", "image reconstruction", "image segmentation", "image sequences", "inspection", "radiography", "3D THz imaging", "3D tomographic reconstruction", "3D visualization", "CW-THz CT", "VOI extraction", "caliber analysis", "continuous-wave terahertz computed tomography", "dimensional measurement", "image processing sequence", "image segmentation", "nondestructive inspection", "radiograph", "skeletonization", "volumes of interest", "Image reconstruction", "Image segmentation", "Labeling", "Radiography", "Skeleton", "Tomography", "Caliber analysis", "THz tomography", "nondestructive testing", "processing sequence", "segmentation", "skeletonization", ""], "arnumber": "7401133"}
