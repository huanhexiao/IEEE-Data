In this paper, we analyze the impact of random phase and amplitude errors and prism misalignment on the optical constants extracted from the ATR THz-TDS measurements. Analytical models together with empirical data suggest that, among those factors, small prism misalignment has a relatively strong impact on the optical constants. We propose an alternative configuration for ATR THz-TDS that significantly reduces the impact of prism misalignment between the reference and sample measurements. As a result, this configuration facilitates repetitive reference and sample scans to mitigate the effect from long-term signal drifts. Based on this proposed method, the measured optical constants of distilled water and pure ethanol have a significantly reduced uncertainty. The presented analysis and method can be used to improve the measurement accuracy in standard ATR THz-TDS setups.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "32", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "39", "date_publication": "Fri Jan 08 00:00:00 EST 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15721737", "date": "Jan. 2016", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 20 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "32 - 39", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Amin Soltani", "David Jahn", "Lennart Duschek", "Enrique Castro-Camus", "Martin Koch", "Withawat Withayachumnankul"], "keywords": ["attenuated total reflection", "measurement standards", "measurement uncertainty", "optical constants", "optical variables measurement", "submillimetre wave measurement", "terahertz spectroscopy", "ATR THz-TDS measurement", "absorptive media", "amplitude error", "attenuated total reflection terahertz time-domain spectroscopy", "long-term signal drift effect", "optical constant extraction measurement", "prism misalignment", "random phase error", "reduction uncertainty analysis scheme", "Adaptive optics", "Lenses", "Optical attenuators", "Optical refraction", "Refractive index", "Spectroscopy", "Standards", "Attenuated total internal reflection spectroscopy", "measurement uncertainty", "terahertz (THz)", "terahertz spectroscopy of water", ""], "arnumber": "7377132"}
