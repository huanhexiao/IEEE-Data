In order to make these devices more integrated, the thickness of the absorber is crucial. In this paper, a compact, polarization-independent, broadband, omnidirectional terahertz (THz) absorber is proposed, fabricated, and evaluated. This THz absorber is based on the combined effect of the multi-interference and diffraction. It is experimentally demonstrated that over 95% absorption can be obtained in the frequency range from 0.75 to 2.41 THz. This well-designed thinner absorber not only reduces the device thickness to 120 \u03bcm, but also introduces more interference peaks so that the absorption spectrum is significantly enlarged. Five successive absorption peaks at 0.88, 1.20, 1.53, 1.96, and 2.23 THz are combined into a broadband THz absorption spectrum.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "40", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "44", "date_publication": "Thu Nov 19 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15721733", "date": "Jan. 2016", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 20 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "40 - 44", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Cheng Shi", "Xiao Fei Zang", "Lin Chen", "Yan Peng", "Bin Cai", "Geoffrey R.
