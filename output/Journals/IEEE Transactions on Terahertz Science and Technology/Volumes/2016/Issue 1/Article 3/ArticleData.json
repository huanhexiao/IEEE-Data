However, the emission of unwanted echoes, resulting from reflections of the emitted pulse in the antenna substrate, inherently limits the spectroscopic frequency resolution. A novel interdigitated photoconductive antenna that suppresses unwanted echoes from the substrate, without power losses, is proposed and demonstrated. This is realized through a buried metal geometry where a metal plane is placed at a sub-wavelength thickness below the surface antenna structure and GaAs active layer. In a reflection geometry this effectively eliminates echoes, permitting high resolution spectroscopy to be performed. As a proof-of-principle, the 1 01 -2 12 and the 2 12 -3 03 rotational lines of water vapor have been spectrally resolved with the new buried metal antenna, which are unresolvable with a standard antenna. In addition, as no THz field is lost to the substrate and reflections, the THz peak electric field amplitude is enhanced by a factor of three compared to a standard design in the equivalent reflection geometry.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "20", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "Mon Dec 28 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15721732", "date": "Jan. 2016", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 20 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "20 - 25", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Kenneth Maussang", "Anthony Brewer", "Jos\u00e9 Palomo", "Jean-Michel Manceau", "Raffaele Colombelli", "Isabelle Sagnes", "Juliette Mangeney", "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Tignon", "Sukhdeep S.
