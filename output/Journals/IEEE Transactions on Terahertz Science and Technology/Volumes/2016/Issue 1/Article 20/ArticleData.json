We have carried out investigations by means of numerical simulations as well as reflection and transmission measurements. Simulations were performed using the finite element method, an efficient quasi-analytical technique, and rigorous coupled-wave analysis. We used an injection-molded vacuum window prototype as a starting point of the design process and investigated deterioration in the electromagnetic performance caused by different types of manufacturing artifacts. Following these analyses, an optimization of the window has been performed based on simulations. We measured the reflectivity and transmittance of the newly designed window and this paper demonstrates that the optimized window exhibits a return loss better than -20 dB, as required by the ALMA specifications.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "156", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "162", "date_publication": "Thu Dec 17 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15721730", "date": "Jan. 2016", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 20 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "156 - 162", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Arne Schr\u00f6der", "Axel Murk", "Pavel Yagoubov", "Ferdinand Patt"], "keywords": ["electromagnetic wave reflection", "electromagnetic wave transmission", "finite element analysis", "radiotelescopes", "ALMA band 5 vacuum window", "Atacama large millimeter/sub-millimeter array band 5", "coupled-wave analysis", "electromagnetic design", "finite element method", "frequency 163 GHz to 211 GHz", "injection-molded vacuum window prototype", "quasianalytical technique", "reflection measurements", "transmission measurements", "Approximation methods", "Finite element analysis", "Geometry", "Numerical models", "Optical variables measurement", "Prototypes", "Vacuum technology", "Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)", "electromagnetic analysis", "numerical techniques", "vacuum window", ""], "arnumber": "7360248"}
