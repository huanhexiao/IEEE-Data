Utilizing 30 nm InP HEMT MMICs for the front-end LNA and mixers, the system is cooled to 27 K and operates from 200 GHz to 260 GHz. The system is measured in a cryostat that couples the hot, cold and test signal to the DUT without passing through an optical window, reducing losses in the optical path. An average single-sideband (SSB) noise temperature of 92 K is measured across the band. Sideband rejection ratios are between 10 and 15 dB.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "141", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "147", "date_publication": "Mon Dec 28 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15721727", "date": "Jan. 2016", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 20 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "141 - 147", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Theodore Reck", "Alex Zemora", "Erich Schlecht", "Robert Dengler", "William Deal", "Goutam Chattopadhyay"], "keywords": ["MMIC", "high electron mobility transistors", "low noise amplifiers", "microwave receivers", "DUT", "HEMT MMIC", "MMIC-based sideband separating receiver", "cryostat", "frequency 230 GHz", "front-end LNA", "single-sideband noise temperature", "Amplitude modulation", "Loss measurement", "MMICs", "Mixers", "Receivers", "Temperature measurement", "Temperature sensors", "InP HEMT", "MMIC", "sideband-separating receiver", ""], "arnumber": "7366768"}
