The superconducting switch, comprising three niobium nitride (NbN) bridges, is deposited across the slotline section of a back-to-back unilateral finline. The transmission characteristics of the superconducting switch illuminated by a millimeter source was measured using a superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) tunnel junction as direct detector. The NbN bridges were switched from the superconducting state to the normal state by passing current through the bridges with magnitude that exceeds its critical current value. With this arrangement, we have measured a typical switching dynamic range of approximately 10 dB across the 205-240 GHz band, with the highest dynamic range of ~ 20 dB at 230 GHz. This demonstrated the successful operation of the multiple NbN bridges as a planar superconducting on/off switch.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "121", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "126", "date_publication": "Tue Dec 01 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15721728", "date": "Jan. 2016", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 20 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "121 - 126", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Boon-Kok Tan", "Ghassan Yassin", "Ernst Otto", "Leonid Kuzmin"], "keywords": ["bridge circuits", "millimetre wave circuits", "niobium compounds", "superconducting switches", "superconductor-insulator-superconductor devices", "NbN", "SIS tunnel junction", "back-to-back unilateral finline", "bandwidth 205 GHz to 240 GHz", "direct detector", "millimeter wavelengths", "niobium nitride bridges", "planar superconducting on/off switch", "slotline section", "superconducting state", "superconductor-insulator-superconductor tunnel junction", "Bridge circuits", "Impedance", "Optical switches", "Slot lines", "Superconducting devices", "Superconducting transmission lines", "Millimeter astronomy", "millimeter wave devices", "millimeter-wave technology", "modulators", "terahertz (THz) switch", ""], "arnumber": "7342990"}
