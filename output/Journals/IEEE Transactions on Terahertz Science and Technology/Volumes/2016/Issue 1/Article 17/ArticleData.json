In this paper, an LNA that is optimized for direct connection to a 220-GHz SIS mixer chip and requires less than 100 \u03bcW of dc power is reported. The amplifier design process is described, and measurement results are presented. It is shown that, when pumped at local oscillator frequencies between 214 and 226 GHz, the mixer/amplifier module achieves a double-sideband system noise temperature between 35 and 50 K over the 3.3-6 GHz IF frequency range while requiring just 90 \u03bcW of dc power. Moreover, the potential to further reduce the power consumption is explored and successful operation is demonstrated for LNA power consumption as low as 60 \u03bcW.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "133", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "140", "date_publication": "Wed Nov 25 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15721729", "date": "Jan. 2016", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 20 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "133 - 140", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Shirin Montazeri", "Paul K.
