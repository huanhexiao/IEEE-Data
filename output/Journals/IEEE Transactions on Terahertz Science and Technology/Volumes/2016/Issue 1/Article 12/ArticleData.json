A theoretical description based on Gaussian beam theory and a transfer function approach enabled simulation of signals transmitted around and reflected from real particles and was able to predict signal detectability. Simulated signals and detection limits were compared with experimental transmission and reflection time domain spectroscopy (TDS) raster scanning data. Simulated and measured pulse amplitude and shape were in agreement. Reflection mode was superior to transmission mode in terms of both particle visibility and hit ratio. Imaging of particles was also possible in \u201creflection in transmission\u201d mode, which can be used to complement classical transmission mode. X-ray images did not detect the smallest particles sufficiently and, therefore, could not be used as reference data for comparison with THz data. The results demonstrate that TDS reflection scanning is able to determine the position of small metal particles and the technique could be possibly used for quality control of pressboard insulation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "99", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "107", "date_publication": "Fri Dec 11 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15721726", "date": "Jan. 2016", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 20 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "99 - 107", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Norbert Palka", "Andrzej Rybak", "Elzbieta Czerwi\u0144ska", "Marek Florkowski"], "keywords": ["signal detection", "terahertz wave detectors", "terahertz wave imaging", "transfer functions", "Gaussian beam theory", "TDS raster scanning data", "TDS reflection scanning", "X-ray images", "X-ray scanner", "hit ratio", "particle visibility", "pressboard insulation", "pressboard samples", "pulse amplitude", "quality control", "randomly-oriented metal particles", "reflection mode", "reflection time domain spectroscopy", "signal detectability prediction", "terahertz detection", "transfer function approach", "transmission spectroscopy", "wavelength-size metal particles", "Atmospheric measurements", "Detectors", "Metals", "Particle measurements", "Shape", "Transfer functions", "X-ray imaging", "Imaging", "product safety engineering", "security", ""], "arnumber": "7353225"}
