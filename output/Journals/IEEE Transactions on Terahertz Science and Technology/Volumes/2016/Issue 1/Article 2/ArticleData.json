We propose a theoretical study to determine the minimum observable peak amplitude versus the refractive index and the coefficient of absorption of the sample material. We discuss the case of detecting the absorption peaks from the amplitude or phase of the transmitted or reflected spectra recorded using a THz time-domain spectroscopy system. We experimentally validate our analysis by studying a pellet sample of glutamic acid, bare or hidden under a layer of various fabrics, both in transmission and reflection configuration. This allows us to investigate the influence of various radiometric responses induced by fabrics when spectra are recorded in realistic conditions. In the reflection scheme, interference effects make the identification difficult, if not impossible.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "12", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "19", "date_publication": "Wed Nov 04 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15721738", "date": "Jan. 2016", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 20 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "12 - 19", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Emilie H\u00e9rault", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Garet", "Jean-Louis Coutaz"], "keywords": ["fingerprint identification", "image sensors", "light absorption", "radiometry", "submillimetre wave detectors", "terahertz spectroscopy", "terahertz wave detectors", "absorption coefficient", "absorption peak detection", "fabrics", "glutamic acid", "interference effect", "minimum observable peak amplitude", "pellet sample", "radiometric response", "reflected spectra recording", "refractive index", "remote active THz spectroscopy", "spectral fingerprint material detection", "terahertz spectroscopy", "time-domain spectroscopy system", "transmitted spectra recording", "Absorption", "Cotton", "Fabrics", "Refractive index", "Sensitivity", "Spectroscopy", "Weaving", "Fingerprint identification", "THZ time-domain spectroscopy (THZ-TDS)", "material characterization", "reflection spectroscopy", "transmission spectroscopy", ""], "arnumber": "7317824"}
