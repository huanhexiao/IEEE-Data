The measured vector beam patterns are fitted into fundamental Gaussian beam modes. We verify our measurement by comparing the corrugated horn result with its well-established theoretical pattern. The positions and diameters of the beam waists of all of the measured horns are derived from the fitted fundamental Gaussian beam and are in good agreement with those obtained from numerical calculations.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "163", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "168", "date_publication": "Mon Dec 21 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15721736", "date": "Jan. 2016", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 20 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "163 - 168", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Lingzhen Zeng", "Cheukyu Edward Tong", "Paul K.
