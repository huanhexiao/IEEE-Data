The tool is based on a Monte Carlo model of the diode coupled with a multi-tone harmonic balance technique. A remarkable feature of this tool is that it avoids the need of analytical or empirical models. The validation of the tool has been carried out by comparing simulation results with measurements of mixers published in the literature up to 2.5 THz. The usefulness of Schottky diodes as frequency mixers above 2.5 THz is analyzed. Additionally, the range of application and the limitations of simpler simulation tools based on lumped equivalent circuits or drift-diffusion models have been evaluated using the Monte Carlo model as a reference.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "69", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "82", "date_publication": "Mon Dec 07 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15721731", "date": "Jan. 2016", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 20 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "69 - 82", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Diego Pardo", "Jes\u00fas Grajal", "Susana P\u00e9rez"], "keywords": ["Monte Carlo methods", "Schottky diode mixers", "equivalent circuits", "gallium arsenide", "millimetre wave mixers", "GaAs", "Monte Carlo model", "Schottky diodes", "Schottky mixers", "conversion losses", "drift-diffusion models", "frequency 2.5 THz", "frequency mixers", "lumped equivalent circuits", "multi-tone harmonic balance technique", "noise temperature", "Analytical models", "Harmonic analysis", "Integrated circuit modeling", "Mixers", "Monte Carlo methods", "Schottky diodes", "Solid modeling", "Drift-diffusion", "Monte Carlo", "Schottky diode", "THz frequencies", "frequency mixer", "harmonic balance technique", "lumped equivalent circuit (LEC)", "numerical modeling", ""], "arnumber": "7348725"}
