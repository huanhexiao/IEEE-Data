Such liquids recently became of considerable concern for transportation security measures worldwide. Their optical identification at check-in gates can only become possible if the characteristic spectra are already known. The refractive indices and the extinction coefficients reported here contribute to a spectroscopic data base in the far-IR and terahertz (THz) spectral regions and may support modeling the performance of THz screening systems on liquids for airports and other security sensitive areas. Examples of several container material/liquid systems are discussed. From the measured optical constants typical THz waveforms are calculated and discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "396", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "407", "date_publication": "Mon May 30 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "16073154", "date": "May 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 14 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "3", "pages": "396 - 407", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["J\u00f6rg Beckmann", "Barbara Marchetti", "Lars S. von Chrzanowski", "Eglof Ritter", "Ljiljana Puskar", "Emad F.
