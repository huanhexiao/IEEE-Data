There are several types of hemostats of different composition therefore with different mechanism of action. Here, terahertz (THz) time-domain spectroscopy is used for studying the absorption kinetics of the reactions between the hemostatic and the physiological saline solution (PSS). The reactions correspond with the changes of the THz radiation response measured in time. These time dependences are analyzed to find time constants for mathematical description of the hemostatic kinetics and the significant differences among all types of hemostats are found. The physiological saline solution is replaced by human blood in the additional measurement. Based on the results, we can compare the reaction rate of different types of hemostats that could be beneficial in the surgery practice.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "420", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "426", "date_publication": "Tue Mar 22 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "date": "May 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 14 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "3", "pages": "420 - 426", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Marie Nedvedova", "Vojtech Kresalek", "Zdenek Adamik", "Ivo Provaznik"], "keywords": ["Blood", "Crystals", "Refractive index", "Spectroscopy", "Surgery", "Time-domain analysis", "Absorbable hemostat", "kinetics", "physiological saline solution (PSS)", "terahertz (THz) time-domain spectroscopy", ""], "arnumber": "7438938"}
