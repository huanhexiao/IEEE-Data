Nanoscale slot-antenna-based metamaterials were designed for the strong THz resonance at a certain frequency, where the specific molecule has intramolecular or intermolecular collective vibrational mode. Enhanced THz near-field via a nano-antenna metamaterial strongly increases absorption cross section, and this leads to the detection sensitivity up to parts-per-billion level even in a solution state of pesticide sample. Measured transmittance and reflectance spectrum results show excellent performances in both sensitivity and selectivity. We also imaged reflected THz signals though our THz nano-metamaterials in a nondestructive manner to simply detect the contained residual pesticide at the surface of an apple as it is, without any treatment. This observation can offer the possibility for further various applications as prompt and accurate molecule sensing tools in real time.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "389", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "395", "date_publication": "Wed Apr 20 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "16073159", "date": "May 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 14 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "3", "pages": "389 - 395", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Dong-Kyu Lee", "Giyoung Kim", "Chulki Kim", "Young Min Jhon", "Jae Hun Kim", "Taikjin Lee", "Joo-Hiuk Son", "Minah Seo"], "keywords": ["chemical sensors", "chemical variables measurement", "nanosensors", "organic compounds", "slot antennas", "spectrochemical analysis", "terahertz metamaterials", "terahertz wave detectors", "terahertz wave spectra", "vibrational modes", "THz near-field enhancement", "THz resonance", "absorption cross section", "intermolecular collective vibrational mode", "intramolecular collective vibrational mode", "methomyl", "molecule sensing tools", "nanoscale slot-antenna-based metamaterials", "reflectance spectrum", "residual pesticide ultrasensitive detection", "terahertz time-domain spectroscopy", "transmittance spectrum", "Absorption", "Metamaterials", "Optical variables measurement", "Resonant frequency", "Sensors", "Silicon", "Spectroscopy", "Nano-metamaterial", "THz imaging", "THz time-domain spectroscopy", "nondestructive detection", "residual pesticide detection", "terahertz (THz)", ""], "arnumber": "7454771"}
