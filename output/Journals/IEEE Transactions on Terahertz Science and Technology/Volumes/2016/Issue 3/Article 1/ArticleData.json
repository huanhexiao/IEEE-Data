This technology is particularly useful for examining objects, such as nanomaterials, polymers, cells, and biomolecules. The first part of this paper briefly explains two types of near-field THz imaging technologies: aperture type and apertureless type. The second part explains our chip-based near-field imaging technology. We perform collection-mode near-field THz imaging by scanning an evanescently coupled THz detector closely across a sample surface. The implementation of a magnetically tunable THz detection method further enables us to obtain frequency-selective near-field THz images. As an application of this technology, cryogenic THz-emission imaging is presented, wherein THz radiation associated with electron injection into a semiconductor device is imaged with no THz pump source. This technique provides direct information about the spatial distribution of electrons injected from an electrode into a semiconductor channel.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "356", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "364", "date_publication": "Mon Apr 25 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "16088587", "date": "May 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 14 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "3", "pages": "356 - 364", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Yukio Kawano"], "keywords": ["nanosensors", "terahertz wave detectors", "terahertz wave imaging", "THz radiation", "biomolecules", "cells", "chip-based near-field terahertz microscopy", "collection-mode near-field THz imaging", "cryogenic THz-emission imaging", "electrode", "electron injection", "evanescently coupled THz detector", "frequency-selective near-field THz images", "magnetically tunable THz detection", "nanomaterials", "polymers", "semiconductor channel", "spatial electron distribution", "Apertures", "Crystals", "Image resolution", "Microscopy", "Optical surface waves", "Probes", "Heterojunctions", "nanosensors", "scanning-probe microscopy", "semiconductor devices", ""], "arnumber": "7458885"}
