The scheme holds a concise system architecture comprising a frequency scanning reflector antenna (FSRA) as the transmitting antenna, an omnidirectional antenna as the receiving antenna, and a vector network analyzer as the transceiver. By employing the diffraction enhancement mechanism to improve the diffraction efficiency and to suppress the specular beam, a high-directivity FSRA with periodic planar binary structure is proposed and developed at 0.235-0.33 THz band for imaging applications. A superresolution algorithm is proposed and developed by combining the direction of arrival (DoA) estimation and the matched filter technique, in which the tradeoff between available range and azimuth information can be successfully overcome. To achieve DoA estimation, the MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm which is commonly used in phased-array antennas is extended to the novel imaging scheme based on FSRA, which is referred to as FS-MUSIC algorithm. The model of FSRA manifold vector is constructed for FS-MUSIC with a modified spatial smoothing method specifically developed to decorrelate the coherent back-scattering signals and to resolve the targets located within a same half-power beamwidth (HPBW). The resolution of the FS-MUSIC algorithm is derived based on the Bayesian approach. Superresolution imaging with real-time capability was demonstrated by both the simulation and the proof-of-principle experiments in the 0.3-THz band. An FSRA operating on 0.3-THz frequency band was developed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "451", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "463", "date_publication": "Mon Mar 07 00:00:00 EST 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "16073155", "date": "May 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 14 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "3", "pages": "451 - 463", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Shichao Li", "Chao Li", "Wei Liu", "Zhaoyang Sun", "Shinan Lang", "Zheng Lu", "Xiaojuan Zhang", "Guangyou Fang"], "keywords": ["Bayes methods", "antenna phased arrays", "array signal processing", "direction-of-arrival estimation", "matched filters", "millimetre wave antenna arrays", "omnidirectional antennas", "planar antenna arrays", "receiving antennas", "reflectarray antennas", "scanning antennas", "signal classification", "signal resolution", "smoothing methods", "submillimetre wave antennas", "terahertz wave imaging", "transmitting antennas", "Bayesian approach", "DoA estimation", "FS-MUSIC algorithm resolution", "coherent back-scattering signals", "concise system architecture", "diffraction efficiency", "diffraction enhancement mechanism", "direction of arrival estimation", "frequency 0.235 THz to 0.33 THz", "frequency scanning reflector antenna", "frequency-controlled beam scanning", "half-power beamwidth", "matched filter technique", "modified spatial smoothing method", "multiple signal classification algorithm", "omnidirectional antenna", "periodic planar binary structure", "phased-array antennas", "real-time capability", "receiving antenna", "specular beam", "superresolution algorithm", "terahertz superresolution imaging scheme", "transceiver", "transmitting antenna", "vector network analyzer", "Antennas", "Direction-of-arrival estimation", "Gratings", "Imaging", "Signal resolution", "Spatial resolution", "Direction of arrival (DoA) estimation", "FS-MUSIC", "frequency scanning reflector antennas (FSRA)", "spatial smoothing method", "superresolution imaging", "terahertz", ""], "arnumber": "7426856"}
