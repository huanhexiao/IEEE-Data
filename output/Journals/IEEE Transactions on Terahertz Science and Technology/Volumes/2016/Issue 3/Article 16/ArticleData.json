As many as four different measurement methods were employed to cover the band of interest, including the terahertz time-domain spectroscopy and the Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy besides resonator techniques applicable in the microwave band and the four-point dc technique. Raw measurement data obtained using these approaches were processed and based on the results a relationship between frequency and sheet resistance for various types of new graphene-based conductive layers was extracted. Eventually, several models that help to explain the observed behavior of each of the analyzed conductive inks were proposed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "480", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "490", "date_publication": "Fri Apr 29 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "16073165", "date": "May 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 14 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "3", "pages": "480 - 490", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Pawel Kopyt", "Bartlomiej Salski", "Przemyslaw Zagrajek", "Daniel Janczak", "Marcin Sloma", "Malgorzata Jakubowska", "Marzena Olszewska-Placha", "Wojciech Gwarek"], "keywords": ["electrical conductivity", "graphene", "nanofabrication", "nanostructured materials", "terahertz wave spectra", "thin films", "C", "Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy", "band of interest", "conductive inks", "four-point dc technique", "frequency band spanning", "frequency resistance", "graphene nanoplatelets", "graphene-based conductive layers", "microwave band", "raw measurement data", "resonator techniques", "sheet resistance", "terahertz hybrid measurement methodology", "terahertz time-domain spectroscopy", "thin conductive layers", "Curing", "Dielectric measurement", "Electrical resistance measurement", "Graphene", "Ink", "Microwave measurement", "Resistance", "Carbon compounds", "carbon nanotubes", "cavity resonators", "material properties", "spectroscopy", "submillimeter-wave measurements", ""], "arnumber": "7463081"}
