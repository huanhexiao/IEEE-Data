In order to combine the differential output signals of the RTD differential oscillator, an on-chip dipole antenna is integrated into the InP-based RTD monolithic microwave integrated circuit technology. The fabricated RTD differential oscillator shows a radiated output power of 47 \u03bcW with a total dc power consumption of 14.1 mW at an oscillation frequency of 675 GHz. A high dc-to-RF efficiency of 0.33% has been obtained. This is the first implementation as an RTD differential oscillator topology for THz sources, integrated with the on-chip dipole antenna.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "510", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "512", "date_publication": "Mon May 02 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "16073169", "date": "May 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 14 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "3", "pages": "510 - 512", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Maengkyu Kim", "Jooseok Lee", "Jongwon Lee", "Kyounghoon Yang"], "keywords": ["III-V semiconductors", "dipole antennas", "indium compounds", "resonant tunnelling diodes", "submillimetre wave integrated circuits", "submillimetre wave oscillators", "InP", "InP-based RTD monolithic microwave integrated circuit technology", "RTD differential oscillator topology", "RTD-based differential oscillator topology", "THz applications", "THz sources", "dc power consumption", "dc-to-RF efficiency", "differential output signals", "frequency 675 GHz", "on-chip dipole antenna", "oscillation frequency", "output power coupling", "power 14.1 mW", "resonant tunneling diode based differential oscillator topology", "Antenna measurements", "Dipole antennas", "Indium phosphide", "Oscillators", "Power generation", "Resonant tunneling devices", "System-on-chip", "Differential oscillator", "THz signal source", "on-chip dipole antenna", "resonant tunneling diode", ""], "arnumber": "7463488"}
