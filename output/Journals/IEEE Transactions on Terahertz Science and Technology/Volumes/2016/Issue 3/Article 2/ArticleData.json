The PC probes are compatible to optical gating with a femtosecond laser having a center wavelength of 1550 nm. Therefore, they are well suited for a cost-efficient direct integration with fiber-coupled THz time-domain spectroscopy (TDS) systems. The photoconductor material features electron lifetimes of 500 fs allowing for broadband detection up to 2 THz, which is comparable to existing LT-GaAs-based near-field detectors, which require 800-nm wavelength excitation. We demonstrate the detector operation in a state-of-the-art fiber-based TDS system with fast and coherent data acquisition and show obtained sheet-resistance mappings of conductive thin-films featuring subwavelength resolution.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "365", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "370", "date_publication": "Wed Apr 27 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "16073166", "date": "May 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 14 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "3", "pages": "365 - 370", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Simon Sawallich", "Bj\u00f6rn Globisch", "Christopher Matheisen", "Michael Nagel", "Roman J.
