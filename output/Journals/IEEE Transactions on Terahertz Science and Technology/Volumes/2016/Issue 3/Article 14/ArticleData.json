In this paper, we consider most sought after applications of phase imaging provided by this technique and experimentally demonstrate the ability of the method to reconstruct smooth and stepped relief features of an object that is transparent in THz region. Unlike the amplitude distribution, which does not contain any significant information in this case, phase distribution not only reveals the object qualitatively, but also allows the reconstruction of the object thicknesses pattern, even in low signal-to-noise registration conditions. Main limitations of the proposed method, such as transverse resolution and low signal-to-noise environment are carefully studied and mitigated.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "464", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "472", "date_publication": "Tue Apr 05 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "16073164", "date": "May 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 14 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "3", "pages": "464 - 472", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Nikolay V.
