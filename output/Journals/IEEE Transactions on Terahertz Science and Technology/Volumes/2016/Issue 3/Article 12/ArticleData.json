At these frequencies, the modulus of transmittance of a sample could be null, or at least smaller than the detector noise, and consequently the signal phase is lost, not only at the peak frequency, but also at higher frequencies. Thus, for these high frequencies, the value of the refractive index estimated from the measured THz-TDS data could be strongly erroneous. Using an optimized version of KKR, namely singly subtractive KKR, we are able to retrieve the phase of the THz transmittance over the whole studied bandwidth and thus to correct the THz-TDS data to precisely determine the refractive index as well as the absorption coefficient of the material over almost the whole THz range.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "442", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "450", "date_publication": "Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "16073157", "date": "May 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 14 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "3", "pages": "442 - 450", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Maxime Bernier", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Garet", "Jean-Louis Coutaz", "Hiroaki Minamide", "Atsushi Sato"], "keywords": ["Kramers-Kronig relations", "absorption coefficients", "refractive index", "terahertz wave spectra", "Kramers-Kronig analysis", "Tetrahertz transmittance", "absorption coefficient", "detector noise", "refractive index", "terahertz time-domain spectroscopy", "transmission materials", "transmittance modulus", "Absorption", "Bandwidth", "Finite wordlength effects", "Frequency measurement", "Phase frequency detector", "Refractive index", "Spectroscopy", "Kramers-kronig relations", "terahertz", "time-domain spectroscopy", ""], "arnumber": "7446362"}
