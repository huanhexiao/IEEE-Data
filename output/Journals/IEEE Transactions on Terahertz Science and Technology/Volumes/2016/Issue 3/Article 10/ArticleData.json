Thorough studies are performed on the attenuation of electromagnetic waves inside the human skin, while taking into account the frequency of operation, distance between the nano-machines and number of sweat ducts. A novel channel model is presented for communication of nano-machines inside the human skin and its validation is performed by varying the aforementioned parameters with a reasonable accuracy. The statistics of error prediction between simulated and modeled data are: mean (\u03bc)= 0.6 dB and standard deviation (\u03c3)= 0.4 dB, which indicates the high accuracy of the prediction model as compared with measurement data from simulation. In addition, the results of proposed channel model are compared with terhaertz time-domain spectroscopy based measurement of skin sample and the statistics of error prediction in this case are: \u03bc = 2.10 dB and \u03c3 = 6.23 dB, which also validates the accuracy of proposed model. Results in this paper highlight the issues and related challenges while characterizing the communication in such a medium, thus paving the way towards novel research activities devoted to the design and the optimization of advanced applications in the healthcare domain.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "427", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "434", "date_publication": "Mon Apr 04 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "16073168", "date": "May 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 14 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "3", "pages": "427 - 434", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Qammer H.
