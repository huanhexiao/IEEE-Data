State-of-the-art measurement systems at THz frequencies have been implemented and successfully used to measure the performance of the first six receivers. Extensive tests ranging from receiver sensitivity and stability to optical aperture efficiency on the secondary antenna have been performed. Performance of all six receivers is well within the stringent ALMA requirements. Moreover, our extensive tests have shown that there are no big performance differences between receivers. These results indicate that the ALMA Band 10 receiver is ready for the production phase, during which an additional 67 receivers will be produced and characterized.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "39", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "49", "date_publication": "Wed Jan 30 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13287405", "date": "Jan. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "1", "pages": "39 - 49", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Yasunori Fujii", "Alvaro Gonzalez", "Matthias Kroug", "Keiko Kaneko", "Akihira Miyachi", "Takao Yokoshima", "Koichi Kuroiwa", "Hideo Ogawa", "Kazumasa Makise", "Zhen Wang", "Yoshinori Uzawa"], "keywords": ["antenna arrays", "millimetre wave receivers", "radiotelescopes", "submillimetre wave receivers", "ALMA band 10 receivers", "Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array", "extensive tests", "frequency 787 GHz to 950 GHz", "optical aperture", "production phase", "receiver preproduction phase", "receiver sensitivity", "secondary antenna", "Mirrors", "Mixers", "Noise", "Noise measurement", "Radio frequency", "Receivers", "Temperature measurement", "Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)", "SIS device (superconductor)", "niobium titanium nitride", "submillimeter-wave mixers", "waveguide coupler", ""], "arnumber": "6423869"}
