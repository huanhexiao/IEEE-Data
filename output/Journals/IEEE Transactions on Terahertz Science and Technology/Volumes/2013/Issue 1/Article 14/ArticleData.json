This technique treats an orthogonally astigmatic beam using skew Gaussian beam analysis, from which an anastigmatic imaging network is derived. The resultant beam is considered truly stigmatic, with all Gaussian beam parameters in the orthogonal directions being matched. This is thus considered an improvement over previous techniques wherein a beam corrected for astigmatism has only the orthogonal beam amplitude radii matched, with phase shift and phase radius of curvature not considered. This technique is computationally efficient, negating the requirement for computationally intensive numerical analysis of shaped reflector surfaces. The required optical surfaces are also relatively simple to implement compared to such numerically optimized shaped surfaces. This technique is implemented in this work as part of the complete optics train for the STEAMR antenna. The STEAMR instrument is envisaged as a mutli-beam limb sounding instrument operating at submillimeter wavelengths. The antenna optics arrangement for this instrument uses multiple off-axis reflectors to control the incident radiation and couple them to their corresponding receiver feeds. An anastigmatic imaging network is successfully implemented into an optical model of this antenna, and the resultant design ensures optimal imaging of the beams to the corresponding feed horns. This example also addresses the challenges of imaging in multi-beam antenna systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "110", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "119", "date_publication": "Thu Dec 27 00:00:00 EST 2012", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13287395", "date": "Jan. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "1", "pages": "110 - 119", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Mark Whale", "Anthony Murphy", "Axel Murk", "Matthias Renker", "Urban Frisk", "Olle Janson"], "keywords": ["aberrations", "focal planes", "optical elements", "submillimetre wave antennas", "submillimetre wave imaging", "STEAMR antenna", "STEAMR instrument", "anastigmatic imaging network", "anastigmatic submillimeter array imaging system", "antenna optics arrangement", "astigmatic off-axis reflectors", "astigmatism removal", "feed horns", "multibeam antenna systems", "mutlibeam limb sounding instrument", "orthogonally astigmatic beam", "phase radius", "phase shift", "shaped reflector surfaces", "skew Gaussian beam analysis", "submillimeter wave optical systems", "Adaptive optics", "Apertures", "Optical imaging", "Structural beams", "ABCD matrices", "Gaussian beams", "STEAMR", "anastigmatic", "astigmatic", "multi-beam", "quasi-optical", ""], "arnumber": "6395795"}
