The waveguide design maximizes the fraction of power guided in the air to reduce waveguide loss due to material absorption, as well as to provide a conveniently accessible microfluidic channels for sensor measurements.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "96", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "102", "date_publication": "Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13287399", "date": "Jan. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "1", "pages": "96 - 102", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Andrey Markov", "Anna Mazhorova", "Maksim Skorobogatiy"], "keywords": ["dielectric waveguides", "measurement systems", "microfluidics", "planar waveguides", "sensors", "THz spectral range", "deeply subwavelength air-dielectric bilayers", "low-loss guidance applications", "material absorption", "microfluidic channels", "periodic sequence", "planar porous THz waveguides", "planar porous dielectric waveguides", "sensor measurements", "waveguide design", "Absorption", "Dispersion", "Optical waveguides", "Planar waveguides", "Polyethylene", "Slabs", "Frequency domain", "numerical modeling", "terahertz (THz)", "waveguides", ""], "arnumber": "6413267"}
