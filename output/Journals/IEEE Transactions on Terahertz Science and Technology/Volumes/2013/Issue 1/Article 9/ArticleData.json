The method as explained is intuitive, easy to implement, and has proven itself to be a useful tool in the avoidance of problems associated with trapped modes prior to fabrication, as well as to correct those problems in designs where this design detail was overlooked.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "72", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "80", "date_publication": "Mon Jan 28 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13287403", "date": "Jan. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "1", "pages": "72 - 80", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Matthew A.
