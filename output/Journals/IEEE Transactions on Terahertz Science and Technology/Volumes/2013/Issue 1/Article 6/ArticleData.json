This degradation has its origin in the reflection the beam suffers when going through the filters and window. The cause and mechanism of this degradation were identified using THz-TDS and simple analysis techniques and a simple solution was found. The proposed solution is based on corrugated horns with chamfered rims and Terahertz absorber paint applied around the horns. This solution proves efficient in keeping the original optical performance when the optics is used in real operation at cryogenic temperature.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "50", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "55", "date_publication": "Wed Jan 16 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13287401", "date": "Jan. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "1", "pages": "50 - 55", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Alvaro Gonzalez", "Yoshinori Uzawa", "Keiko Kaneko", "Shingo Saito", "Yasunori Fujii"], "keywords": ["cryostats", "microwave photonics", "mirrors", "optical arrays", "optical design techniques", "optical filters", "optical windows", "reflection", "terahertz waves", "ALMA band 10 optics", "Atacama large millimeter-submillimeter array", "THz-TDS method", "beam reflection", "chamfered rims", "corrugated horns", "cryogenic temperature", "cryostat window", "infrared filters", "mirrors", "optical design techniques", "terahertz absorber paint", "Apertures", "Extraterrestrial measurements", "Optical variables measurement", "Optics", "Paints", "Temperature measurement", "Transmission line measurements", "Atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array", "Gaussian beams", "submillimeter-wave measurements", "submillimeter-wave technology", ""], "arnumber": "6413303"}
