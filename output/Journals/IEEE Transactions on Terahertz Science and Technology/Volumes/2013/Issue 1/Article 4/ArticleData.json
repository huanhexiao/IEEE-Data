The new design employs fully integrated circuit components onto a 15 \u03bcm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate, hence greatly simplifying the balanced mixer block requirements. Independent testing of the on-chip RF quadrature hybrid and the DC/IF blocks showed performances consistence with the computational predictions. The fabricated mixer chip tests have also demonstrated successful operation in balanced mixing mode as the LO noise was separated from the IF output. Preliminary tests of the device's sensitivity gave a best double sideband (DSB) noise temperature of 714 K measured at 635 GHz, and remained at a similar level throughout the operating frequency band. The higher than expected noise temperature was mainly caused by a significant shift in the junction position during fabrication, in both the longitudinal and lateral directions, resulting in substantial shift in the tuning frequency and degradation in the coupling of power to the junction.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "32", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "38", "date_publication": "Tue Jan 15 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13287398", "date": "Jan. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "1", "pages": "32 - 38", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Boon-Kok Tan", "Ghassan Yassin", "Paul Grimes", "Karl Jacobs", "Stafford Withington"], "keywords": ["broadband networks", "integrated circuit noise", "integrated circuit testing", "silicon-on-insulator", "submillimetre wave integrated circuits", "submillimetre wave measurement", "submillimetre wave mixers", "superconducting integrated circuits", "tuning", "DC-IF blocks", "DSB noise temperature", "IF output", "LO noise", "SOI substrate", "back-to-back unilateral finline tapers", "balanced mixer block requirements", "balanced mixing mode", "best double sideband noise temperature", "broadband balanced SIS mixer", "computational predictions", "fabricated mixer chip testing", "frequency 635 GHz", "frequency 650 GHz", "fully integrated circuit components", "junction position", "lateral directions", "longitudinal directions", "on-chip RF quadrature hybrid testing", "planar circuit balanced SIS mixer", "power coupling degradation", "silicon-on-insulator substrate", "size 15 mum", "temperature 714 K", "tuning frequency shift", "Junctions", "Microstrip", "Mixers", "Noise", "Radio frequency", "Semiconductor device measurement", "System-on-a-chip", "Superconducting integrated circuits", "mixers", "silicon-on-insulator (SOI) technology", "submillimeter-wave devices", "system-on-a-chip", ""], "arnumber": "6412820"}
