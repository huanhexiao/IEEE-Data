The characteristics of the guided modes of this structure which belong to the category of spoof surface plasmons are studied using the generalized multipole technique and its potential applications are discussed. Moreover, the proposed structure is experimentally investigated in a THz time-domain spectroscopy system and a comparison between the calculated and measured amplitude and phase characteristics is given. It is shown that the dominant mode of the PPLWG can be excited by an incident focused beam and a high degree of field confinement in the THz regime can be achieved.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "87", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "95", "date_publication": "Tue Jan 01 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13287396", "date": "Jan. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "1", "pages": "87 - 95", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Mehdi Ahmadi-Boroujeni", "Kristian Altmann", "Benedikt Scherger", "Christian Jansen", "Mahmoud Shahabadi", "Martin Koch"], "keywords": ["ladder networks", "parallel plate waveguides", "surface plasmons", "PPLWG", "THz time-domain spectroscopy system", "THz wave", "amplitude", "field confinement", "focused beam", "generalized multipole technique", "highly confined guided mode", "phase characteristics", "spoof surface plasmon", "terahertz parallel-plate ladder waveguide", "Arrays", "Attenuation", "Bandwidth", "Metals", "Periodic structures", "Plasmons", "Surface waves", "Modal analysis", "parallel-plate waveguides (PPWGs)", "periodic structures", "plasmonics", "terahertz (THz) components", ""], "arnumber": "6400275"}
