Clear differences are observed between the absorption spectra of crystalline and amorphous PHB, indicating that the higher order conformation of PHB determines the THz spectra. The THz polarization spectra are measured for a stretched PHB sample and the directions of the vibrational transition moments are determined. The spectra are found to have temperature dependences owing to which the peaks at lower frequencies shift with temperature, suggesting a large anharmonicity of the vibrational potential. To investigate low frequency vibrational modes more thoroughly, low-frequency Raman spectra are also measured for crystalline PHB. The observed vibrational modes in both THz and Raman spectra were successfully assigned by a quantum mechanical simulation of spectra with the Cartesian coordinate tensor transfer (CCT) method, which can provide realistic spectra of the PHB by considering the intermolecular interactions among polymer chains. The potential of CCT for the assignment of THz spectra is demonstrated. On the basis of these results, the structural change in PHB is studied. The isothermal crystallization of PHB is monitored with the help of THz absorption spectra. The observed spectra clearly show the crystal growth, and the crystallization rate is estimated by Avrami's model. Next, the isothermal crystallization spectra are analyzed using two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS). By using the synchronous and asynchronous data plots, the correlation between the absorption peaks and the temporal order of the changes in spectral intensity is determined.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "248", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "258", "date_publication": "Thu Apr 11 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13475397", "date": "May 2013", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 29 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "3", "pages": "248 - 258", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Hiromichi Hoshina", "Shinya Ishii", "Shigeki Yamamoto", "Yusuke Morisawa", "Harumi Sato", "Tetsuji Uchiyama", "Yukihiro Ozaki", "Chiko Otani"], "keywords": ["Raman spectra", "absorption coefficients", "crystal growth", "crystallisation", "polymer structure", "quantum theory", "terahertz wave spectra", "vibrational modes", "2DCOS", "Avrami's model", "CCT method", "THz absorption spectra", "THz frequency region", "THz polarization spectra", "absorption peaks", "absorption spectra", "amorphous poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)", "asynchronous data plots", "cartesian coordinate tensor transfer method", "crystal growth", "crystalline poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)", "high order conformation", "intermolecular vibrational modes", "isothermal crystallization spectra", "large anharmonicity", "low frequency shift", "low frequency vibrational modes", "low-frequency Raman spectra", "polymer chains", "quantum mechanical simulation", "spectral intensity", "stretched PHB sample", "structural characterization", "temperature dependences", "terahertz frequency region", "terahertz spectroscopy", "two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy", "vibrational potential", "vibrational transition moments", "Isothermal crystallization", "low-frequency Raman spectroscopy", "poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)", "polymer", "quantum mechanical simulation", "terahertz spectroscopy", "two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS)", ""], "arnumber": "6496184"}
