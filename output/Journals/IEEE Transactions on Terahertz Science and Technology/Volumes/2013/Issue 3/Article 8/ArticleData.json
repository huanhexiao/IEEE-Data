The method, takes advantages of both transmission and reflection terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) to obtain more precise optical constants than when only reflection measurement is used. It has been then validated using pellets made of maltose, which exhibits resonant lines within the THz spectral range.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "295", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "301", "date_publication": "Mon Mar 11 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13475394", "date": "May 2013", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 29 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "3", "pages": "295 - 301", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Maxime Bernier", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Garet", "Jean-Louis Coutaz"], "keywords": ["absorption coefficients", "organic compounds", "reflection", "refractive index", "terahertz wave spectra", "visible spectra", "absorption coefficient", "low-transmission bands", "maltose", "optical constants", "pellets", "precise determination", "reflection measurement", "reflection terahertz time-domain spectroscopy", "refractive index", "Absorption", "Data mining", "Frequency measurement", "Materials", "Mirrors", "Phase measurement", "Refractive index", "Material characterization", "THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS)", "reflection spectroscopy", "transmission spectroscopy", ""], "arnumber": "6477199"}
