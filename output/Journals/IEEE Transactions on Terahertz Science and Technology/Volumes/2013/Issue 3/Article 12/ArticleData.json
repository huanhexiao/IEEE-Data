We use Raman spectroscopy to determine the degree of crystallinity of the annealed surfaces, and investigate the dependence on crystallinity and fabrication method of the photoconductivity. Time-resolved THz spectroscopy is used to determine the evolution of the carrier scattering time and confinement of carriers on the picosecond time scale. We conclude that a fabrication method with high energy leading edge of the annealing laser results in black silicon with the largest photon-to-electron conversion efficiency, largest mobility, and longest carrier lifetime.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "331", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "341", "date_publication": "Tue Apr 23 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13475403", "date": "May 2013", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 29 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "3", "pages": "331 - 341", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Henrik P.
