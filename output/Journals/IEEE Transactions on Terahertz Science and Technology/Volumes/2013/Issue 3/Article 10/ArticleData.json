However, the multiplied sources must be carefully characterized. Characterization requires band-wide measurements of power levels and harmonic content, as well as understanding any spurious behavior. Also, simple bias schemes, and acceptable input power levels that eliminate spurious behavior, support long term reliability, and result in repeatable performance are critical in spectroscopic applications. The fully characterized source may then be useful for both narrow-band high sensitivity integrations, or for band-wide surveys. Coupling the source with various gas-handling systems enables valuable new spectroscopic measurements that improve upon techniques such as Tunable Far-Infrared spectroscopy, Laser-sideband spectroscopy, and photomixer based spectroscopy.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "314", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "321", "date_publication": "Fri Apr 12 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13475398", "date": "May 2013", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 29 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "3", "pages": "314 - 321", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Brian J.
