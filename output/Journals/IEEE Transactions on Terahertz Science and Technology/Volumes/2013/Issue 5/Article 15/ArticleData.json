Microthermal absorption has been characterized and a worst-case analysis has been done to provide thresholds for the tissue-internal electric field strength at THz frequencies. Dielectric models for the skin and the cornea of the eye as exposed surface tissues have been constructed and used to estimate the corresponding thresholds for incident power densities. The findings of this study shall be useful as a new theoretical framework for future studies related to THz radiation safety and regulation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "635", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "640", "date_publication": "Mon Jun 10 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13795012", "date": "Sept. 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 20 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "5", "pages": "635 - 640", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Mehrdad Saviz", "Oliver Spathmann", "Joachim Streckert", "Volkert Hansen", "Markus Clemens", "Reza Faraji-Dana"], "keywords": ["eye", "medical image processing", "skin", "terahertz waves", "THz band", "THz radiation regulation", "THz radiation safety", "cornea", "dielectric models", "eye", "frequency 100 GHz to 10 THz", "microthermal absorption", "power density", "skin", "surface tissues", "terahertz exposure", "tissue-internal electric field strength", "worst-case analysis", "Absorption", "Cornea", "Density measurement", "Permittivity", "Power system measurements", "Safety", "Skin", "Biological effects of radiation", "microthermal effects", "radiation safety", "terahertz (THz)", ""], "arnumber": "6528026"}
