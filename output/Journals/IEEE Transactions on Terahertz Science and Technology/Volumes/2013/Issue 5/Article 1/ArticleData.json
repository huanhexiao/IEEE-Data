Dr. Keilmann has explored many areas and applications in infrared physics and spectroscopy. His interests were always focused in the infrared, but he was often drawn into biochemistry and biophysics, where he initially worked on molecular spectroscopy of biomolecules and later on microwave effects on cell systems. Today, he is focusing on understanding the basic structure, evolution and impact of mineralization in osteoporosis. Dr. Keilmann also worked extensively on high power laser sources, especially optically pumped IR lasers and their applications for plasma science and nonlinear solid-state spectroscopy. He is credited with inventing the scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscope, the nano-FTIR, and the dual-frequency-comb spectrometer. These instruments have had a broad impact on nanoscience and have reached into areas as diverse as molecular biology, space science, and quantum chemistry. He has published more than 150 peer reviewed papers, holds 14 patents, and has contributed to five textbooks. He is an internationally recognized speaker and has given more than a hundred invited presentations at workshops, conferences and seminars. He is a recipient of the 2009 Kenneth J Button Prize. He resides south of Munich, Germany and is looking forward to continued development and applications of his nanoscopy techniques.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "506", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "514", "date_publication": "Fri Aug 30 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "date": "Sept. 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 20 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "5", "pages": "506 - 514", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Peter H.
