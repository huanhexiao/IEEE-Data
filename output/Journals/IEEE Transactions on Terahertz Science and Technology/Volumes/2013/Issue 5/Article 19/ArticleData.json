A novel numerical approach, based on graphene surface impedance, hyper-singular integral equations, and the Nystrom method, is proposed. This technique guarantees fast convergence and controlled accuracy of computations. Reflectance, transmittance, and absorbance are carefully studied as a function of graphene and grating parameters, revealing the presence of surface plasmon resonances. Specifically, larger graphene relaxation times increases the number of resonances in the THz range, leading to higher wave transmittance due to the reduced losses; on the other hand an increase of graphene chemical potential up-shifts the frequency of plasmon resonances. It is also shown that a relatively low number of graphene strips ( >10) are able to reproduce Rayleigh anomalies. These features make graphene strips good candidates for many applications, including tunable absorbers and frequency selective surfaces.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "666", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "674", "date_publication": "Wed Jun 05 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13795017", "date": "Sept. 2013", "date_current_version": "Mon Sep 23 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "5", "pages": "666 - 674", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Olga V.
