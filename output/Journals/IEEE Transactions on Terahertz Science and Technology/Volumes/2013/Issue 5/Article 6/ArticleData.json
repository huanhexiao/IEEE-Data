Propagation of a broadband pulse of EM waves in 0.5-10 THz is studied by using finite difference time-domain (FDTD) approach. The results show that plasmonic modes excited by incident THz radiation are concentrated into \u03bb/180 area localized under the central disc. Electric field intensity under the central point is found to be orders of magnitude larger than the outer grating area. Optimal geometries for enhanced radiation coupling and plasmon focusing are investigated. Plasmonic lens modes supported by system has the advantage of tunability by an applied voltage to gratings. The large field enhancement by plasmonic confinement presents the potential for sub-wavelength imaging.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "550", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "557", "date_publication": "Thu Aug 22 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13747624", "date": "Sept. 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Aug 23 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "5", "pages": "550 - 557", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Mustafa Karabiyik", "Chowdhury Al-Amin", "Nezih Pala"], "keywords": ["III-V semiconductors", "aluminium compounds", "finite difference time-domain analysis", "gallium compounds", "graphene", "plasmonics", "semiconductor heterojunctions", "terahertz wave devices", "two-dimensional electron gas", "wide band gap semiconductors", "2DEG", "AlGaN-GaN", "C", "EM waves", "FDTD approach", "III-N heterostructures", "THz radiation", "broadband pulse propagation", "central disc", "deep subwavelength multimode tunable in-plane plasmonic lenses", "electric field intensity", "finite difference time-domain approach", "graphene", "planar circular grating lenses", "plasmon focusing", "plasmonic confinement", "plasmonic lens modes", "radiation coupling", "subwavelength imaging", "terahertz frequency", "terahertz plasmons", "two-dimensional electron gas", "Graphene", "Gratings", "HEMTs", "Logic gates", "MODFETs", "Plasmons", "Resonant frequency", "Graphene", "plasmonics", "terahertz (THz)", ""], "arnumber": "6584822"}
