Transmission images are obtained by scanning the beam of the QCL across an object. Images with a diameter of approximately 40 mm and a signal-to-noise ratio of up to 28 dB were obtained within 1.1 s. The system was also used to obtain three-dimensional images of objects in an ellipsoidal volume with axes of approximately 40 mm by computed tomography within 87 s.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "617", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "624", "date_publication": "Tue Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13795011", "date": "Sept. 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 20 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "5", "pages": "617 - 624", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Nick Rothbart", "Heiko Richter", "Martin Wienold", "Lutz Schrottke", "Holger T.
