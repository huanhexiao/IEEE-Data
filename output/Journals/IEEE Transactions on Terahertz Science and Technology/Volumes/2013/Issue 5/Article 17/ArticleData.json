Dependencies of the resonance features on different sample parameters are evaluated via spectroscopic investigation of several energetic materials (TNT, C4, RDX, PETN, AN) in transmission and reflection experiments. A strong dependency of the resonance features on the manufacturing process of an explosive is observed especially with TNT. The THz measurements of the TNT samples are compared to powder X-ray diffraction measurements. Furthermore, it is observed that additive compounds with a flat frequency response offset the THz reflection of an explosive, but the recognition capability of a resonance feature is not influenced.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "649", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "655", "date_publication": "Thu Jun 20 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13795010", "date": "Sept. 2013", "date_current_version": "Mon Sep 23 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "5", "pages": "649 - 655", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Anna K.
