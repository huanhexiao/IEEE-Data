The simulation is based on a ray-casting approach including models for reflections at rough surfaces and angular antenna sensitivity. A near real-time GPU reconstruction is introduced to process large amounts of data in parallel. Techniques for fast fusion of reconstructed data from several acquisition directions are presented. They serve as basis to visualize a fully consistent 3-D object. The modular framework allows a fast, easy, and efficient evaluation and prediction of system properties including scattering behavior for these types of scanner setups.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "625", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "634", "date_publication": "Thu Sep 05 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13795026", "date": "Sept. 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 20 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "5", "pages": "625 - 634", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Martin P\u00e4tzold", "Matthias Kahl", "Thomas Klinkert", "Andreas Keil", "Torsten L\u00f6ffler", "Peter Haring Bol\u00edvar", "Andreas Kolb"], "keywords": ["graphics processing units", "image reconstruction", "rough surfaces", "synthetic aperture radar", "terahertz wave imaging", "3D configuration", "3D simulation", "THz-scattering", "acquisition directions", "angular antenna sensitivity", "data reconstruction", "data-processing framework", "full consistent 3D object", "graphics processing unit", "hybrid synthetic aperture THz systems", "mechanically scanned real imaging projection", "modular framework", "ray-casting approach", "real-time GPU reconstruction", "reconstruction functionalities", "rough surfaces", "scanner setups", "scattering behavior", "simulation framework", "synthetic imaging reconstruction", "Apertures", "Graphics processing units", "Image reconstruction", "Imaging", "Rough surfaces", "Scattering", "Surface roughness", "3-D visualization", "Configuration", "framework", "graphics processing unit (GPU)", "millimeter-wave", "personnel scanner", "real-time processing", "reconstruction", "scattering", "security system", "simulation", "terahertz (THz)", ""], "arnumber": "6589168"}
