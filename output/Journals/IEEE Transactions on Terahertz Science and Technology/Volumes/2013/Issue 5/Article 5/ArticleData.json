Traditional compact SPICE models used by commercial CAD tools model the channel resistance and capacitance and gate resistance as single lumped elements or use approximations to model the distributed nature of the FET channel. At high frequencies, these models become inaccurate and fail to model device physics properly. To describe plasmonic FETs, a THz SPICE model is developed for Si FETs. The THz SPICE model is validated experimentally to be in close agreement with measured results. The model is used to show predicted device response at different technology nodes.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "545", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "549", "date_publication": "Fri Jun 21 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13795025", "date": "Sept. 2013", "date_current_version": "Mon Sep 23 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "5", "pages": "545 - 549", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Alexey Gutin", "Shamsun Nahar", "Mona Hella", "Michael Shur"], "keywords": ["SPICE", "capacitance", "electric resistance", "elemental semiconductors", "field effect transistors", "plasmonics", "semiconductor device models", "silicon", "terahertz wave devices", "Si", "THz SPICE model", "capacitance", "channel resistance", "commercial CAD tools", "commercial circuit modeling", "complex circuits", "device response", "gate resistance", "single lumped elements", "terahertz plasmonic Si FET", "CMOS terahertz (THz) detection", "SPICE", "THz modeling", "patch antenna", ""], "arnumber": "6545392"}
