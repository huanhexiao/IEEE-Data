In this paper, \u201clarge area emitters\u201d (LAEs) are proposed as an alternative approach, and compared with AEAs. In this antenna-free new scheme of photomixing, the THz radiation originates directly from the acceleration of photo-induced charge carriers generated within a large semiconductor area. The quasi-continuous distribution of emitting elements corresponds to a high-density array and results in favorable radiation profiles without side lobes. Moreover, the achievable THz power is expected to outnumber even large AEAs. Last not least, the technological challenge of fabricating LAEs appears to be significantly less demanding.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "532", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "544", "date_publication": "Fri Jun 28 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13795016", "date": "Sept. 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 20 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "5", "pages": "532 - 544", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Gottfried H.
