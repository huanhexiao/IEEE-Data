Anharmonicity corrections were calculated using two different approaches. First, the perturbation theory-based first principle calculations were performed to include third- and fourth-order anharmonicity corrections in atomic displacements to harmonic vibrational states. Second, the atom-centered density matrix propagation molecular dynamics model that provides a good energy conservation was used to calculate the atomic trajectories, velocities, and a dipole moment time history of biotin at low and room temperatures. Predicted low-THz lines agree well with the experimental spectra. The influence of the polyethylene (PE) matrix embedment on the THz spectra of biotin at the nanoscale was studied using the developed hybrid DFT/molecular mechanical approach. While PE is almost transparent at THz frequencies, additional low-THz lines are predicted in the biotin/PE system, which reflects a dynamic interaction between biotin and a surrounding PE cavity.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "357", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "362", "date_publication": "July 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13599144", "date": "July 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 28 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "4", "pages": "357 - 362", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Alexei Bykhovski", "Dwight Woolard"], "keywords": ["ab initio calculations", "density functional theory", "enzymes", "molecular biophysics", "molecular dynamics method", "molecular moments", "perturbation theory", "terahertz wave spectra", "vibrational states", "THz absorption", "THz spectra", "atom-centered density matrix propagation molecular dynamics model", "atomic displacements", "atomic trajectories", "biotin", "density functional theory", "dipole moment time history", "energy conservation", "first principle simulations", "fourth-order anharmonicity corrections", "harmonic approximation", "harmonic vibrational states", "hybrid DFT/molecular mechanical approach", "hybrid simulations", "molecular mechanical simulations", "perturbation theory-based first principle calculations", "polyethylene matrix embedment", "predicted low-THz lines", "terahertz spectra", "third-order anharmonicity corrections", "velocities", "Biotin", "first principle", "hybrid", "terahertz (THZ)", ""], "arnumber": "6549202"}
