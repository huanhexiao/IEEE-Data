Known as microwave endometrial ablation (MEA), relevant procedure is used as an alternative to hysterectomy considering its safety, simplicity and effectiveness. In lieu of the prevailing MEA techniques, it is attempted in this study to foresee the possibility of conceiving an alternative and a newer option on endometrial ablation using mm-wave/THz frequencies. Commensurate with this motivated impetus, objectively considered are merits and design issues of using electromagnetic (EM) spectrum of mm-wave/THz region toward optimal conversion of EM energy into a thermal ablative source so that, the basal layer of endometrium can be effectively destroyed in surgical contexts as necessary. Hence, the feasibility of designing appropriate TEA applicators for controlled and safe procedures so as to ablate just the unwanted tissues within a localized zone of energy field is addressed. Lastly, a quantitative analysis on the interaction of THz EM-energy versus the lossy dielectric characteristics of endometrial medium is indicated to model the underlying (THz-energy)-to-(thermal energy) transduction. Relevant prospects of conceiving TEA and the associated pros and cons are identified specific to the prospects of feasibility, requirement considerations and technical challenges.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "402", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "408", "date_publication": "Mon Apr 15 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13599132", "date": "July 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 28 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "4", "pages": "402 - 408", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Perambur S.
