However, the situation has changed with the development of backward-wave oscillator (BWO) and BWO-based spectrometers. Packaged (30-180 GHz) and unpackaged (0.18-1.50 THz) BWOs are now being produced. The 0.18-1.50 THz frequency range is of greatest interest for spectroscopic research. To work with unpackaged BWOs, a universal magnetic focusing system on a permanent magnet with a protective housing shielding the magnetic field was developed. The stable generation of radiation with a frequency of up to 2.1 THz without geometry change was achieved. A universal automated power-supply unit with high-speed BWO frequency radiation scanning and a high degree of BWO electronic security was also designed for generating unpackaged BWOs through a heating and high cathode voltage.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "440", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "444", "date_publication": "Tue May 21 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13599141", "date": "July 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 28 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "4", "pages": "440 - 444", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Gennady A.
