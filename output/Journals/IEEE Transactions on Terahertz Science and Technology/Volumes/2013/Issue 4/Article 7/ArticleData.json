The proposed method first acquires data at random measurement points in the spatial domain, and estimates the regions in each tomographic image where much degradation is expected. Then, it allocates additional measurement points to those regions, so that more data are acquired adaptively at the regions prone to degradation, thereby improving the quality of the reconstructed tomographic images. The proposed method was applied to the T-ray reflection tomography system, and the image quality enhancement by the proposed method, compared to the conventional method, was verified for the same number of measurement points.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "395", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "401", "date_publication": "July 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13599143", "date": "July 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 28 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "4", "pages": "395 - 401", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Kijun Kim", "Dong-Gyu Lee", "Woo-Gyu Ham", "Jaseong Ku", "Sang-Hun Lee", "Chang-Beom Ahn", "Joo-Hiuk Son", "Hochong Park"], "keywords": ["compressed sensing", "computerised tomography", "data acquisition", "image enhancement", "image reconstruction", "terahertz wave imaging", "T-ray reflection tomography system", "adaptive compressed sensing", "data acquisition", "fast terahertz reflection tomography", "image quality enhancement", "random measurement point", "spatial domain analysis", "tomographic image reconstruction quality", "tomographic image region estimation", "Compressed sensing (CS)", "THz tomography", "tetrahertz (THz) imaging", ""], "arnumber": "6549175"}
