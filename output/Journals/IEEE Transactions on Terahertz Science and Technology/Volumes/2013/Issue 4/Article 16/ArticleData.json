The lines consist of two 0.4 mm (or 0.5 mm) diameter copper wires with centers separated by 1.0 mm. The air spaced two-wire lines show transform-limited TEM mode pulse propagation with very small group velocity dispersion (GVD), and relatively low attenuation. Our achieved performance with a power loss of 5.8 dB/m approaches that needed for mm-wave and THz interconnects. The coupling was enabled by two tungsten probes with 1 \u03bcm diameter tips in near-contact (5 \u03bcm gap) with the coplanar transmission lines on the transmitting and receiving optoelectronic chips. The air spaced two-wire line's relatively small, measured pulse amplitude attenuation coefficient was 1.31 times larger than the theoretical prediction for the TEM mode. This discrepancy is considered to be primarily due to reduction of the Cu conductivity in the THz skin-depth layer.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "453", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "460", "date_publication": "Fri Apr 05 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13599131", "date": "July 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 28 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "4", "pages": "453 - 460", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Jeong Sang Jo", "Tae-In Jeon", "Daniel R.
