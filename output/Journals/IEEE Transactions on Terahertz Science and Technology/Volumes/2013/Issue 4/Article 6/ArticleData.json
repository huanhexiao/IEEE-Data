In this study, we utilize terahertz imaging to study the effects of hydrofluoric acid on both compact bone tissue and cartilage. We compare the differences observed in the exposure for formalin fixed and raw, dried, tissue as well as those resulting from a change in hydrofluoric (HF) concentration. Measurements are performed with THz-TDS, and a variety of spectroscopic-based image reconstruction techniques are utilized to develop contrast in the features of interest.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "387", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "394", "date_publication": "July 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13599145", "date": "July 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 28 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "4", "pages": "387 - 394", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["William E.
