In this mixer layout, the three junctions are connected together by passive network elements, such that each junction is subjected to different local oscillator (LO) drive, and slightly different DC bias voltages. This design helps to reduce the output capacitance of the mixer at the intermediate frequency (IF) so as to achieve a wider IF bandwidth, while maintaining adequate RF bandwidth. The receiver performance of this type of mixer was evaluated in the 220 GHz band. The lowest noise temperature measured was ~30 K, and the noise temperature remains below 50 K over the IF range from 3 to 11 GHz. Receivers incorporating this new mixer design are currently in routine operation at the Submillimeter Array.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "428", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "432", "date_publication": "Wed May 15 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13599139", "date": "July 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 28 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "4", "pages": "428 - 432", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Cheuk-Yu Edward Tong", "Paul Grimes", "Raymond Blundell", "Ming-Jye Wang", "Takashi Noguchi"], "keywords": ["millimetre wave mixers", "millimetre wave receivers", "superconducting arrays", "superconducting microwave devices", "superconductor-insulator-superconductor mixers", "DC bias voltages", "IF bandwidth", "LO drive", "SIS mixer", "frequency 220 GHz", "frequency 3 GHz to 11 GHz", "intermediate frequency", "local oscillator drive", "mixer layout", "noise temperature", "passive network elements", "series distributed SIS junction array", "submillimeter array", "supercon-ductor-insulator-superconductor junction", "wideband SIS receivers", "Distributed mixers", "submillimeter receivers", "superconductor&#x2013", "insulator&#x2013", "superconductor (SIS) mixers", "ultra wideband receivers", ""], "arnumber": "6516592"}
