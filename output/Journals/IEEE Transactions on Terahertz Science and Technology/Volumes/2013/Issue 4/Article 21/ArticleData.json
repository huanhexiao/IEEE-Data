Typically photo-induced changes in the transmission of the peak of the THz waveform are recorded and thought to represent the real conductivity dynamics. Here we evaluate a time-domain scheme that accesses both the real and imaginary conductivity dynamics by recording the photo-induced change in the transmitted THz pulse at its peak and its zero-crossing, respectively. The applicability and limitations of this method are investigated by modeling the THz response of material systems with known conductivity dynamics. The relationship between measured time-domain dynamics and the actual charge carrier dynamics is discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "494", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "498", "date_publication": "Fri May 03 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13599137", "date": "July 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 28 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "4", "pages": "494 - 498", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Paul D.
