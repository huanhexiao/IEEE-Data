A malignant nodule beneath the oral tissue surface was visualized using 2-D and B-scan THz imaging techniques. The THz images were well correlated with the histological findings. The nodule was found to have lower water content than that of normal cells, and this water effect may have influenced the THz refractive index and absorption coefficient at 20 \u00b0C. The THz spectroscopic image of the frozen tissue at -20 \u00b0C showed better contrast because of the lack of liquid water; this implies that there are significant structural differences between malignant oral melanoma cells and normal mucosal cells. The better contrast in the frozen tissue images was due to the greater penetration of THz radiation into the sample. This temperature-dependent THz imaging approach demonstrated the feasibility of accurate imaging of the oral tumor tissue.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "368", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "373", "date_publication": "July 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13599146", "date": "July 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 28 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "4", "pages": "368 - 373", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Yookyeong Carolyn Sim", "Kang-Min Ahn", "Jae Yeon Park", "Chan-Sik Park", "Joo-Hiuk Son"], "keywords": ["absorption coefficients", "cancer", "cellular biophysics", "dentistry", "medical image processing", "refractive index", "spectrochemical analysis", "terahertz wave imaging", "tumours", "2D THz imaging technique", "B-scan THz imaging technique", "THz radiation penetration", "THz refractive index", "THz spectroscopic image", "absorption coefficient", "excised oral malignant melanoma", "frozen tissue", "frozen tissue image contrast", "histological findings", "malignant nodule", "malignant oral melanoma cells", "normal cells", "normal mucosal cells", "oral tissue surface", "oral tumor tissue", "tempera-turedependent THz imaging approach", "temperature -20 degC", "temperature 293 K to 298 K", "temperature-dependent terahertz imaging", "terahertz reflection imaging", "water content", "Medical imaging", "terahertz (THz) imaging", "terahertz radiation", ""], "arnumber": "6549217"}
