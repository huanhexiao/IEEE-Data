The flexible MMs, consisting of electric split-ring resonators (eSRRs) on patterned GaAs patches, were fabricated on a thin polyimide layer using a transfer technique. Optical excitation of the GaAs patches modifies the metamaterial response. Our experimental results revealed that, with increasing fluence, a transmission modulation depth of ~ 60% was achieved at the LC resonant frequency of 0.98 THz. In addition, a similar modulation depth was obtained over a broad range from 1.1 to 1.8 THz. Numerical simulations agree with experiment and indicate efficient tuning of the effective permittivity of the MMs. Our flexible tunable device paves the way to create multilayer nonplanar tunable electromagnetic composites for nonlinear and multifunctional applications, including sensing, modulation, and energy harvesting.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "702", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "708", "date_publication": "Wed Oct 30 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13918095", "date": "Nov. 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Nov 22 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "6", "pages": "702 - 708", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Kebin Fan", "Xiaoguang Zhao", "Jingdi Zhang", "Kun Geng", "George R.
