Through equivalent circuit models, electromagnetic simulations, and experiments, it is shown that, while a pair of SRRs coupled to a PGL inhibits the propagation of surface waves along the line, introducing a capacitive gap to the PGL switches the bandstop behavior to a bandpass behavior. In order to highlight the potential application of the proposed structure to the design of practical higher order terahertz bandpass filters, two types of compact bandpass filters are designed and fabricated: 1) third-order periodic bandpass filters based on SRR/gap-loaded PGL and 2) coupled-resonator bandpass filters. It is shown that, while the frequency response of the both filter types can be controlled by altering the physical dimensions of the structure, a wider bandwidth can be achieved from the coupled-resonator filters. The design concept and simulation results are validated through experiments.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "851", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "858", "date_publication": "Wed Oct 30 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13918089", "date": "Nov. 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Nov 22 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "6", "pages": "851 - 858", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Ali K.
