The devices were fabricated to validate the model and experimental measurements were shown to be in good agreement with the simulated results. This absorber device is suitable for future use in THz sensing and detection applications.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "846", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "850", "date_publication": "Fri Nov 08 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13918086", "date": "Nov. 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Nov 22 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "6", "pages": "846 - 850", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["David Shawn Wilbert", "Mohammad Parvinnezhad Hokmabadi", "Patrick Kung", "Seongsin Margaret Kim"], "keywords": ["electromagnetic wave absorption", "equivalent circuits", "finite element analysis", "terahertz metamaterials", "equivalent circuit electric model", "finite element numerical method", "polarization insensitive metamaterial perfect absorbers", "polarization insensitive performance", "polarization insensitivity", "terhertz metamaterial absorbers", "Conductivity", "Frequency selective surfaces", "Metamaterials", "Polarization", "Resonant frequency", "Frequency selective surface", "metamaterials", "perfect absorber", "polarization independent", "reflection", "resonance", "terahertz (THz)", ""], "arnumber": "6658946"}
