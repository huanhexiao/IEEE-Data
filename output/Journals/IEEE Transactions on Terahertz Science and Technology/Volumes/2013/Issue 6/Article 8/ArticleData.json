The multilayered graphene-dielectric structure can be considered an effectively homogeneous metamaterial with an hyperbolic dispersion and anisotropic permittivity. Surface plasmonic waves are excited on graphene layers and the incident waves of different frequencies are absorbed at different levels of the stacked pyramid, due to the squeezing effect of the slow waves at the tapered waveguide. An absorption dip is observed and explained physically, and finally removed by adding a rectangular portion to the pyramid unit cell. High absorption with an extremely broad bandwidth from 8 THz to over 100 THz is achieved. The absorption spectrum of the present structure can be scaled down to a lower frequency (e.g. 2 THz) by increasing the size of the unit cell.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "757", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "763", "date_publication": "Thu Oct 17 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13918085", "date": "Nov. 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Nov 22 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "6", "pages": "757 - 763", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Sailing He", "Tuo Chen"], "keywords": ["broadband networks", "optical dispersion", "optical metamaterials", "permittivity", "terahertz wave devices", "anisotropic permittivity", "broadband THz absorbers", "graphene-based anisotropic metamaterial films", "graphene-dielectric multilayered frustum pyramids", "homogeneous metamaterial", "hyperbolic dispersion", "metal sheet", "Dielectrics", "Dispersion", "Electromagnetic waveguides", "Graphene", "Metamaterials", "Permittivity", "Absorber", "broadband", "graphene", "hyperbolic dispersion", "metamaterials", "scalable", "slow light", "terahertz (THz)", ""], "arnumber": "6631483"}
