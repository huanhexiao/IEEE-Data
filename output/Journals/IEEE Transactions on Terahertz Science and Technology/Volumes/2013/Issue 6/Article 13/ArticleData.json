It has been shown that the mixing processes in magnetoactive semiconductor structures are enhanced by the magnetic bias and the combinations of layer physical and geometrical parameters. The effects of magnetic bias on nonreciprocity of combinatorial frequency generation are discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "798", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "804", "date_publication": "Fri Nov 01 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13918082", "date": "Nov. 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Nov 22 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "6", "pages": "798 - 804", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Oksana V.
