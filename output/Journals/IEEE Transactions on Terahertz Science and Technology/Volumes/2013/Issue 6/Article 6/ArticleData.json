The thickness of the antenna is miniaturized, within the fabrication limits, by using the transverse slot resonance rather than the longitudinal resonance. Square and triangular corrugations are discussed. The comparison between these two profiles shows that, in terms of return loss and gain, the antenna is robust to the corrugation shape, which alleviates the fabrication complexity. The temporal analysis of the Bull's eye antenna is also shown to demonstrate the contributions coming from the leakage of the surface wave at each groove. This insight allows us to engineer the temporal shape of the output pulse by varying independently the depth of each groove. The antennas presented here hold promise for manipulating with very low profiles pulse- and beam-shapes of THz radiation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "740", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "747", "date_publication": "Mon Nov 11 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13918081", "date": "Nov. 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Nov 22 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "6", "pages": "740 - 747", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Miguel Beruete", "Unai Beaskoetxea", "Mokhtar Zehar", "Amit Agrawal", "Shuchang Liu", "Karine Blary", "Abdallah Chahadih", "Xiang-Lei Han", "Miguel Navarro-C\u00eda", "David Etayo Salinas", "Ajay Nahata", "Tahsin Akalin", "Mario Sorolla Ayza"], "keywords": ["leaky wave antennas", "terahertz wave devices", "terahertz waves", "bulls-eye antennas", "fabrication complexity", "leaky wave antennas", "one-dimensional and two-dimensional corrugated antennas", "square corrugations", "terahertz corrugated", "transverse slot resonance", "triangular corrugations", "Antenna measurements", "Apertures", "Corrugated surfaces", "Fabrication", "Metamaterials", "Surface waves", "Corrugated surfaces", "leaky-wave antennas", "subwavelength aperture", "time-domain spectroscopy", "very low profile feeder", ""], "arnumber": "6661458"}
