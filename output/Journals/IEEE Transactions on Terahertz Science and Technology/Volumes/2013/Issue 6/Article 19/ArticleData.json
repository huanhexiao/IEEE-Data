The indicated device converts an incoming submilimeter wavelength signal into a 1-5 GHz intermediate frequency (IF) signal by mixing it with a subharmonic LO signal. The mixer consists of a dual-band receiver and two coplanar stripline (CPS) filters, collocated on top of a three-dimensional (3-D) EBG structure. A four-element array of the proposed receivers was designed, fabricated and tested. The configuration demonstrated reasonable performance: conversion loss below 8 dB and noise temperature below 3000 K. The presented concept can be used for higher frequencies, provided the availability of sufficiently powerful LO sources.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "838", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "845", "date_publication": "Thu Nov 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13918098", "date": "Nov. 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Nov 22 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "6", "pages": "838 - 845", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Irina Khromova", "Ram\u00f3n Gonzalo", "I\u00f1igo Ederra", "Nicolas Delhote", "Dominique Baillargeat", "Axel Murk", "Byron E.
