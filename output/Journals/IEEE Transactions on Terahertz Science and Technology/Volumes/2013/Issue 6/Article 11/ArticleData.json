In this invited paper, we present a discussion on controlling the metamaterial properties by active and passive manipulation of near field coupling in an array of split ring resonators. We show that near field coupling between the meta-atoms could lead to resonance tuning, mode splitting, and ultrafast switching in passive and active resonators. The near field coupling schemes discussed here demonstrate the application possibilities of such structures towards the design of active switches, amplitude modulators, frequency agile behaviors, and slow light devices, particularly for the terahertz frequency regime, which still suffers from the shortage of practical devices required to bridge the so called \u201cTHz gap\u201d.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "783", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "790", "date_publication": "Wed Nov 06 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13918092", "date": "Nov. 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Nov 22 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "6", "pages": "783 - 790", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Dibakar Roy Chowdhury", "Abul K.
