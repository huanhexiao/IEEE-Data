It arises from the destructive interference between a bright continuum mode and a discrete dark mode. Metamaterials and plasmonics have facilitated the observation of Fano resonances in the realm of classical electrodynamics and have spurred intense interest to study and to exploit their peculiarities due their low loss and very sharp resonant features. Here, we survey the excitation of Fano resonance at terahertz frequencies by using asymmetric metamaterial structures. In particular, we discuss the high Q of Fano resonances, their sensitivity to the asymmetry parameter and potential applications. We believe that the manipulation of terahertz radiation by exploiting Fano resonances in terahertz metamaterials could usher in next-generation terahertz photonic devices for delay, storage, filtering, sensing, and nonlinear applications.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "820", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "826", "date_publication": "Wed Oct 30 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13918083", "date": "Nov. 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Nov 22 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "6", "pages": "820 - 826", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Ranjan Singh", "Ibraheem Al-Naib", "Wei Cao", "Carsten Rockstuhl", "Martin Koch", "Weili Zhang"], "keywords": ["Q-factor", "microwave photonics", "optical metamaterials", "plasmonics", "terahertz metamaterials", "terahertz wave spectra", "Fano resonance", "asymmetric line shape", "asymmetric metamaterial structures", "asymmetry parameter", "bright continuum mode", "classical electrodynamics", "delay application", "destructive interference", "discrete dark mode", "filtering application", "next-generation terahertz photonic devices", "nonlinear application", "plasmonics", "sensing application", "spectral characteristics", "storage application", "symmetry broken terahertz metamaterials", "terahertz frequency", "terahertz radiation", "Magnetic materials", "Metamaterials", "Optical sensors", "Photonics", "Plasmons", "Resonant frequency", "Fano resonance", "high <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$Q$</tex> </formula>-factor resonance", "low loss", "metamaterials", "plasmonics", "symmetry breaking", "terahertz", ""], "arnumber": "6650024"}
