After a short introduction to common design concepts, near-field measurements are presented to discuss the resonant coupling and excitation mechanisms. High- Q-factor metasurfaces based on symmetric and asymmetric resonators, characterized by far-field transmission measurements, are discussed including structures with trapped and high-order resonance modes. Numerical simulations of the current distributions inside the metaatoms give insight into the resonance mechanisms. The novel structures discussed here offer intriguing properties and have potential applications in design and development of filters, thin-film sensors, and slow-light devices.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "772", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "782", "date_publication": "Mon Nov 11 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13918087", "date": "Nov. 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Nov 22 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "6", "pages": "772 - 782", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Ibraheem Al-Naib", "Christian Jansen", "Ranjan Singh", "Markus Walther", "Martin Koch"], "keywords": ["optical couplers", "optical filters", "optical metamaterials", "terahertz waves", "THz metamaterial designs", "excitation mechanisms", "far-field coupling", "far-field transmission measurements", "filters", "high-Q resonances", "high-Q-factor metasurfaces", "near-field coupling", "near-field measurements", "resonant coupling", "sharp resonances", "slow-light devices", "thin-film sensors", "Couplings", "Magnetic moments", "Magnetic resonance", "Metamaterials", "Optical resonators", "Asymmetric resonance", "coupling effects", "filters", "metamaterials (MTMs)", "periodic structures", "quality factor", "sensors", "terahertz (THz) spectroscopy", ""], "arnumber": "6661459"}
