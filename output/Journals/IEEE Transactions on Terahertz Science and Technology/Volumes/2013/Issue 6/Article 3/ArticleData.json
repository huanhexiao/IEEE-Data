Experimental results reveal an anomalous increase in the resonance strength while the sample is illuminated near the edge of the metamaterial array with a finite-size terahertz beam. A re-radiation signal at the fundamental metamaterial resonance is observed on the transmission side of the total internal reflection interface where no signal was expected. Multiple theoretical approaches address the physical origins of this re-radiation signal and rich behavior has been simulated with numeric simulations. Although models indicate that surface waves could exist, radiation coupled across the total internal reflection surface appears predominately mediated by finite currents oscillating in resonators at the edge of the metafilm array. The observations could lead to a better understanding of boundary effects in finite, planar metamaterials and more accurate modeling of MM-mediated total reflection spectroscopy.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "709", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "720", "date_publication": "Mon Nov 04 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13918090", "date": "Nov. 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Nov 22 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "6", "pages": "709 - 720", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Suchitra Ramani", "Matthew T.
