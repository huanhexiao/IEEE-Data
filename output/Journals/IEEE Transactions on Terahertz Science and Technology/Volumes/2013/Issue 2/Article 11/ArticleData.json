The gate NDC can be realized in a resonant tunnel diode (RTD) gate structure integrated in the HEMT. Though the electron plasma wave by itself cannot enable amplification, when coupled with gate NDC, they together form a gain medium at terahertz (THz) frequencies due to the higher plasma wave group velocity than the electron drift velocity. The analysis is developed using a distributed circuit model based on the Dyakonov-Shur hydrodynamic theory. Numerical and analytical results suggest that these devices can realize power amplification with a gain exceeding 5 dB while simultaneously providing conditional stability at THz frequencies.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "200", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "206", "date_publication": "Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13355407", "date": "March 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "2", "pages": "200 - 206", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Berardi Sensale-Rodriguez", "Lei Liu", "Patrick Fay", "Debdeep Jena", "Huili Grace Xing"], "keywords": ["amplification", "electric admittance", "high electron mobility transistors", "numerical analysis", "plasma waves", "resonant tunnelling diodes", "semiconductor device models", "terahertz wave devices", "Dyakonov-Shur hydrodynamic theory", "RTD gate structure", "RTD-gated HEMT", "THz frequencies", "conditional stability", "distributed circuit model", "electron drift velocity", "electron plasma wave excitation", "gain medium", "gate NDC", "high electron mobility transistor channel", "negative differential conductance", "numerical analysis", "plasma wave group velocity", "power amplification", "resonant tunnel diode gate structure", "terahertz frequencies", "Gain", "HEMTs", "Impedance", "Logic gates", "MODFETs", "Plasma waves", "Power transmission lines", "Amplification", "gain", "high electron mobility transistor (HEMT)", "negative differential conductance (NDC)", "plasma", "resonant tunnel diode (RTD)", "terahertz (THz)", ""], "arnumber": "6418077"}
