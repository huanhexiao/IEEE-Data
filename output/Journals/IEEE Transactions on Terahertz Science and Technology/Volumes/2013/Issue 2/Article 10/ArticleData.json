Terahertz radiation is generated by difference-frequency mixing of two electrically pumped high-order near-infrared laser WGM's at room temperature in the active cavity. Due to the leaky nature of the low-order THz WGM, the generated radiation can be efficiently emitted into free space. The inherent high symmetry of the THz WGM prohibits efficient THz emission in the normal direction from the device. We investigate techniques based on concentric surface plasmon polariton gratings to break this symmetry by modification of the dielectric environment of the resonator, and demonstrate a fabrication-optimized structure based on a concentric grating design which efficiently couples the emitted radiation into a narrow, near-gaussian forward-propagating cone of well-defined linear or circular polarization.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "192", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "199", "date_publication": "Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13355413", "date": "March 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "2", "pages": "192 - 199", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Krzysztof Iwaszczuk", "Christer Zoffmann Bisgaard", "Alessio Andronico", "Giuseppe Leo", "Peter Uhd Jepsen"], "keywords": ["dielectric polarisation", "dielectric resonators", "micromechanical resonators", "polaritons", "submillimetre wave measurement", "surface plasmons", "whispering gallery modes", "WGM terahertz resonators", "circular polarization", "concentric grating design", "concentric surface plasmon polariton gratings", "dielectric environment modification", "difference-frequency mixing", "electromagnetic design", "linear polarization", "microring difference-frequency resonators", "near-gaussian forward-propagating cone", "near-infrared laser WGM", "temperature 293 K to 298 K", "terahertz emission properties", "terahertz radiation", "whispering gallery mode", "Cavity resonators", "Couplings", "Gratings", "Materials", "Optical resonators", "Q factor", "Resonant frequency", "Antenna radiation patterns", "optical beams", "submillimeter-wave devices", "terahertz optics", ""], "arnumber": "6464566"}
