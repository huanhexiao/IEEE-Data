Frequency-division multiplexing is used to acquire multiple pixels simultaneously. The modulator was used to acquire THz transmission images with \u03bb/4 resolution at 118 \u03bcm. The image acquisition speed is 16 times greater than that of a comparable single-aperture subwavelength imaging technique. Additionally, spectroscopic THz imaging with subwavelength spatial resolution can be accomplished with the modulator, and the technique is scalable to at least 100 simultaneous pixels.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "165", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "171", "date_publication": "Wed Jan 23 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13355408", "date": "March 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "2", "pages": "165 - 171", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["J\u0119drzej Szelc", "Harvey Rutt"], "keywords": ["frequency division multiplexing", "image resolution", "modulators", "terahertz spectroscopy", "terahertz wave imaging", "frequency-division multiplexing", "image acquisition", "multiple subwavelength aperture modulator", "near-field THz spectroscopy", "near-field simultaneous multiple pixel subwavelength THz transmission imaging device", "solid-state THz spatial modulator", "subwavelength spatial resolution", "wavelength 118 mum", "Absorption", "Apertures", "Detectors", "Frequency division multiplexing", "Frequency modulation", "Imaging", "Far-infrared (FIR)", "imaging", "microscopy", "multiple pixel", "near-field", "spatial modulator", "spectroscopy", "subwavelength", "terahertz (THz)", ""], "arnumber": "6418078"}
