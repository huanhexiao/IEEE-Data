It was found that the red-shift of the [\u00b11, 0] spoof surface-plasmon (SSP) transmission peak from the Wood's anomaly valley indicates the coupling strength of the SSP wave to the metal surface due to the filling factor and shape of the holes, and that the red-shift provides a measurement of the SSP wave velocity. Our measurements of the amplitude transmission peak, and the corresponding reflection dip, of the hole-array agreed with numerical simulation to an accuracy of \u00b12 GHz, and the measured phase was in good agreement with simulation. However, our reflection measurements showed a second unexplained dip at the frequency of Wood's anomaly.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "151", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "157", "date_publication": "Mon Feb 18 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13355412", "date": "March 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "2", "pages": "151 - 157", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Yuping Yang", "Daniel R.
