We report the most recent progresses in THz generation and detection in laser-induced gas plasma. The overall emphasis of this paper is on THz wave detection with gaseous medium, while in the generation part, emphasis will be on the case with two-color laser excitation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "274", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "281", "date_publication": "Sept. 2011", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12216098", "date": "Sept. 2011", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "1", "pages": "274 - 281", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Jianming Dai", "Benjamin Clough", "I-Chen Ho", "Xiaofei Lu", "Jingle Liu", "Xi-Cheng Zhang"], "keywords": ["plasma devices", "plasma production by laser", "terahertz wave detectors", "terahertz wave generation", "gaseous medium", "laser-induced gas plasma", "terahertz wave air photonics", "terahertz wave detection", "terahertz wave emitter", "terahertz wave generation", "terahertz wave sensor", "two-color laser excitation", "Free electron lasers", "Gas lasers", "Mirrors", "Optical beams", "Optical pulses", "Optical sensors", "Plasmas", "Broadband terahertz waves", "THz radiation-enhanced emission of fluorescence (THz-REEF)", "THz-enhanced acoustics (TEA)", "coherent control", "laser-induced gas plasma", "remote terahertz wave sensing", ""], "arnumber": "6005350"}
