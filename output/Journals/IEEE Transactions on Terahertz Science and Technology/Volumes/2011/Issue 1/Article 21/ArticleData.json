The measured transmitted pulses reshaped from a 0.5-ps input pulse into an output pulse structure with a 5-ps symmetric pulse at the leading edge followed by a frequency-swept, rapidly oscillating trailing edge extending with increasing frequency to beyond 150 ps. The leading pulse appearing in the output pulse structure is composed of phase-locked frequency components extending from 0.07 to 0.37 THz that experienced negligible attenuation and group velocity dispersion due to transmission through water vapor. Such a stable pulse shape is suitable for the THz bit in a digital THz communications channel. Our results demonstrate a bit rate-distance product of greater than 8 (Gb/s)-km, which is comparable to an optical fiber digital communications channel.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "264", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "273", "date_publication": "Sept. 2011", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12216080", "date": "Sept. 2011", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "1", "pages": "264 - 273", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Yihong Yang", "Mahboubeh Mandehgar", "Daniel R.
