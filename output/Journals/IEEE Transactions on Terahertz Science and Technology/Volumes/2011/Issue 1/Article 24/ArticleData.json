Recent advances in THz components, such as ultrashort pulsed lasers and photoconductive antennas, have improved the sensitivity of THz time-domain (TDS) spectroscopy and have made the THz chemical imaging possible. THz chemical imaging can reveal hydrogen bond distributions and will be a very powerful tool in biology, pharmacology, and life sciences. THz-TDS is also promising for the quantitative chemical analysis and detection of molecules and clusters in nanospace and ice.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "293", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "300", "date_publication": "Sept. 2011", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12216075", "date": "Sept. 2011", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "1", "pages": "293 - 300", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Katsuhiro Ajito", "Yuko Ueno"], "keywords": ["antennas", "biological techniques", "high-speed optical techniques", "molecular biophysics", "photoconducting devices", "spectrochemical analysis", "terahertz spectroscopy", "THz chemical imaging", "THz components", "THz spectroscopy", "THz time domain spectroscopy", "analytical chemistry", "biological applications", "hydrations", "hydrogen bond distributions", "hydrogen bonds", "intermolecular interactions", "molecular networks", "photoconductive antennas", "ultrashort pulsed lasers", "Absorption", "Amino acids", "Chemicals", "Crystals", "Imaging", "Spectroscopy", "Cancer diagnosis", "hydrogen bonds", "molecular clusters", "molecular interactions", "molecular networks", "quantitative chemical analysis", "terahertz chemical imaging", ""], "arnumber": "6005325"}
