We used a self-consistent line dipole image method for the quantitative analysis of the THz near-field interaction. The line scan across a gold film demonstrated that the terahertz microscope has a nanoscale resolution of ~80 nm. The measurements of scattering signals on gold and silicon substrates were in good agreement with calculations.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "164", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "168", "date_publication": "Sept. 2011", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12216082", "date": "Sept. 2011", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "1", "pages": "164 - 168", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Kiwon Moon", "Euna Jung", "Meehyun Lim", "Youngwoong Do", "Haewook Han"], "keywords": ["electromagnetic wave scattering", "gold", "near-field scanning optical microscopy", "silicon", "terahertz wave imaging", "Au", "Si", "quantitative analysis", "scattering signals", "self consistent line dipole image method", "terahertz near field microscope", "terahertz pulse scattering", "Gold", "Microscopy", "Optical imaging", "Optical scattering", "Probes", "Substrates", "Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy", "terahertz scanning near-field microscope", "terahertz wave", ""], "arnumber": "6005332"}
