We start out by introducing a novel waveguide-based all-electronic imaging system which operates at 812 GHz. Its salient feature is a 32-pixel linear detector array heterodyne-operated at the eighth subharmonic. This array in combination with a telescope optics for object distances of 2-6 m reaches a data acquisition speed suited for real-time imaging. The second system described then is again an all-electronic scanner (now for around 300 GHz ), designed for object distances of \u2265 8 m , which combines mechanical scanning in vertical direction, synthetic-aperture image generation in horizontal direction, and frequency-modulated continuous-wave sweeping for the depth information. The third and fourth systems follow an optoelectronic approach by relying on several- to multi-pixel parallel electrooptic detection. One imager is based on a pulsed THz-OPO and homodyne detection with a CCD camera, the other on either continuous-wave electronic or femtosecond optoelectronic THz sources and a photonic-mixing device (PMD) camera. The article concludes with a description of the state of the art of imaging with focal-plane arrays based on CMOS field-effect transistors.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "183", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "200", "date_publication": "Sept. 2011", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12216091", "date": "Sept. 2011", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "1", "pages": "183 - 200", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Fabian Friederich", "Wolff von Spiegel", "Maris Bauer", "Fanzhen Meng", "Mark D.
