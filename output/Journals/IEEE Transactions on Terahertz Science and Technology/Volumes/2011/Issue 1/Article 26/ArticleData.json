The joint experiments yield the complex dielectric function over more than four orders of magnitude in frequency. The dielectric absorption data smoothly join with data from Fourier transform far-infrared (FT-FIR) spectroscopy. All dielectric spectra were fitted to a multimodal relaxation model. The observed processes are assigned to low-frequency re-orientational relaxation of the dipolar ions and to intermolecular vibrations between the cations and anions. The dielectric spectra show a dependence on the length and OH-functionalization of the alkyl residues of the cation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "313", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "320", "date_publication": "Sept. 2011", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12216083", "date": "Sept. 2011", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "1", "pages": "313 - 320", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Matthias Kruger", "Mian-Mian Huang", "Erik Brundermann", "Hermann Weingartner", "Martina Havenith"], "keywords": ["Fourier transform spectroscopy", "dielectric liquids", "microwave spectra", "microwave spectroscopy", "organic compounds", "terahertz spectroscopy", "terahertz wave spectra", "Fourier transform far infrared spectroscopy", "complex dielectric function", "homologous protic ionic liquids", "inter molecular dynamics", "intermolecular interactions", "magnitude in frequency", "microwave dielectric spectroscopy", "multimodal relaxation model", "terahertz spectroscopy", "Dielectric measurements", "Dielectrics", "Frequency measurement", "Liquids", "Microwave oscillators", "Spectroscopy", "Time domain analysis", "Dielectric relaxation", "THz time-domain spectroscopy", "ionic liquids", "microwave dielectric spectroscopy", ""], "arnumber": "6005333"}
