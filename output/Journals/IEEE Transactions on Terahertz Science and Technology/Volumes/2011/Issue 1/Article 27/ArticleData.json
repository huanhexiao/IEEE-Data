We have analyzed typically employed THz spectroscopy systems and their sensitivity in a general comparative approach. Recent progress to reduce the data acquisition time by frequency multiplexing using a spectrometer with a THz quantum cascade laser is described. The performance of a spectrometer using a pulsed Ge THz laser with a few \u03bcs long integration time and recent progress to modulate the laser current within such a short pulse are presented. We also investigate the origin of random errors in intensity spectra of a THz TDS with the goal to identify common error sources in TDS systems to allow reduction of the total measurement time.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "321", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "331", "date_publication": "Sept. 2011", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12216076", "date": "Sept. 2011", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "1", "pages": "321 - 331", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Heinz-Wilhelm Hubers", "Maurice F.
