We review the utility of these lines, give examples of the science they deliver, and detail the properties of successful low resolution direct detection spectrometers for work in the THz regime. We finish with a discussion of the exciting new science we expect with the next direct detection generation spectrometers on new facilities such as SOFIA, CCAT, SPICA, and ALMA.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "241", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "255", "date_publication": "Sept. 2011", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12216094", "date": "Sept. 2011", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 29 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "1", "pages": "241 - 255", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Gordon J.
