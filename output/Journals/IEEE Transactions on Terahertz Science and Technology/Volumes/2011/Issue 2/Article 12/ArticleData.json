The HSRT method is capable of modeling arbitrary three-dimensional dielectric and metallic structures. We compare and validate various versions of the HSRT method including MoM-SRT, and MLFMM-SRT, with measurements and commercial software FEKO for method of moments (MoM), multi-level fast multipole method (MLFMM) and physical optics (PO) via simulation of a bow-tie terahertz antenna backed by hyper-hemispherical silicon lens and an on-chip dipole antenna attached to lens. It is shown that the MoM-SRT is more accurate than MoM-PO and comparable in speed. The HSRT algorithm is applied to simulation of on-chip dipole antenna backed by Silicon lens and integrated with a 180-GHz VCO and compared with measurements. In addition, it is shown that the matrix formulation of SRT and HSRT is a promising approach for solving complex electrically large problems with high accuracy.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "425", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "434", "date_publication": "Thu Sep 15 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12318425", "date": "Nov. 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 27 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "2", "pages": "425 - 434", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Daniel M.
