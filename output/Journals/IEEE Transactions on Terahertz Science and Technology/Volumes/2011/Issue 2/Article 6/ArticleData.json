We first present an approximate analytical model from which we derive a proposed rule of thumb for deciding when the film is thin enough to support a current distribution that is uniform in the transverse direction. We then verify this rule by performing electromagnetic simulations. Our conclusion is that the current distribution in thin films with a relatively high DC resistivity and small film thickness with respect to the skin depth is essentially uniform up to 8 THz. These results are crucial, e.g., for understanding radiation coupling between an HEB and an antenna and indispensable when analyzing detectors and receivers based on bolometric properties of thin films.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "383", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "389", "date_publication": "Mon Sep 12 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12318424", "date": "Nov. 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 27 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "2", "pages": "383 - 389", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Erik L.
