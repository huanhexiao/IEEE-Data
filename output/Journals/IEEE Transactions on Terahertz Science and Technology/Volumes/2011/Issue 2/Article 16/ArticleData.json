To support this demand by innovative and resourceful use of technology, future communication systems will have to shift towards higher carrier frequencies. Due to the tight regulatory situation, frequencies in the atmospheric attenuation window around 300 GHz appear very attractive to facilitate an indoor, short range, ultra high speed THz communication system. In this paper, we investigate the influence of diffuse scattering at such high frequencies on the characteristics of the communication channel and its implications on the non-line-of-sight propagation path. The Kirchhoff approach is verified by an experimental study of diffuse scattering from randomly rough surfaces commonly encountered in indoor environments using a fiber-coupled terahertz time-domain spectroscopy system to perform angle- and frequency-dependent measurements. Furthermore, we integrate the Kirchhoff approach into a self-developed ray tracing algorithm to model the signal coverage of a typical office scenario.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "462", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "472", "date_publication": "Mon Jun 13 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12318420", "date": "Nov. 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 27 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "2", "pages": "462 - 472", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Christian Jansen", "Sebastian Priebe", "Christoph Moller", "Martin Jacob", "Hanno Dierke", "Martin Koch", "Thomas Kurner"], "keywords": ["indoor communication", "ray tracing", "surface phonons", "surface roughness", "telecommunication links", "terahertz spectroscopy", "terahertz wave devices", "Kirchhoff approach", "THz communication channels", "diffuse scattering", "fiber coupled terahertz time domain spectroscopy system", "indoor environments", "nonline of sight propagation path", "rough surfaces", "self developed ray tracing algorithm", "Channel models", "Communication channels", "Correlation", "Ray tracing", "Rough surfaces", "Scattering", "Channel modeling", "diffuse scattering", "propagation modeling", "ray tracing", "scattering measurements", "sub millimeter wave communications", ""], "arnumber": "5873179"}
