Power is generated at microwave frequencies and then frequency multiplied to the band 799-938 GHz. The resultant signal is radiated by a diagonal horn and redirected by two identical elliptical mirrors to another diagonal horn located far away. Useful design equations have been derived for the proposed system. The concept has been proven by careful measurements and utilized for the local oscillator injection in the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) Band-10 receiver.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "416", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "424", "date_publication": "Tue Apr 05 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12318416", "date": "Nov. 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 27 00:00:00 EDT 2011", "issue": "2", "pages": "416 - 424", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Alvaro Gonzalez", "Yoshinori Uzawa", "Yasunori Fujii", "Keiko Kaneko", "Koichi Kuroiwa"], "keywords": ["mirrors", "radiotelescopes", "submillimetre astronomy", "submillimetre wave receivers", "ALMA", "Atacama large millimeter array band-10 receiver", "design equations", "diagonal horn", "elliptical mirror", "frequency 799 GHz to 938 GHz", "horn-to-horn power transmission system", "local oscillator injection", "microwave frequencies", "terahertz frequencies", "Apertures", "Mirrors", "Mixers", "Power transmission", "Receivers", "Submillimeter wave measurements", "Atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array", "Gaussian beams", "Submillimeter wave technology", "quasi-optical waveguides", "submillimeter wave measurements", ""], "arnumber": "5741779"}
