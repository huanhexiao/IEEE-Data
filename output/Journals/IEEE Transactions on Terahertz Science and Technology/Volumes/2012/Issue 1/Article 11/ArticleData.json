With imaging and chemical identification capabilities, terahertz (THz) spectroscopy can be a good modality for visualizing and quantifying transdermal drug delivery. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of THz reflection tomographic imaging for visualizing the distribution and penetration of a topical agent, ketoprofen dissolved in DMSO, using ex vivo and in vivo mouse skins. THz reflection imaging of ex vivo and in vivo skins demonstrated greater contrast between the drug-applied sites and unapplied skin than that of visual images. The reflectance signal of drug-applied sites was determined by mixed THz response of skin tissue, diffused ketoprofen, and DMSO content. Interestingly, serial B-scan images revealed that a new dark layer appeared at the drug-applied sites 1 h after drug application, which might be related with permeated ketoprofen. This study demonstrates that THz imaging technique can be utilized for imaging the distribution of topically applied drugs.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "99", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "106", "date_publication": "Mon Dec 19 00:00:00 EST 2011", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12471910", "date": "Jan. 2012", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 16 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "99 - 106", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Kyung Won Kim", "Hyeongmun Kim", "Jisuk Park", "Joon Koo Han", "Joo-Hiuk Son"], "keywords": ["drug delivery systems", "drugs", "skin", "terahertz wave imaging", "DMSO", "THz reflection tomographic imaging", "THz spectroscopy", "chemical identification capabilities", "dark layer", "diffused ketoprofen", "in vivo imaging methods", "mouse skins", "permeated ketoprofen", "reflectance signal", "serial B-scan images", "skin tissue", "terahertz tomographic imaging", "time 1 hr", "topical agent", "topical drugs", "transdermal drug delivery", "visualization", "Absorption", "Drugs", "Imaging", "In vivo", "Mice", "Skin", "Time domain analysis", "Medical imaging and spectroscopy", "skin imaging", "terahertz (THz) imaging", "transdermal drug delivery", ""], "arnumber": "6108368"}
