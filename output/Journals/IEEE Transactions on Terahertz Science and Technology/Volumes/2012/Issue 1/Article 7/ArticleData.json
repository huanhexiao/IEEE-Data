A key feature of these horns is that they can be manufactured very rapidly and cheaply in large numbers, by repeated direct drilling into a single plate of aluminum using a shaped machine tool. The rapid manufacturing technique will enable the construction of very low cost focal-plane arrays, offering an alternative to conventional electroformed corrugated horn arrays. In order to experimentally demonstrate the new technology, we constructed a 230 GHz focal-plane array comprising 37 smooth- walled horns fabricated by direct drilling. We present the measured beam patterns for a large sample of these horns across the array, demonstrating the suitability of our manufacturing techniques for large format arrays. We have measured the cross coupling between adjacent feeds and have shown that it is negligible. We also present high quality beam patterns measured for a much smaller 700 GHz horn, showing the promise of the extending this technology to THz frequencies.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "61", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "70", "date_publication": "Thu Dec 08 00:00:00 EST 2011", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12471905", "date": "Jan. 2012", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 16 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "61 - 70", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Jamie Leech", "Boon Kok Tan", "Ghassan Yassin", "Phichet Kittara", "Sujint Wangsuya"], "keywords": ["antenna arrays", "genetic algorithms", "horn antennas", "aluminum plate", "conventional electroformed corrugated horn arrays", "direct drilling", "focal-plane arrays", "frequency 230 GHz", "frequency 700 GHz", "genetic algorithm", "high performance focal-plane horn array", "high quality beam patterns", "manufacturing techniques", "rapid manufacturing technique", "shaped machine tool", "smooth-walled multiple flare-angle horns", "Aluminum", "Arrays", "Bandwidth", "Genetic algorithms", "Pattern matching", "Prototypes", "Structural beams", "Antenna radiation patterns", "genetic algorithms", "horn antennas", "radio astronomy", ""], "arnumber": "6097084"}
