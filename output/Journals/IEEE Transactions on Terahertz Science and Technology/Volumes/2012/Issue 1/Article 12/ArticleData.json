However, the performance of algorithms analyzing this data has been weak, especially with a low signal-to-noise ratio. We have developed a new approach for analyzing this data that is robust against the effects of scattering and variable power spectral density. Identification of chemicals with over 97% accuracy is achieved with a false positive rate of only 0.3% on a dataset giving the literature methods much difficulty.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "107", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "112", "date_publication": "Wed Dec 21 00:00:00 EST 2011", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12471916", "date": "Jan. 2012", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 16 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "107 - 112", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["David Brigada", "Xi-Cheng Zhang"], "keywords": ["chemical sensors", "dielectric materials", "information theory", "optical materials", "terahertz spectroscopy", "time-domain analysis", "chemical identification", "data analysis", "information theory", "optical opaque dielectric materials", "power spectral density", "time-domain terahertz spectrometry", "Libraries", "Principal component analysis", "Scattering", "Signal to noise ratio", "Spectroscopy", "Vectors", "Information theory", "spectroscopy", "submillimeter-wave measurements", "time-domain analysis", "ultrafast optics", ""], "arnumber": "6111334"}
