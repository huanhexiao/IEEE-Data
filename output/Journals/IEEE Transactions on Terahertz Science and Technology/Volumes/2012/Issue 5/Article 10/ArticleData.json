These phenomena have been evidenced in recent experiments, in which THz detection as a result of plasma wave resonances has been demonstrated. In this paper, by means of Monte Carlo simulations, the noise spectra and the AC-DC rectification properties of the devices have been calculated and linked to the properties of the plasma oscillations within two distinct parts of the source-gate region: the capped and the recessed sections of the channel.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "562", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "569", "date_publication": "Thu Aug 23 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12961093", "date": "Sept. 2012", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 30 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "562 - 569", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Javier Mateos", "Toms Gonzalez"], "keywords": ["III-V semiconductors", "Monte Carlo methods", "gallium arsenide", "high electron mobility transistors", "indium compounds", "plasma oscillations", "plasma waves", "AC signal rectification", "AC-DC rectification properties", "HEMT", "InGaAs", "Monte Carlo simulation", "THz detection", "THz signals", "high frequency collective phenomena", "noise spectra", "plasma enhanced terahertz rectification", "plasma oscillations", "plasma wave resonances", "source-gate region", "Electric potential", "HEMTs", "Logic gates", "MODFETs", "Noise", "Plasmas", "Resonant frequency", "InGaAs high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs)", "Monte Carlo simulation", "THz detection", "plasma oscillations", ""], "arnumber": "6280645"}
