Two-dimensional reconstructions of sub-wavelength dielectric cylinders in air are performed through iterative coordinate descent (ICD) optimization in a Bayesian framework using experimental data obtained by illuminating the objects with a THz beam. Strategies for avoiding local minima and to allow for faster convergence and improved image quality are presented and evaluated.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "493", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "503", "date_publication": "Wed Aug 29 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12961101", "date": "Sept. 2012", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 30 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "493 - 503", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Hsiao-Rho Tsai", "Florian Enderli", "Thomas Feurer", "Kevin J.
