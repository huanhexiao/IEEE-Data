The system software based on the oscilloscope is designed to control the object movement, and the capture and display of the continuous THz wave image data. The imaging of different objects is tested at the frequencies of 450 GHz and 890 GHz to show the validity of the imaging system at room temperature. The influence of object's humidity and thickness, incident wavelength, and translation step on the THz imaging is discussed in details. The direct gray level transformation method and the histogram equalization method are adopted to process the original data to obtain high-quality THz images.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "504", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "512", "date_publication": "Fri Aug 24 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12961095", "date": "Sept. 2012", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 30 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "504 - 512", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Gang Chen", "Jie Pei", "Fei Yang", "Xiao Yang Zhou", "Z.
