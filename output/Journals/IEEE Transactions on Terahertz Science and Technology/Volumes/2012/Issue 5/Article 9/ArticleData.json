The diffraction properties of the grating are derived by simulation of electro-magnetic field scattering and are compared with angle-dependent measurements obtained in a terahertz time-domain setup. An excellent match between simulation and measurement is found, demonstrating the ability of the terahertz transmission blaze-grating for spatial dispersion of terahertz waves. Thus, this and similar terahertz transmission blaze-gratings can be used as dispersive elements for applications such as spectrometers or novel THz imaging systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "556", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "561", "date_publication": "Fri Aug 24 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12961097", "date": "Sept. 2012", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 30 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "556 - 561", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Benedikt Scherger", "Norman Born", "Christian Jansen", "Steffen Schumann", "Martin Koch", "Karin Wiesauer"], "keywords": ["compression moulding", "diffraction gratings", "terahertz wave spectra", "angle-dependent measurements", "compression molded terahertz transmission blaze-grating", "dispersive elements", "electromagnetic field scattering simulation", "grating diffraction properties", "micropowder compression molding", "spatial dispersion", "spectrometers", "terahertz imaging systems", "terahertz time-domain setup", "terahertz waves", "Diffraction", "Diffraction gratings", "Fabrication", "Gratings", "Imaging", "Lenses", "Optimized production technology", "Diffraction gratings", "optical fabrication", "terahertz (THz) spectroscopy", ""], "arnumber": "6287044"}
