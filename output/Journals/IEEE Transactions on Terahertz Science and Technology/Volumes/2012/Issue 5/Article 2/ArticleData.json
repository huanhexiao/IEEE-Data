In order to reduce complexity and cost of conventional THz tomography systems, we propose a new approach using broadband THz noise sources based on amplified spontaneous emission noise, which is analogous to the optical coherence tomography (OCT) using broadband infrared sources. We have experimentally demonstrated a 3D imaging system with depth and spatial resolutions of 1 and 2 mm, respectively, by 280-380 GHz band noise signals.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "485", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "492", "date_publication": "Mon Aug 27 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12961099", "date": "Sept. 2012", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 30 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "485 - 492", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Takayuki Isogawa", "Takuto Kumashiro", "Ho-Jin Song", "Katsuhiro Ajito", "Naoya Kukutsu", "Katsumi Iwatsuki", "Tadao Nagatsuma"], "keywords": ["nondestructive testing", "optical tomography", "terahertz wave imaging", "amplified spontaneous emission noise", "broadband THz noise source", "broadband infrared source", "frequency 280 GHz to 380 GHz", "optical coherence tomography", "photonically generated low-coherence terahertz noise source", "three-dimensional terahertz imaging", "tomographic imaging", "Coherence", "Interference", "Noise", "Optical imaging", "Power generation", "Tomography", "Imaging", "low-coherence", "noise sources", "terahertz", "tomography", ""], "arnumber": "6287627"}
