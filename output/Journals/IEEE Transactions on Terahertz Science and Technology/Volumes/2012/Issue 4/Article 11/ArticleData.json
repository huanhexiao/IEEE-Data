The dependence of phase change on the dielectric loading of the DC-SSPP structure causes the output from both arms to interfere and enhances features on the transmission spectrum of the MZI. The paper uses a mathematical model to predict the phase accumulation of THz signals travelling through each arm of the MZI with various sample loadings. HFSS simulation has been performed to verify the theoretical modeling and produce more sophisticated results. The paper demonstrates that compared with single-armed SSPP waveguide, the proposed MZI structure shows significant shift of the transmission maxima and minima with high quality factors for the transmission peaks when different materials are loaded. The paper also demonstrates that the proposed DC-SSPP MZI structure can be potentially used in tag-free bio-molecular sensing. The highly localized E-M field at frequencies close to SSPP resonance is shown to reduce the sample amount needed to produce interference patterns without affecting the selectivity of the sensing structure.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "460", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "466", "date_publication": "Tue Jun 26 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12850815", "date": "July 2012", "date_current_version": "Wed Jul 11 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "460 - 466", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Zhao Xu", "Pinaki Mazumder"], "keywords": ["Mach-Zehnder interferometers", "biosensors", "chemical sensors", "molecular biophysics", "polaritons", "surface plasmons", "terahertz spectroscopy", "waveguides", "DC-SSPP dielectric loading", "DC-SSPP waveguide", "HFSS simulation", "MZI structure", "MZI transmission spectrum", "Mach-Zehnder interferometer", "THz signal phase accumulation", "biosensing", "doubly corrugated spoofed SPP waveguide", "mathematical model", "phase change", "surface plasmon polariton", "tag free biomolecular sensing", "transmission maxima shift", "transmission minima shift", "DNA", "Dielectric materials", "Dielectrics", "Loading", "Mathematical model", "Periodic structures", "Refractive index", "Bio-molecular sensing", "Mach&#x2013", "Zehnder interferometer (MZI)", "doubly-corrugated spoofed surface plasmon polariton (DC-SSPP)", "phase difference", ""], "arnumber": "6226433"}
