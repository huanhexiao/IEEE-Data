Experiments with state-of-the-art photomixers, operated at room temperature and in cryogenic environment demonstrate successful operation of an astronomical heterodyne receiver at 1050 GHz with a superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) mixer. The system noise temperature of the heterodyne receiver pumped by the photonic LO was at least as low as that using a conventional solid-state LO in the same receiver system. An optical comb generator served as a relative frequency reference to which both lasers were phase-locked. Under the phase lock condition, the 3 dB linewidth of the THz signal was below 3 kHz and could be continuously tuned within a range of 500 MHz-the overall tunability of the system was determined by the photomixer antenna resonance bandwidth, which was roughly 200 GHz. We installed the laser system in the telescope pedestal, from there, the frequency-stabilized laser signal, was fed into the photomixer, installed in the Nasmyth cabin of the telescope, through a 20 meters long single-mode fiber optic.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "393", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "399", "date_publication": "Thu Apr 19 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12850810", "date": "July 2012", "date_current_version": "Wed Jul 11 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "393 - 399", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Iv\u00e1n C\u00e1mara Mayorga", "Andreas Schmitz", "Thomas Klein", "Christian Leinz", "Rolf Gusten"], "keywords": ["cryogenics", "optical fibres", "phase locked oscillators", "radio receivers", "radiotelescopes", "superconductor-insulator-superconductor mixers", "terahertz materials", "Atacama Pathfinder experiment", "Nasmyth cabin", "astronomical heterodyne receiver", "conventional solid-state LO", "cryogenic environment", "frequency 1.05 THz", "frequency-stabilized laser signal", "long single-mode fiber optic", "optical comb generator", "phase lock condition", "photomixer antenna resonance bandwidth", "photomixing technology", "photonic local oscillator", "radiotelescope", "size 20 m", "state-of-the-art photomixers", "superconductor-insulator-superconductor mixer", "system noise temperature", "telescope pedestal", "terahertz astronomy", "Extraterrestrial measurements", "Noise", "Optical pumping", "Photonics", "Receivers", "Solids", "Temperature measurement", "Photonic local oscillators", "Terahertz photomixing", "terahertz sources", ""], "arnumber": "6187680"}
