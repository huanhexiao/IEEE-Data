Although the algorithm is suited for multiple purposes, it is applied in this paper to a millimeter-wave radar system that operates in a frequency-modulated continuous-wave mode between 234 and 306 GHz. After initially mapping the bistatic to a quasi-monostatic configuration, the algorithm recursively factorizes both, the aperture positions and the target area. Three-dimensional reconstructions are shown for a simulated point-target in order to evaluate the point-spread-function of the system. In addition, 2-D-imaging is performed on real objects at stand-off distances using a scanner system that consists of 8 transmitters and 16 receivers. Reconstructions with the BiFFBP-algorithm are compared with the global back-projection (GBP) algorithm that serves as a benchmark. The results show that the BiFFBP-approach yields similar results to the GBP with respect to dynamic range in the image and the overall image quality. It is also shown that a resolution of 2 cm can be achieved with relatively few elements, no scanning, and over a large field-of-view.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "432", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "440", "date_publication": "Wed Jun 20 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12850813", "date": "July 2012", "date_current_version": "Wed Jul 11 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "432 - 440", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Jochen Moll", "Philipp Schops", "Viktor Krozer"], "keywords": ["image reconstruction", "millimetre wave radar", "radar imaging", "radar receivers", "radar transmitters", "3-D synthetic image reconstruction", "BiFFBP algorithm", "GBP", "Three-dimensional reconstructions", "bistatic fast-factorized back-projection algorithm", "frequency 234 GHz to 306 GHz", "frequency-modulated continuous-wave mode", "global back-projection algorithm", "millimeter-wave radar system", "point-spread-function", "quasi-monostatic configuration", "receivers", "scanner system", "three-dimensional millimeter-wave radar", "time-domain approach", "transmitters", "Apertures", "Focusing", "Image reconstruction", "Millimeter wave radar", "Radar imaging", "Receivers", "Bistatic radar", "millimeter-wave radar", "radar imaging", "signal processing", ""], "arnumber": "6222006"}
