The sensitive element is made of the ultrathin superconducting NbN film patterned as a bridge at the feed of the antenna. The contacts between the antenna and a sensitive element are made from in situ deposited gold (i.e., deposited over NbN film without breaking vacuum), which gives high quality contacts and makes the response of the HEB at higher frequencies less affected by the RF loss. An accurate experimental spectroscopic procedure is demonstrated that leads to the confirmation of the wide ( 8 THz) bandwidth in this antenna coupled device.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "400", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "405", "date_publication": "Tue Jun 26 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12850814", "date": "July 2012", "date_current_version": "Wed Jul 11 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "400 - 405", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Alexander Shurakov", "Sergey Seliverstov", "Natalia Kaurova", "Matvey Finkel", "Boris Voronov", "Gregory Goltsman"], "keywords": ["bolometers", "gold", "planar antennas", "spiral antennas", "superconducting thin films", "ultra wideband antennas", "Au-NbN", "HEB", "NbN", "RF loss", "antenna coupled device", "hot electron bolometer", "planar log spiral antenna", "spectroscopic procedure", "ultrathin superconducting NbN film", "Antenna measurements", "Antennas", "Bandwidth", "Bolometers", "Frequency measurement", "Spirals", "Temperature measurement", "Hot electron bolometer (HEB)", "terahertz (THz) region", "ultra wideband antennas", ""], "arnumber": "6226432"}
