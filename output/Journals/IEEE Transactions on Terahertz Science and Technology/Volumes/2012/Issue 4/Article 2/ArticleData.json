Herschel was launched on 14 May 2009, and following cooldown and commissioning, HIFI has been used along with the other two focal plane instruments for a wide variety of astronomical observations. These have ranged from studies of the structure of the interstellar medium in nearby galaxies to detailed studies of the chemistry in star-forming regions of the Milky Way. Observations of the solar system have yielded new results about water in comets and its relationship to the Earth's oceans. In this paper, following a brief review of the instrument and its performance, we give an overview of the most important HIFI discoveries to date. This is necessarily very selective, but is intended to give a hint of the results obtained with this instrument that has really opened submillimeter wavelengths for high-sensitivity/high-resolution spectroscopy.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "383", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "392", "date_publication": "Wed Jun 27 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12850816", "date": "July 2012", "date_current_version": "Wed Jul 11 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "383 - 392", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Paul F.
