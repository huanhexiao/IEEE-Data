Scaled setups are often used in order to facilitate RCS measurements in a well-defined laboratory environment. As radar frequencies steadily increase, for high scaling factors these measurements have to be carried out in the THz regime. In this paper, we propose an experimental setup consisting of a fiber-coupled THz time-domain spectrometer integrated with a two circle goniometer, which enables bistatic scaled RCS measurements. To assess the accuracy of the setup, measurements on reference objects as well as on scale model aircraft are performed. The measured data of the reference objects is compared to the theoretical predictions. As for the aircraft, the comparison between a Panavia 200 Tornado and a Lockheed F117 Nighthawk is made and the influence of individual components like bombs on the overall RCS is evaluated.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "424", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "431", "date_publication": "Thu May 10 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12850811", "date": "July 2012", "date_current_version": "Wed Jul 11 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "424 - 431", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Ralf Gente", "Christian Jansen", "Robert Geise", "Ole Peters", "Michael Gente", "Norman Krumbholz", "Christoph Moller", "Stefan Busch", "Martin Koch"], "keywords": ["aircraft", "aircraft instrumentation", "goniometers", "radar cross-sections", "terahertz spectroscopy", "Lockheed F117 Nighthawk", "Panavia 200 Tornado", "circle goniometer", "fiber-coupled THz time-domain spectrometer", "scale model aircraft", "scaled bistatic radar cross section measurements", "Aircraft", "Antenna measurements", "Atmospheric modeling", "Frequency measurement", "Radar cross section", "Receivers", "Scattering", "Bistatic radar", "radar cross section", "scattering measurements", "submillimeter wave measurements", ""], "arnumber": "6198321"}
