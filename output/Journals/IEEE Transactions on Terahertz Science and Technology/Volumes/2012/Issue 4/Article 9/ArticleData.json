At THz frequencies, the thicknesses of commercially available substrates are comparable to the free-space wavelength. As a result, the substrate plays a critical role in determining the transmission characteristics of THz multilayer FSS structures. Proper coupling method between FSS structures should be chosen to avoid unwanted substrate resonances or Fabry-Pe\u0301rot resonances, which otherwise degrade the transmission characteristics of the cascaded FSS structure. In this paper, a cascaded structure to avoid multiple reflections within the substrate is presented and the same is used to realize two double-layered FSS structures to improve the transmission response. The transmission response is improved by introducing an extra transmission zero at a frequency location lower than the resonant frequency, thereby achieving high roll-off rate for the lower side of the stop band, and to suppress unwanted resonances, thereby increasing the rejection bandwidth of the filter. The proposed cascaded FSS structures were fabricated and tested using THz time-domain spectroscopy. Good agreement between simulations and experiments were obtained.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "441", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "448", "date_publication": "Tue Jul 10 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12850819", "date": "July 2012", "date_current_version": "Wed Jul 11 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "441 - 448", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Subash Vegesna", "Yanhan Zhu", "Ayrton Bernussi", "Mohammad Saed"], "keywords": ["Fabry-Perot resonators", "frequency selective surfaces", "resonators", "submillimetre wave filters", "terahertz spectroscopy", "Fabry-Pe&#x0301", "rot resonance", "THz multilayer FSS structure", "THz time-domain spectroscopy", "cascaded FSS structure", "cascaded configuration", "coupling method", "double-layered FSS structure", "electrically thick substrate", "filtering characteristics", "terahertz two-layer frequency selective surface", "transmission characteristics", "transmission response", "unwanted substrate resonance", "Filtering theory", "Frequency response", "Frequency selective surfaces", "Passband", "Periodic structures", "Resonant frequency", "Substrates", "Frequency selective surfaces (FSS)", "THz filters", "THz time-domain spectroscopy (TDS)", "multilayer terahertz (THz) FSS", ""], "arnumber": "6236290"}
