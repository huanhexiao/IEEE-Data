The imaging algorithm provides focusing by compensating for the antenna footprint. This allows for using a more simple antenna system without optical focusing. Several aspects of implementing an imaging algorithm based on the Born approximation in THz imaging are discussed and key system properties are highlighted. The performance of the imaging algorithm is verified by imaging two simple dielectric targets. The results indicate that this approach provides a qualitative indication of the distribution of contrast in the samples complex permittivity and is a potential complement to existing imaging techniques.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "361", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "370", "date_publication": "Tue Apr 03 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12711756", "date": "May 2012", "date_current_version": "Wed May 09 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "361 - 370", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Robin Dahlback", "Tonny Rubaek", "Mikael Persson", "Jan Stake"], "keywords": ["approximation theory", "submillimetre wave antennas", "terahertz wave imaging", "Born approximation", "antenna footprint", "complex permittivity", "dielectric targets", "frequency 346 GHz", "imaging algorithm", "low-contrast targets", "optical focusing", "terahertz imaging", "Antenna measurements", "Antennas", "Approximation methods", "Frequency measurement", "Imaging", "Mixers", "Scattering", "Born approximation", "imaging", "sub-millimeter", "terahertz (THz)", ""], "arnumber": "6177710"}
