In this paper, we present a comprehensive mathematical model of the doubly corrugated SSPP (DC-SSPP) structure derived from full-field analysis. Based on the proposed model, a complete characterization of the structure is carried out and properties such as dispersion relationships and S-parameters are obtained. The results show the existence of slow light modes in the DC-SSPP structure. Discrete sub-wavelength transmission bands, and sometimes sharp transmission peaks with strong EM field localization can also be achieved under certain device designs. They are compared with the simulation results obtained from the CST software package developed by Computer Simulation Technology AG. The validation as well as limitations of the derived results is also discussed in detail.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "345", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "354", "date_publication": "Tue Apr 03 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12711757", "date": "May 2012", "date_current_version": "Wed May 09 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "345 - 354", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Zhao Xu", "Kyungjun Song", "Pinaki Mazumder"], "keywords": ["S-parameters", "polaritons", "surface plasmons", "terahertz wave devices", "CST software package", "Computer Simulation Technology AG", "DC-SSPP structure", "S-parameters", "doubly corrugated spoof surface plasmon polariton", "fast signal processing", "full field analysis", "subwavelength transmission", "Dispersion", "Equations", "Mathematical model", "Periodic structures", "Plasmons", "Resonant frequency", "Software", "Dispersion relationship", "S-parameters", "doubly corrugated spoof surface plasmon polariton (DC-SSPP)", "full-field analysis", ""], "arnumber": "6177711"}
