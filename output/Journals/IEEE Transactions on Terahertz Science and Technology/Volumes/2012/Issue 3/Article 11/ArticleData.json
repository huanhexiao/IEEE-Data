A propagation effective index shift is observed between corrugated and non-corrugated planar Goubau lines. Influence of the corrugation geometrical parameters is studied. Two original methods based on Bianco-Parodi differential measurements or on THz interferometer structure are validated. Finally, the effect of corrugating lines on unwanted substrate modes reject is discussed with experimental and parametric simulation studies. The wave stronger \u201cattachment\u201d in corrugated configurations is demonstrated.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "340", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "344", "date_publication": "Wed Apr 04 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12711759", "date": "May 2012", "date_current_version": "Wed May 09 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "340 - 344", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Simon Laurette", "Anthony Treizebre", "Bertrand Bocquet"], "keywords": ["planar waveguides", "surface plasmons", "terahertz spectroscopy", "terahertz waves", "transmission lines", "Bianco-Parodi differential measurements", "THz interferometer structure", "THz wave confinement", "THz wave slowing", "corrugated Goubau lines", "corrugation geometrical parameter", "electromagnetic wave focusing", "planar Goubau line", "propagation effective index shift", "Corrugated surfaces", "Dielectrics", "Glass", "Indexes", "Plasmons", "Propagation losses", "Substrates", "Corrugated waveguide", "planar Goubau lines", "plasmonics", "substrate mode", "terahertz (THz)", ""], "arnumber": "6178821"}
