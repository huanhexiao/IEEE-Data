The band stop filters were modeled and designed using the generalized multipole technique. The frequency and angle-dependent transmission characteristics of the photonic crystal structures were characterized in a THz time-domain spectrometer.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "203", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "207", "date_publication": "Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2012", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12571229", "date": "March 2012", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 01 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "203 - 207", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Matthias Stecher", "Christian Jansen", "Mehdi Ahmadi-Boroujeni", "Richard Lwin", "Alessio Stefani", "Martin Koch", "Graham E.
