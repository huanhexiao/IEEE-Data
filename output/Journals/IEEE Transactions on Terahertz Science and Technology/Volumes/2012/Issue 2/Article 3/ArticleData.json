This frequency-multiplied source is driven by a W-band synthesizer followed by a power amplifier that delivers 350-450 mW (25.5-26.5 dBm) and a cascade of three balanced frequency triplers. The first stage tripler is based on four power-combined six-anode GaAs Schottky diode devices, and the second stage tripler is based on two four-anode GaAs devices. The output tripler uses a single unbiased device featuring two anodes monolithically integrated onto a thin GaAs membrane. The source delivers a record at 2.58 THz at room temperature. This frequency multiplied source is analyzed with a Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) and the unwanted harmonics are found to be at least 29 dB below the desired signal. This source, when used as the local oscillator for a hot-electron bolometer mixer, will enable heterodyne instruments for future space missions to map the cosmologically-important 2.675 THz HD molecular line.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "177", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "185", "date_publication": "Mon Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2012", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12571227", "date": "March 2012", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 01 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "177 - 185", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Alain Maestrini", "Imran Mehdi", "Jos\u00e9 V.
