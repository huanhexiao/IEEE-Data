In autumn 2011, Band 3 and Band 4 will be equipped with state-of-the-art sideband-separating mixers with 8 GHz intermediate frequency (IF) bandwidth. For Band 3 a side- band-separating mixer has been developed within the European project AMSTAR+ in order to replace the currently employed single-sideband mixer. The new mixer has an IF bandwidth twice as large as the current one, and two sidebands, thus doubling the continuum sensitivity of the receiver. The mixer currently installed in Band 4 will simply be upgraded to 8 GHz IF bandwidth by changing its IF components.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "215", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "221", "date_publication": "Thu Feb 16 00:00:00 EST 2012", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12571225", "date": "March 2012", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 01 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "215 - 221", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Doris Maier", "Julien Reverdy", "Dominique Billon-Pierron", "Arnaud Barbier"], "keywords": ["millimetre wave mixers", "millimetre wave receivers", "radiotelescopes", "EMIR Band 3 mixer", "EMIR Band 4 mixer", "European project AMSTAR+", "IRAM telescope", "bandwidth 8 GHz", "eight mixer receiver", "intermediate frequency bandwidth", "multiband millimeter wave receiver", "sideband separating mixer", "size 30 m", "Junctions", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Magnetic tunneling", "Mixers", "Noise", "Radio frequency", "Temperature measurement", "Millimeter wave receiver", "sideband-separating mixers", "superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) mixers", "wide IF band", ""], "arnumber": "6153420"}
