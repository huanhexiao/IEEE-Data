Reflection intensity measurements from a sample coated with epoxy resin show that optical coherence tomography using near-infrared (IR) light and THz waves can detect the hidden rust region, since near-IR light and THz waves can pass through the coating. This region can be reproduced by so-called THz imaging without contact. In contrast, neither X-ray fluorescence nor Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy can detect the rust, because of the strong X-ray and IR absorption peaks of the coating.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "242", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "249", "date_publication": "Mon Jan 16 00:00:00 EST 2012", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12571219", "date": "March 2012", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 01 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "242 - 249", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Norikazu Fuse", "Tetsuo Fukuchi", "Tsuguhiro Takahashi", "Maya Mizuno", "Kaori Fukunaga"], "keywords": ["corrosion protection", "corrosion protective coatings", "infrared spectra", "optical tomography", "plates (structures)", "resins", "steel", "terahertz wave imaging", "terahertz wave spectra", "IR absorption peaks", "X-ray absorption peaks", "coated steel plates", "epoxy resin", "hidden rust region detection", "near-infrared spectra", "noncontact analysis methods", "optical coherence tomography", "reflection intensity measurements", "terahertz imaging", "Absorption", "Coatings", "Optical surface waves", "Spectroscopy", "Steel", "Surface treatment", "Surface waves", "Infrared (IR) spectroscopy", "X-ray fluorescence", "non-contact detection", "optical coherence tomography", "rust", "terahertz (THz) waves", ""], "arnumber": "6132447"}
