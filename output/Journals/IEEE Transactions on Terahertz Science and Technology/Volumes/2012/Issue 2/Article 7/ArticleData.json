Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) Band 5 is a dual polarization, sideband separation (2SB) receiver based on all Niobium (Nb) superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) tunnel junction mixers, providing 16 GHz of instantaneous RF bandwidth for astronomy observations. The 2SB mixer for each polarization employs a quadrature configuration. The sideband separation occurs at the output of the IF hybrid that has integrated bias-T for biasing the mixers, and is produced using superconducting thin-film technology. Experimental verification of the Band 5 cold cartridge performed together with warm cartridge assembly, confirms that the system noise temperature is below 45 K over most of the RF band, which is less than 5 photon noise (5 hf/k). This is to our knowledge, the best results reported at these frequencies. The measurement of the sideband rejection indicates that the sideband rejection is better than 10 dB over 90% of the observational band.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "208", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "214", "date_publication": "Thu Feb 16 00:00:00 EST 2012", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "12571222", "date": "March 2012", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 01 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "208 - 214", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Bhushan Billade", "Olle Nystrom", "Denis Meledin", "Erik Sundin", "Igor Lapkin", "Mathias Fredrixon", "Vincent Desmaris", "Hawal Rashid", "Magnus Strandberg", "Sven-Erik Ferm", "Alexey Pavolotsky", "Victor Belitsky"], "keywords": ["MIMIC", "millimetre wave mixers", "radioastronomical techniques", "radiotelescopes", "superconducting junction devices", "superconducting microwave devices", "ALMA band 5 production cartridge", "Atacama large millimeter/submillimeter array", "astronomy observation", "frequency 16 GHz", "frequency 163 GHz to 211 GHz", "instantaneous RF bandwidth", "superconductor-insulator-superconductor tunnel junction mixer", "Amplitude modulation", "Couplers", "Mixers", "Noise", "Radio frequency", "Receivers", "Temperature measurement", "Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA)", "astronomy instruments", "millimeter-wave mixers", "superconducting devices", "superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) mixers", "terahertz system", "thin-film circuits", ""], "arnumber": "6153417"}
