The proposed computational method combines an optoelectronic solver and a full-wave electromagnetic solver to rigorously model continuous wave (CW) THz photomixer sources. In this hybrid computational approach, the photomixer source is modeled in a rigorous manner without any approximation. The optoelectronic solver is used to find absorbed optical intensity and optical carrier generation rate inside the fast photoconductive region through solving an optical scattering problem. Then, the equations governing the charge carrier transport inside the photoconductor are solved to give THz photo-current by considering realistic material parameters. Finally, through a full-wave electromagnetic solver, and using calculated photo-current from the optoelectronic simulator, antenna parameters and radiated THz power are obtained. Using the proposed hybrid simulation method the effects of photomixer parameters on the THz photo-current and radiated power is rigorously investigated for several geometries. Moreover, results of a parametric study on various factors such as carrier lifetime of material, incident optical power density, applied bias voltage, THz beat frequency, and the gap size are presented. The method can be used for accurate design refinement at pre-fabrication stage.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "605", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "616", "date_publication": "Wed Sep 19 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13167843", "date": "Nov. 2012", "date_current_version": "Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "605 - 616", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Mehrnoosh Khabiri", "Mohammad Neshat", "Safieddin Safavi-Naeini"], "keywords": ["carrier lifetime", "numerical analysis", "optoelectronic devices", "photoconductivity", "photoemission", "submillimetre wave antennas", "THz photo-current", "absorbed optical intensity", "antenna parameter", "carrier lifetime", "charge carrier transport", "continuous wave terahertz photomixer", "full-wave electromagnetic solver", "gap size", "hybrid computational approach", "hybrid computational simulation", "hybrid numerical simulation method", "incident optical power density", "integrated terahertz photomixer antenna", "material parameter", "optical carrier generation", "optical scattering problem", "optoelectronic simulator", "optoelectronic solver", "photoconductive region", "photomixer parameter", "photomixer source", "radiated THz power", "Broadband antennas", "Charge carrier processes", "Computational modeling", "Mathematical model", "Optical scattering", "Carrier transport", "photomixer source", "terahertz", ""], "arnumber": "6307909"}
