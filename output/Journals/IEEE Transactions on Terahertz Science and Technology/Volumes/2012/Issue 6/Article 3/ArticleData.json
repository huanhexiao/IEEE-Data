The receiver employs 2SB superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) mixers with a typical single sideband (SSB) noise temperature of 60 K and image rejection ratio above 10 dB over the frequency band. Digital techniques are extensively applied in this receiver system for excellent operational stability and efficiency. They include fast Fourier spectrometers, digital LO and digital bias supplies. In our knowledge this is the first 2SB multibeam millimeter wavelength receiver in the world. This receiver has been successfully put into observation and its considerable enhancement of mapping speed has been demonstrated.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "593", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "604", "date_publication": "Thu Sep 27 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13167844", "date": "Nov. 2012", "date_current_version": "Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "593 - 604", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Wenlei Shan", "Ji Yang", "Shengcai Shi", "Qijun Yao", "Yingxi Zuo", "Zhenhui Lin", "Shanhuai Chen", "Xuguo Zhang", "Wenying Duan", "Aiqing Cao", "Sheng Li", "Zhenqiang Li", "Jie Liu", "Jiaqiang Zhong"], "keywords": ["microwave mixers", "microwave receivers", "superconducting microwave devices", "2SB multibeam millimeter wavelength receiver", "3 &#x00D7", "3 multibeam sideband separation superconducting receiver-SSAR", "digital LO", "digital bias supply", "digital technique", "fast Fourier spectrometer", "frequency 85 GHz to 115 GHz", "frequency band", "image rejection ratio", "mapping speed", "millimeter-wave radio astronomy", "multibeam 2SB SIS receiver", "receiver system", "superconducting spectroscopic array receiver", "superconductor-insulator-superconductor mixer", "typical single sideband noise temperature", "Local oscillators", "Millimeter wave technology", "Mixers", "Optical mixing", "Radio astronomy", "Receivers", "Superconducting devices", "Heterodyne instruments", "imaging arrays", "low noise detectors", ""], "arnumber": "6313968"}
