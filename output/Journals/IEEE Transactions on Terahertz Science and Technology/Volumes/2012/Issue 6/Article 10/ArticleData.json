The wave-guiding mixer structure is a modified parallel plate waveguide (PPWG) in which the top plate is replaced by a periodic array of sub-wavelength nano-slits. The substrate of the PPWG is made of a fast photoconductive material in which laser photomixing/absorption occurs. The characteristic equation of the modified PPWG when used as a THz waveguide is derived analytically, and its guided modes are studied in details over THz range of frequencies. The accuracy of the analytical results are verified by comparison with full-wave numerical simulations. The criteria for choosing the suitable mode for photomixing application are also discussed. Finally, based on dyadic Green's function representation, a systematic approach is provided for calculating the amplitude of the guided modes that are excited by an arbitrary photocurrent.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "652", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "658", "date_publication": "Thu Nov 15 00:00:00 EST 2012", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "13167849", "date": "Nov. 2012", "date_current_version": "Mon Dec 10 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "652 - 658", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Saman Jafarlou", "Mohammad Neshat", "Safieddin Safavi-Naeini"], "keywords": ["Green's function methods", "absorption", "numerical analysis", "parallel plate waveguides", "photoconducting materials", "terahertz materials", "PPWG", "THz photoconductive source", "absorption", "arbitrary photocurrent", "characteristic equation", "dyadic Green's function representation", "fast analysis method", "fast photoconductive material", "full-wave numerical simulations", "guided wave analysis", "laser photomixing", "modified parallel plate waveguide", "nanoscale slit loaded waveguide", "radiation analysis", "subwavelength nanoslit periodic array", "systematic approach", "terahertz waveguide", "waveguiding mixer structure", "Dispersion", "Green's function methods", "Millimeter wave technology", "Photoconductivity", "Plasmons", "Propagation constant", "Dyadic Green's function", "THz source", "THz waveguide", "millimeter wave", "photoconductor", "photomixer", "plasmonic mode", ""], "arnumber": "6352944"}
