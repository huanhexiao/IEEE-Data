This detector is essentially a traditional NbN bolometer element that operates under the influence of a microwave pump. The injected microwave power serves the dual purpose of enhancing the detector sensitivity and reading out the impedance changes of the device in response to incident THz radiation. We have measured an optical Noise Equivalent Power of 4 pW/ \u221aHz for our detector at a bath temperature of 4.2 K. The measurement frequency was 0.83 THz and the modulation frequency was 1.48 kHz. The readout scheme is versatile and facilitates both high-speed operation as well as multi-pixel applications.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "81", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "84", "date_publication": "Tue Jan 06 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14854049", "date": "Jan. 2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 14 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "81 - 84", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Alexander Shurakov", "Cheuk-yu Edward Tong", "Paul Grimes", "Raymond Blundell", "Gregory Golt'sman"], "keywords": ["bolometers", "microwave detectors", "microwave measurement", "microwave propagation", "niobium compounds", "readout electronics", "superconducting microwave devices", "superconducting mixers", "superconducting thin films", "terahertz wave detectors", "thin film sensors", "HEB mixers", "NbN", "THz detector", "THz radiation", "frequency 0.83 THz", "frequency 1.48 kHz", "hot electron bolometer", "hot electron bolometric direct detector", "microwave pump", "microwave reflection readout scheme", "multi-pixel applications", "noise equivalent power", "optical NEP measurement", "superconducting thin film", "temperature 4.2 K", "Bolometers", "Detectors", "Frequency modulation", "Microwave measurement", "Mixers", "Temperature measurement", "Voltage measurement", "Hot electron bolometer (HEB)", "THz detector", "microwave readout", "superconducting detector", ""], "arnumber": "7001662"}
