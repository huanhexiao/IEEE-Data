In our architecture, the two-terminal CEB has been integrated in the periodic unit cell of the FSS structure and is impedance matched to the embedding impedance seen by it and provides a resonant interaction with the incident submillimeter radiation. The detector array has been designed to operate in background noise limited condition for incident powers of 20 pW to 80 pW, making it possible to use the same pixel in both photometric and spectrometric configurations. We present high-frequency and dc simulations of our system, together with fabrication details. The frequency response of the FSS array, optical response measurements with hot/cold load in front of optical window, and with variable-temperature blackbody source inside cryostat are presented. A comparison of the optical response to the CEB model and estimations of noise equivalent power (NEP) is also presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "145", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "152", "date_publication": "Mon Oct 27 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14854053", "date": "Jan. 2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 14 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "145 - 152", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Sumedh Mahashabde", "Alexander Sobolev", "Andreas Bengtsson", "Daniel Andr\u00e9n", "Michael A.
