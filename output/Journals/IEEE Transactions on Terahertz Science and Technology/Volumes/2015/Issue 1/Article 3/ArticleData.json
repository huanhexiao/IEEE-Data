Superconducting circuits offer low loss properties, well-controlled nonlinearity, and frequency tunability in the microwave and mm-wave frequency ranges. An interesting spin-off of superconducting metamaterials is going to be quantum metamaterials comprised of arrays of superconducting qubits. This direction is an emerging new field for fundamental studies in quantum optics using microwaves.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "22", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "Thu Dec 18 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14854045", "date": "Jan. 2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 14 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "22 - 26", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Alexey V.
