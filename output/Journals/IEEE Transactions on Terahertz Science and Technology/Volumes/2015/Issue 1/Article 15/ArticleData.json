Using a raster scanning heterodyne detector, the imager captures lensless transmission holograms formed by the interaction of a highly coherent, monochromatic beam with 3-D printed structures. Digital hologram reconstructions from two structures were used to measure the imager's modulation transfer function and to show that terahertz digital holography can provide sub-millimeter resolution images of voids within visually opaque printed structures. As a demonstration we imaged embedded air- and lossy dielectric filled-voids whose refractive indices differ from the host material.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "110", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "116", "date_publication": "Tue Nov 11 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14880706", "date": "Jan. 2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 14 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "110 - 116", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Martin S.
