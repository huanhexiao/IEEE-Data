The modulation concept is demonstrated by using several metamaterial structures with a different effective capacitance of the split gap, thus imitating a metamaterial of tunable frequency. The proposed modulation scheme can be employed in the fabrication of a fast narrow-band terahertz modulator. The influence of Fabry-Pe\u0301rot resonances in the dielectric substrate on the parameters of the possible metamaterial-based modulator is analyzed in the terahertz region. Our results demonstrate that tuning the dielectric plate parameters allows for the optimization of the modulator performance. The presented modulation scheme based on frequency-tunable metamaterial offers a high modulation depth (95% at 425 GHz) with the resonant frequency tuning as small as ~ 15%. Measurement results are found in agreement with calculations.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "124", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "130", "date_publication": "Tue Nov 25 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14854050", "date": "Jan. 2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 14 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "124 - 130", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Dalius Seliuta", "Dovil\u0117 Zimkait\u0117", "Gediminas \u0160lekas", "And\u017eej Urbanovi\u010d", "Jan Devenson", "\u017dilvinas Kancleris"], "keywords": ["Fabry-Perot resonators", "capacitance", "dielectric materials", "optical arrays", "optical fabrication", "optical metamaterials", "optical modulation", "optical tuning", "optimisation", "terahertz metamaterials", "Fabry-Perot resonant frequency tuning", "dielectric plate parameter tuning", "effective capacitance", "fast narrow-band terahertz modulator fabrication", "optical transmission properties", "optimization", "split-ring resonator planar arrays", "terahertz metamaterial", "Frequency modulation", "Gallium arsenide", "Optimization", "Resonant frequency", "Substrates", "Tuning", "Fabry&#x2013", "P&#x00E9", "rot resonance (FPR)", "Metamaterial (MM)", "Terahertz (THz)", "modulation", "split ring resonator (SRR)", ""], "arnumber": "6966814"}
