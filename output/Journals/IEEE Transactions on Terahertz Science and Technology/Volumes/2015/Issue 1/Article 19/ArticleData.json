A centralized approach with optical source-sharing simplifies the implementation and cost of nondestructive inspection platforms, where several sensing units have to work in the same facility, such as factories and security controls. The cost of such a distribution system is evaluated, its feasibility experimentally demonstrated, and key features relevant to the system performance are discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "137", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "144", "date_publication": "Thu Dec 18 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14863596", "date": "Jan. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 19 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "137 - 144", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Alexander Bockelt", "Jesus Palac\u00ed L\u00f3pez", "Borja Vidal"], "keywords": ["fibre optic sensors", "inspection", "nondestructive testing", "terahertz wave spectra", "THz time-domain spectroscopy", "fiber centralized architecture", "nondestructive inspection platforms", "optical fiber", "optical source-sharing", "parallel inspection units", "parallel terahertz sensors", "security controls", "sensing units", "signal distribution", "system performance", "Dispersion", "Optical pulses", "Optical receivers", "Optical sensors", "Principal component analysis", "Ultrafast optics", "Fiber optics", "THz spectrometry", "signal transmission lines", ""], "arnumber": "6990650"}
