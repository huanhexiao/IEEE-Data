The condition independent of frequency in case of a single Gaussian beam on an optical axis has been known, but that in case of a beam propagated off the axis or tilted beam, which appears in a wide field-of-view (FOV) telescope, has not been known. We first show relations between an arbitrary electric field on an object plane and an induced one on an image plane after passing through a lens with calculating Fresnel diffraction integrals. If the lens formula is met, there is a one-to-one correspondence between points on the object and image plane. This result enables to use geometrical optical methods. The condition and relations derived here are confirmed by simulations. We also applied them to a wide-FOV telescope.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "57", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "63", "date_publication": "Thu Nov 20 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14854051", "date": "Jan. 2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 14 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "57 - 63", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Hiroaki Imada", "Makoto Nagai", "Masaru Kino", "Masumichi Seta", "Shun Ishii", "Naomasa Nakai"], "keywords": ["Fresnel diffraction", "Gaussian distribution", "geometrical optics", "image processing", "laser beams", "lenses", "object detection", "optical images", "radiotelescopes", "Fresnel diffraction integral calculation", "Gaussian beam propagation", "arbitrary electric field", "geometrical optical methods", "image plane", "lens formula", "object plane", "optical axis", "optical systems", "wide field-of-view radio telescopes", "Diffraction", "Geometrical optics", "Lenses", "Mirrors", "Optical diffraction", "Optical imaging", "Telescopes", "Electromagnetic diffraction", ""], "arnumber": "6960921"}
