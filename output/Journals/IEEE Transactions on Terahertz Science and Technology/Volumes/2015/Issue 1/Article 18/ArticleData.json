So far, the THz passband filters based on metamaterial and surface plasmon suffer from the broad passband. In this paper, we propose a THz filter with calculated pass band of (\u0394f/f) <; 0.2% together with a peak transmission above 70% and demonstrate the experimental results with (\u0394f/f) <; 0.3% limited by the measurement system. The calculated value of (\u0394f/f) is at least one order of magnitude smaller than the previous results. The unique filtering capability was attributed to the guided-mode resonance that is generated by metallic gratings and a waveguide. Compared to the dielectric gratings, the metallic gratings with a narrow air slit are proved to effectively suppress off-resonance wavelength transmission resulting in a bandpass filtering response. In addition, a weak waveguide is found to benefit a narrow-linewidth filtering. Fabrication method of metallic gratings on membrane in a size of several cm was developed and the experimental results show reasonably good agreement with the simulation for a filter with (\u0394f/f) <; 0.3% limited by the spectral resolution and detectability of our measurement system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "131", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "136", "date_publication": "Fri Nov 14 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14854041", "date": "Jan. 2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 14 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "131 - 136", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Shichao Song", "Fuhe Sun", "Qin Chen", "Yaxin Zhang"], "keywords": ["band-pass filters", "submillimetre wave filters", "surface plasmons", "terahertz metamaterials", "terahertz spectroscopy", "waveguide filters", "THz passband filters", "THz spectroscopy", "air slit", "bandpass filtering response", "dielectric gratings", "filtering capability", "guided-mode resonance", "measurement system", "metallic gratings", "metamaterial", "narrow-linewidth filtering", "off-resonance wavelength transmission", "spectral resolving capability", "surface plasmon", "terahertz bandpass filtering", "terahertz spectroscopy", "Absorption", "Dielectrics", "Gratings", "Metals", "Optical waveguides", "Passband", "Refractive index", "Band-pass filter", "guided mode resonance", "terahertz (THz)", ""], "arnumber": "6957612"}
