The receiver integrates a 300 GHz RF amplifier with a balun, a down-conversion mixer with an IF amplifier, and a local oscillator, all on a single chip. The transmitter is composed of the identical circuit blocks of RF amplifier and oscillator in addition to an up-conversion mixer. Compared to previous integrated receivers and transmitters reported at above 200 GHz, the proposed work includes the on-chip local oscillator and mixers operating at a fundamental mode. This simplifies the system architecture, thus not only reducing the chip area and DC consumption but also improving the RF performance such as high conversion gain, low spurious levels, and low noise figure. The receiver exhibits a peak conversion gain of 26 dB at 298 GHz, 3-dB bandwidth of 20 GHz, and noise figure of 12.0-16.3 dB at IF frequency from 1.1 to 7.7 GHz. The transmitter exhibits peak conversion gain of 25 dB, 3 dB bandwidth of 18 GHz, and output power of -2.3 dBm. The DC power consumption of the receiver and transmitter are 482 and 452 mW, respectively.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "92", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "101", "date_publication": "Tue Nov 11 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14854040", "date": "Jan. 2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 14 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "92 - 101", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Sooyeon Kim", "Jongwon Yun", "Daekeun Yoon", "Moonil Kim", "Jae-Sung Rieh", "Miguel Urteaga", "Sanggeun Jeon"], "keywords": ["III-V semiconductors", "baluns", "heterojunction bipolar transistors", "indium compounds", "mixers (circuits)", "oscillators", "radiofrequency amplifiers", "receivers", "transmitters", "DHBT process", "IF amplifier", "InP", "RF performance", "balun", "bandwidth 18 GHz", "bandwidth 20 GHz", "double-heterojunction bipolar transistor", "down-conversion mixer", "frequency 1.1 GHz to 7.7 GHz", "frequency 298 GHz", "frequency 300 GHz", "gain 25 dB", "gain 26 dB", "high conversion gain", "identical circuit blocks", "imaging applications", "integrated heterodyne receiver and transmitter", "low noise figure", "low spurious levels", "noise figure 12 dB to 16.3 dB", "on-chip fundamental local oscillator", "power 452 mW", "power 482 mW", "size 250 nm", "up-conversion mixer", "wideband communication", "Frequency measurement", "Gain", "Impedance matching", "Mixers", "Radio frequency", "Receivers", "Transmitters", "Fundamental local oscillator", "fundamental mixer", "heterodyne receiver", "heterodyne transmitter", "millimeter-wave amplifier", "terahertz (THz) monolithic integrated circuit", ""], "arnumber": "6953262"}
