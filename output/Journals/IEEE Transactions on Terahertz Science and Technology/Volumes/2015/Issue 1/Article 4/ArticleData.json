A setup based on a commercial vector network analyzer (VNA), a circulator and a low noise amplifier (LNA) has allowed to increase the dynamic of the VNA and to perform accurate one-port measurements across a high dynamic range of the SIS mixers IF band. The mixers were biased in three different regions of their unpumped IV curve to obtain three known impedances which are close to the classical calibration SOLT standards (Short, Open, Load, Thru): the reference plane was located at the SIS junction itself and the calibration procedure allowed to calibrate out all IF circuitry of the measurement setup, including the on-chip SIS mixer intrinsic capacitance and inductance without requiring to thermally cycle and open the cryostat to locate and measure the different calibration standards. Thus, the devised method provides a simple and direct measurement of the SIS mixers IF impedance which can be used for quick, accurate and highly repeatable IF characterization of any type of millimeter and sub-millimeter wave SIS mixers. The measurement method is described and the experimental results of the IF output impedances of 3 mm band DSB and SSB mixers with 4 GHz wide IFs (across 4-8 GHz) are presented and compared with simulated predictions obtained from combining Tucker's SIS mixer theory and accurate electromagnetic modeling of the mixer structure.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "36", "date_publication": "Tue Dec 02 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14854044", "date": "Jan. 2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 14 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "27 - 36", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Patrice Serres", "Alessandro Navarrini", "Yves Bortolotti", "Olivier Garnier"], "keywords": ["calibration", "cryogenic electronics", "cryostats", "low noise amplifiers", "network analysers", "superconductor-insulator-superconductor mixers", "DSB mixer", "IF characterization", "IF circuitry", "IF output impedance", "LNA", "SOLT standard", "SSB mixer", "Tucker SIS mixer theory", "VNA", "calibration procedure", "cryogenically cooled superconductor-insulator-superconductor mixer", "cryostat", "double sideband mixer", "electromagnetic modeling", "frequency 4 GHz", "high dynamic range", "intermediate frequency impedance", "low noise amplifier", "millimeter wave SIS mixer", "on-chip SIS mixer intrinsic capacitance", "one-port measurement setup", "short open load thru standard", "single sideband mixer", "submillimeter wave SIS mixer", "unpumped IV curve", "vector network analyzer", "Amplitude modulation", "Impedance", "Junctions", "Mixers", "Noise", "Radio frequency", "Receivers", "Double side band (DSB) and single side band (SSB) tuning", "intermediate frequency (IF) impedance", "superconductor&#x2013", "insulator&#x2013", "superconductor (SIS) mixer", "vector network analyzer (VNA) measurements", ""], "arnumber": "6971243"}
