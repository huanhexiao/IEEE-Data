The model is obtained by using a Fourier optics representation of the electromagnetic field in the focal plane in conjunction with a recently developed equivalent network representation for the interaction of plane waves with distributed absorbers. The model is validated by comparisons with numerical full-wave simulations. Finally, the model is used to design a few architectures based on lens-coupled Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs), which show high absorption efficiency over a large bandwidth.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "573", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "583", "date_publication": "Wed Jul 08 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15323633", "date": "July 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jul 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "573 - 583", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Nuria Llombart", "Beatriz Bl\u00e1zquez", "Angelo Freni", "Andrea Neto"], "keywords": ["Fourier transform optics", "electromagnetic fields", "focal planes", "lenses", "terahertz wave detectors", "Fourier optics", "THz focusing systems", "analytical spectral model", "bandwidth", "distributed absorber analysis", "distributed absorbers", "electromagnetic field", "equivalent network representation", "focal plane", "high absorption efficiency", "lens-coupled kinetic inductance detectors", "numerical full-wave simulation", "plane wave interaction", "Dielectrics", "Focusing", "Geometry", "Lenses", "Strips", "Surface waves", "Focusing systems", "Fourier optics", "THz absorbers", ""], "arnumber": "7152993"}
