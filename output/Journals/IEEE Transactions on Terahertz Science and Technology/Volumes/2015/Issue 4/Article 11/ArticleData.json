Due to the one-dimensional characteristics, the photoexcited carriers experiences multiple carrier interactions in the transverse direction such that strong carrier-carrier interactions are expected to play an important role in the NW carrier recombination. Here, using ultrafast optical-pump and terahertz-probe spectroscopy, we show that the Auger scattering significantly reduces the trap-mediated decay process. Systematic studies on bulk Si, bundled, individual, and encapsulated (reduced surface-trap density) SiNWs reveal that the effect of Auger recombination exhibits strong pump-fluence dependence depending on the surface-treatment condition.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "605", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "612", "date_publication": "Mon May 18 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15323641", "date": "July 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jul 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "605 - 612", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Chihun In", "Jungmok Seo", "Hyukho Kwon", "Jeongmook Choi", "Sangwan Sim", "Jaeseok Kim", "Taeyong Kim", "Taeyoon Lee", "Hyunyong Choi"], "keywords": ["Auger effect", "electron-hole recombination", "elemental semiconductors", "high-speed optical techniques", "nanowires", "optical pumping", "silicon", "terahertz wave spectra", "Auger recombination", "Auger scattering", "Si", "counterbalanced effect", "multiple carrier interactions", "one-dimensional characteristics", "optoelectronic properties", "photoexcited carriers", "silicon nanowires", "surface trap", "surface-treatment condition", "terahertz probe spectroscopy", "transverse terahertz carrier dynamics", "trap-mediated decay process", "ultrafast optical-pump spectroscopy", "Optical pumping", "Optical scattering", "Silicon", "Spectroscopy", "Substrates", "Ultrafast optics", "Silicon nanowires", "terahertz (THz)", "ultrafast spectroscopy", ""], "arnumber": "7109945"}
