With the recent severe metal density rules the problem has become more severe. Hence, antenna engineers need to move toward systems-in-package involving off-chip antenna solutions for high-efficiency performance. We introduce a new metal beam-lead interconnection technique which offers better matching control and lower loss at higher frequencies. The metal beam-lead interconnection appears to be a good solution for CMOS circuits at millimeter- and submillimeter-wave frequencies where off-chip connections are required. In this paper, we report performance of a 150 GHz CMOS transmitter which uses metal beam-lead interconnect between a high efficiency silicon antenna and a CMOS transmitter.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "637", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "644", "date_publication": "Mon Jun 29 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15323637", "date": "July 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jul 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "637 - 644", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Nacer Chahat", "Adrian Tang", "Choonsup Lee", "Ronan Sauleau", "Goutam Chattopadhyay"], "keywords": ["CMOS integrated circuits", "antennas", "elemental semiconductors", "silicon", "CMOS circuits", "CMOS transmitter", "antenna engineering", "beam-lead interconnects", "frequency 150 GHz", "high efficiency silicon antenna", "high-efficiency performance", "matching control", "metal beam-lead interconnection", "metal beam-lead interconnection technique", "off-chip antenna solutions", "off-chip connections", "on-chip antennas", "space instruments", "submillimeter-wave frequencies", "systems-in-package", "CMOS integrated circuits", "Dipole antennas", "Impedance", "Metals", "Silicon", "System-on-chip", "CMOS RFIC", "Off-chip antenna", "beam&#x2013", "lead interconnection", "millimeter-wave", "on-chip antenna", "silicon micromachined antenna", "submillimeter-wave", "transmitter", ""], "arnumber": "7138651"}
