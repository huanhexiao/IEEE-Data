The switchable resonator concept by using three coupled-lines topology is proposed and adopted in the switch design. Equivalent circuit models are introduced for analyzing the operation mechanism of proposed switch. The fabricated SPDT switch features measured insertion loss of 4.2 dB including RF pad losses, isolation of 19 dB, return loss of better than 10 dB, simulated P1 dB of 9.2 dBm, and zero power consumption. To the best of authors' knowledge, this switch achieves the highest operating frequency and smallest chip size among reported SPDT switches in CMOS and BiCMOS technologies.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "649", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "651", "date_publication": "Wed Jun 10 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15323643", "date": "July 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jul 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "649 - 651", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Fanyi Meng", "Kaixue Ma", "Kiat Seng Yeo", "Chirn Chye Boon", "Wei Meng Lim", "Shanshan Xu"], "keywords": ["CMOS integrated circuits", "equivalent circuits", "field effect MIMIC", "switches", "RF pad losses", "SPDT switch", "bulk CMOS technology", "coupled-lines topology", "equivalent circuit models", "frequency 220 GHz to 285 GHz", "return loss", "single-pole double-throw switch", "size 65 nm", "switchable resonator", "zero power consumption", "CMOS integrated circuits", "Insertion loss", "Loss measurement", "Ports (Computers)", "Switches", "Switching circuits", "Transmission line measurements", "CMOS", "coupled-lines", "miniaturization", "silicon", "single-pole double-throw (SPDT) switches", "switchable resonator", ""], "arnumber": "7121033"}
