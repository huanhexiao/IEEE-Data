The FRLODL features two reflective surfaces with spatially separated incoming and outgoing beams. It has been manufactured using CNC machining. A linear dependence of the optical delay on the rotation angle allows a straightforward extraction of the conversion factor between the acquisition time (in ms) and the terahertz pulse time (in ps). We also discuss the accuracy of the rotary delay line detailing the possible sources of imprecision. The FRLODL has been tested using rotation speeds of up to 48 Hz, corresponding to an acquisition rate of up to 192 Hz with four blades incorporated on the same disk. At high speeds we observe a decrease of the bandwidth due to the limitations of the electronics, in particular, the transimpedance amplifier. An error analysis is performed by experimentally evaluating the signal-to-noise ratio and the dynamic range. With regard to the applications of the FRLODL, we first present observation of the evaporation of liquids, namely water, acetone and methanol. We then demonstrate monitoring of the spray painting process. Finally, detection of fast moving objects at 1 m/s and their thickness characterization are presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "564", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "572", "date_publication": "Mon Jun 22 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15323630", "date": "July 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jul 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "564 - 572", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Hichem Guerboukha", "Andrey Markov", "Hang Qu", "Maksim Skorobogatiy"], "keywords": ["error analysis", "evaporation", "optical delay lines", "optical rotation", "terahertz spectroscopy", "CNC machining", "FRLODL", "THz time-domain spectroscopy", "acetone", "conversion factor", "error analysis", "fast moving objects", "fast rotary linear optical delay line", "linear dependence", "liquid evaporation", "methanol", "reflective surfaces", "rotation angle", "signal-noise ratio", "spray painting process", "terahertz pulse time", "time resolved dynamic measurements", "transimpedance amplifier", "water", "Delay lines", "Delays", "Optical beams", "Optical pulses", "Optical refraction", "Optical variables control", "Ultrafast optics", "Delay lines", "numerical modeling", "optical design", "optical mirrors", "spectroscopy", "terahertz (THz)", "time-domain analysis", ""], "arnumber": "7130681"}
