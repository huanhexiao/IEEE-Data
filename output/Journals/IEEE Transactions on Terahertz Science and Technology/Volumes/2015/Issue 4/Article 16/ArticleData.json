The circuit output is connected to a single on-chip ring antenna radiating a record high total radiated power of 1 mW for a DC power consumption of 284 mW at 288 GHz. The circuit has a -3 dB bandwidth of 15 GHz (277-292 GHz), an EIRP of +10.2 dBm and a record radiated DC-to-RF efficiency of 0.34% for a radiating frequency multiplying chain, enabled by direct drain transistor to on-chip antenna connection. The antenna has a measured directivity of +10.2 dBi at 288 GHz. Realized in a 65-nm technology, this is the first CMOS integrated locked radiating source to achieve 1 mW of radiated power above 0.2 THz.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "645", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "648", "date_publication": "Mon Jun 15 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15323642", "date": "July 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jul 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "645 - 648", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Samuel Jameson", "Eran Socher"], "keywords": ["CMOS integrated circuits", "antennas", "terahertz wave devices", "CMOS integrated locked radiating source", "DC power consumption", "bandwidth", "direct drain transistor", "frequency 0.3 THz", "frequency 15 GHz", "frequency 288 GHz", "high total radiated power", "on-chip antenna connection", "power 1 mW", "power 284 mW", "radiating active frequency multiplier chain", "single on-chip ring antenna", "Antenna measurements", "Antennas", "CMOS integrated circuits", "Power generation", "System-on-chip", "Topology", "Transistors", "Antenna", "CMOS", "J-band", "THz", "X-band", "frequency multiplier", "mm wave", "power amplifier", "ring", "source", "sub-mm wave", ""], "arnumber": "7123677"}
