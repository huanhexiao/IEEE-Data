In this paper, a rigorous mathematical model has been proposed by performing full-field analysis on the periodically corrugated cylindrical waveguide. It has been shown that this structure has the capability of propagating localized spoof surface plasmons polariton (SSPP) mode of EM waves. The variation of band diagrams as a function of different groove dimensions has been investigated. Finally, by employing cylindrical SSPP a new polarizer controller has been designed that can be utilized to design THz Boolean gates.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "556", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "563", "date_publication": "Wed Jul 08 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15323652", "date": "July 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jul 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "556 - 563", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Mahdi Aghadjani", "Pinaki Mazumder"], "keywords": ["polaritons", "submillimetre wave propagation", "surface plasmons", "terahertz wave devices", "waveguides", "EM wave propagation", "cylindrical spoof surface plasmon polariton", "full-field analysis", "groove dimensions", "periodically corrugated cylindrical waveguide", "terahertz polarizer controller", "Dielectrics", "Dispersion", "Optical surface waves", "Optical waveguides", "Resonant frequency", "Surface waves", "Dispersion relation", "anisotropic material", "full-field analysis", "polarization", "spoof surface plasmon polariton (SSPP)", ""], "arnumber": "7152995"}
