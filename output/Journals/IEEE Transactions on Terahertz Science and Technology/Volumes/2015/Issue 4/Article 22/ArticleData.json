A novel small-size THz generator is proposed. It consists of two permanent magnets with opposite magnetization placed on a yoke forming Kittel structure. The construction provides magnetic field concentration in the active zone of a semiconductor placed closely on top of the magnets. Its capabilities of converting femtosecond pulses of the first and second harmonics of an erbium fiber laser are investigated by THz time-domain spectrometer. n-InAs and n-InSb semiconductors in the magnetic field of 0.8 T prove to be the best THz generators at 775- and 1550-nm pump wavelengths correspondingly.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "673", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "679", "date_publication": "Fri Jun 26 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15323647", "date": "July 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jul 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "673 - 679", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Valery D.
