In many cases, LO and RF optical paths share several optical components, and this imposes restrictions on the LO injection design. In this paper, this common situation has been carefully analyzed, and simple design equations have been derived in order to achieve frequency-independent designs. Due to the low power available at THz frequencies, frequency-independent LO power transmission gains importance in this band due to the need to get efficient LO injection at all frequencies. The presented quasi-optical analysis have been confirmed with physical optics simulations.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "546", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "550", "date_publication": "Mon Jun 08 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15323651", "date": "July 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jul 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "546 - 550", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Alvaro Gonzalez"], "keywords": ["heterodyne detection", "optical design techniques", "optical receivers", "frequency independent LO injection", "frequency-independent LO power transmission", "frequency-independent designs", "physical optics simulations", "quasioptical analysis", "quasioptical heterodyne systems", "Mathematical model", "Mirrors", "Mixers", "Optical receivers", "Physical optics", "Radio frequency", "Frequency-independent design", "Gaussian beams", "physical optics simulations", "quasi-optical waveguides", "submillimeter-wave technology", ""], "arnumber": "7119616"}
