The filtering properties of the present terahertz wave filter, including channel number and frequency, can be tuned by adjusting excitation of external applied magnetic field. The dynamical shift of channels with external applied magnetic field intensity is studied in detail. The transmittances of the present filter are higher than 95% for each terahertz wave frequency with a compact size of 3.8 mm \u00d7 10 mm. The designed device can possess both multichannel and tuning features, which could be of technical use in the terahertz wave communications system applications.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "551", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "555", "date_publication": "Mon Jun 01 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15323631", "date": "July 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jul 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "551 - 555", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Jiu-Sheng Li", "Han Liu", "Le Zhang"], "keywords": ["circuit tuning", "optical directional couplers", "photonic crystals", "terahertz wave devices", "waveguide filters", "Si", "cascaded photonic crystal waveguide directional couplers", "channel frequency", "channel number", "closely spaced line defect waveguides", "compact terahertz wave filter", "dynamical shift", "filtering properties", "finite difference time domain methods", "magnetic field intensity", "plane wave expansion", "silicon rods", "transmittances", "tunable-multichannel terahertz wave filter", "two-dimensional photonic crystal", "Couplings", "Dielectrics", "Magnetic domains", "Magnetic separation", "Photonic crystals", "Refractive index", "Saturation magnetization", "Terahertz filter", "terahertz tunable multichannel filter", "terahertz wave", ""], "arnumber": "7114353"}
