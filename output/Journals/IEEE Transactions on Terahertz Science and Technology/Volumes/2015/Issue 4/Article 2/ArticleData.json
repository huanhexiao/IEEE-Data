The LO is based on a quantum-cascade laser, which is mounted in a compact mechanical cryocooler. The LO provides up to 150 \u03bcW output power into a nearly Gaussian shaped beam. It covers the frequency range from approximately +2 to -4 GHz around the fine structure line of neutral atomic oxygen, OI, at 4.7448 THz. The LO has been successfully operated on SOFIA during six observation flights in May 2014 and January 2015.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "539", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "545", "date_publication": "Wed Jul 08 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15323635", "date": "July 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jul 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "539 - 545", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Heiko Richter", "Martin Wienold", "Lutz Schrottke", "Klaus Biermann", "Holger T.
