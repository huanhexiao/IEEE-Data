One-dimensional hydrodynamic equations coupled with a pseudo-two-dimensional Poisson equation are derived at first-order to obtain the small-signal admittance matrix describing the transistor. This matrix is then used to model the loaded device and establish its voltage amplification. The admittances and voltage amplification spectra exhibit sharp resonances associated with the plasma modes of the channel. The influences of the device geometry, operating temperature and connected load are investigated.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "584", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "589", "date_publication": "Tue Jun 09 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15323650", "date": "July 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jul 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "584 - 589", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Fatima Zohra Mahi", "Hugues Marinchio", "Christophe Palermo", "Luca Varani"], "keywords": ["Poisson equation", "field effect transistors", "hydrodynamics", "admittances", "analytical approach", "field-effect transistor channels", "nanometric field-effect transistor", "one-dimensional hydrodynamic equations", "plasma modes", "pseudo-two-dimensional Poisson equation", "small-signal admittance matrix", "terahertz frequencies", "terahertz small-signal response", "voltage amplification", "Admittance", "Logic gates", "Oscillators", "Plasma temperature", "Resonant frequency", "Transistors", "Nanometric field-effect transistor (FET)", "resonances", "small-signal admittance", "terahertz (THz)", ""], "arnumber": "7120200"}
