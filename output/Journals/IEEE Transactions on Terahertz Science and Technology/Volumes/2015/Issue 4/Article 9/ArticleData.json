The phase noise of the 192 GHz signal resulting from the beating of two optical comb lines is theoretically analyzed and experimentally examined. Moreover, a three channel, 10 Gbaud QPSK THz signal is generated, and transmission over 40 km standard single mode fiber (SSMF) is experimentally demonstrated.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "590", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "597", "date_publication": "Mon May 04 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15323632", "date": "July 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jul 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "590 - 597", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Tong Shao", "Haymen Shams", "Prince M.
