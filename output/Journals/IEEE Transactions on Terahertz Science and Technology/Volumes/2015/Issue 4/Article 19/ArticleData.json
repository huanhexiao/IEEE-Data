Although the proposed circuit model holds true, the surface admittance between the metallic hole array and the cover was erroneously calculated since the presence of the cross-polarization terms had been neglected. Furthermore, there have been mistakes in numerical simulation and in analytical calculations based on the presented formulas. The correct formulation is now given, and erroneous figures are replotted.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "655", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "656", "date_publication": "Tue Jun 09 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "date": "July 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jul 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "655 - 656", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Amin Khavasi", "Khashayar Mehrany", "Ghazaleh Kafaie Shirmanesh", "Elahe Yarmoghaddam"], "keywords": ["Admittance", "Diffraction", "Electrodes", "Integrated circuit modeling", "Numerical models", "Numerical simulation", "Surface waves", "Circuit model", "metamaterial", "transparent conductive electrodes", ""], "arnumber": "7120201"}
