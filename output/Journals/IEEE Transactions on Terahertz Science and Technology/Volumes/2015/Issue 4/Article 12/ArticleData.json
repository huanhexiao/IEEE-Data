A square patch antenna with a 170 \u03bcm-long side was fabricated on a 7 \u03bcm-thick benzocyclobutene (BCB) layer stacked on an RTD with a slot resonator. The RTD oscillated at ~ 510 GHz, and an output power of ~ 40 \u03bcW radiated in the upward direction without the Si lens. An equivalent circuit model was proposed to estimate the output power, and the circuit parameters were derived from the calculated admittance by electromagnetic simulation. The dependence of the output power on the side length of the patch antenna agreed with the theoretical calculation. Higher output power was expected with the optimization of BCB thickness and RTD with a high current density. The radiation pattern was measured, and a directivity of 7 dBi was obtained.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "613", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "618", "date_publication": "Tue Jun 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15323629", "date": "July 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jul 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "613 - 618", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Kengo Okada", "Kouhei Kasagi", "Naoto Oshima", "Safumi Suzuki", "Masahiro Asada"], "keywords": ["antenna radiation patterns", "current density", "equivalent circuits", "microstrip antennas", "resonant tunnelling diodes", "slot antennas", "submillimetre wave antennas", "submillimetre wave oscillators", "terahertz wave devices", "RTD", "admittance", "benzocyclobutene layer", "circuit parameters", "current density", "electromagnetic simulation", "equivalent circuit model", "output power", "power radiation", "radiation pattern", "resonant-tunneling-diode terahertz oscillator", "side length", "size 170 mum", "size 7 mum", "slot resonator", "slot-fed patch antennas", "square patch antenna", "Admittance", "Equivalent circuits", "Integrated circuit modeling", "Lenses", "Oscillators", "Patch antennas", "Power generation", "Patch antennas", "resonant tunneling devices", "submillimeter-wave integrated circuits", ""], "arnumber": "7124538"}
