It integrates auxiliary differential equation (ADE)-FDTD with high-order conformal FDTD (2, 4) so as to handle atomically thin periodic structures on an electrically anisotropic substrate with high flexibility and accuracy. The dispersion error and computational efficiency of the developed algorithm is validated in comparison with the piecewise linear recursive convolution (PLRC)-FDTD and commercial software HFSS, respectively. Numerical studies are further performed to demonstrate its capability for characterizing the effects of chemical potential of graphene, biasing electrostatic and magnetostatic fields, and geometrical parameters of different GFSSs on the central frequencies and 3-dB bandwidths of their passbands and stopbands. In particular, both frequency selectivity and tunability of GFSSs made of single- and double-layer periodic split-ring resonators are predicted, which can be exploited for developing some novel tunable THz structures.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "358", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "367", "date_publication": "Tue Mar 10 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15106901", "date": "May 2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Apr 29 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "358 - 367", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Yang Guo", "Tian Zhang", "Wen-Yan Yin", "Xiang-Hua Wang"], "keywords": ["chemical potential", "differential equations", "finite difference time-domain analysis", "frequency selective surfaces", "graphene", "graphene devices", "periodic structures", "resonators", "terahertz wave devices", "C", "atomically thin periodic structures", "auxiliary differential equation-FDTD", "biasing electrostatic field effect", "biasing magnetostatic field effect", "central frequencies", "computational efficiency", "dispersion error", "double-layer periodic split-ring resonator", "electrically anisotropic substrate", "frequency selectivity", "frequency tunability", "geometrical parameter effect", "graphene chemical potential effect", "high-order conformal FDTD", "improved hybrid finite-difference time-domain method", "passbands", "single-layer periodic split-ring resonator", "stopbands", "terahertz-wave applications", "transmission characteristics", "tunable dispersive graphene frequency-selective surfaces", "tunable terahertz structures", "Accuracy", "Conductivity", "Finite difference methods", "Graphene", "Magnetic anisotropy", "Magnetostatics", "Time-domain analysis", "Anisotropic", "auxiliary differential equation (ADE)-FDTD", "graphene frequency-selective surface (GFSS)", "high-order conformal FDTD (2, 4)", "split-ring resonator (SRR)", "subcell", "terahertz (THz) band", "transmission", "tunability", ""], "arnumber": "7057682"}
