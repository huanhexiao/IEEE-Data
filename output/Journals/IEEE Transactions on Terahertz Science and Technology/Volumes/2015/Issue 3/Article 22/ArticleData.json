These expressions show that at lower normalized frequencies when the grating is zeroth order and all off-specular diffraction orders are evanescent, metallic slit arrays with slanted and straight walls could become identical to each other whenever certain relation is held between the geometrical parameters of the two structures. A noteworthy advantage of juxtaposing slanted and slit arrays is that it shows slant angle in slanted structures is tantamount to decreasing the slit width and increasing the slit thickness in slit arrays with straight walls. This particular finding suggests that metamaterials with high index of refraction and smaller thickness can be realized by increasing the slant angle instead of decreasing the slit width.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "497", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "504", "date_publication": "Tue Apr 07 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15091960", "date": "May 2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Apr 29 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "497 - 504", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Masoud Edalatipour", "Khashayar Mehrany"], "keywords": ["diffraction gratings", "microwave metamaterials", "refractive index", "terahertz metamaterials", "analytical expressions", "diffraction orders", "geometrical parameters", "metallic gratings", "metallic slit arrays", "metamaterials", "microwave frequency", "nonprincipal eigenmodes", "normalized frequencies", "oblique slit arrays", "refraction index", "slant angle", "slanted slit array", "slit thickness", "slit width", "straight slit array", "straight walls", "terahertz frequencies", "zeroth-order diffraction efficiencies", "Diffraction", "Electromagnetics", "Geometry", "Gratings", "Metals", "Slabs", "High index metamaterials", "metallic slit arrays", "slanted gratings", "spoof surface plasmon polaritons", ""], "arnumber": "7081372"}
