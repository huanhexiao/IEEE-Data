Measured DSB noise temperature of 7900 K and conversion loss of 14 dB have been obtained. This configuration offers an alternative solution which simplifies the LO signal generation. It can find an application in imaging systems, where arrays of detectors need to be simultaneously fed by the same LO.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "518", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "520", "date_publication": "Mon Mar 09 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15091952", "date": "May 2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Apr 29 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "518 - 520", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Itziar Maestrojuan", "I\u00f1igo Ederra", "Ramon Gonzalo"], "keywords": ["Schottky diode mixers", "submillimetre wave mixers", "DSB noise temperature", "LO signal generation", "RF frequency", "conversion loss", "detector arrays", "fourth-harmonic Schottky diode mixer development", "frequency 440 GHz", "imaging systems", "submillimeter frequencies", "temperature 7900 K", "Frequency measurement", "Loss measurement", "Mixers", "Noise", "Radio frequency", "Schottky diodes", "Temperature measurement", "Conversion loss", "fourth harmonic mixer", "noise temperature", ""], "arnumber": "7056565"}
