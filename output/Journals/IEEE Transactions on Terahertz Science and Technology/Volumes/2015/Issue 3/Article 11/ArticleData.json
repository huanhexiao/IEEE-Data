By breaking the symmetry of a split ring resonator, two asymmetric resonances are excited from a dipole resonance, which enhance both the absorption and Q-factor. With the integration of four different ASRs into one unit cell, a broadband absorber experimentally obtained a 0.82-THz bandwidth with absorptivity of more than 0.9, which is 3.4 times as wide as the 0.24-THz bandwidth of the symmetric dipole peak. The proposed broadband absorber has great application potentials in the THz spectroscopy, imaging, and sensing.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "406", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "411", "date_publication": "Wed Feb 25 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15091948", "date": "May 2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Apr 29 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "406 - 411", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Yongzheng Wen", "Wei Ma", "Joe Bailey", "Guy Matmon", "Xiaomei Yu"], "keywords": ["Q-factor", "resonators", "terahertz metamaterials", "Q-factor", "asymmetric resonances", "asymmetric split ring resonator", "broadband terahertz metamaterial absorber", "dipole resonance", "frequency 0.24 THz", "frequency 0.82 THz", "perfect absorption", "symmetric dipole peak bandwidth", "terahertz imaging", "terahertz sensing", "terahertz spectroscopy", "Absorption", "Bandwidth", "Broadband communication", "Gold", "Impedance", "Metamaterials", "Resonant frequency", "Asymmetry", "broadband", "metamaterials", "perfect absorption", "terahertz", ""], "arnumber": "7048059"}
