Terahertz (THz) time-domain spectroscopy was used to measure the polarization dependence of the transmittance of the CNTA sheets from 0.5-2.2 THz. CNTA sheets with thicknesses of 40 \u03bcm and 150 \u03bcm showed high extinction ratios at 1 THz of 25 dB and dB, respectively. Furthermore, the transmittance of the 40 \u03bcm CNTA sheet for THz polarization parallel to the carbon nanotubes decreased with increasing frequency, resulting in an extinction ratio of 34 dB at 2 THz exceeding that of a commercial wire-grid polarizer. The potential of laser-cut free-standing CNTA sheets as terahertz polarizers is discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "377", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "382", "date_publication": "Fri Feb 06 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15091959", "date": "May 2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Apr 29 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "377 - 382", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Zhenyou Wang", "Fengping Hu", "Weixing Chen", "Frank A.
