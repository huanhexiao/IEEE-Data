The capacitance of the SIS mixer determines both the RF and IF performance. Previously, measurements of this capacitance has had high uncertainty. Herein, we determine the SIS junction capacitance at cryogenic temperature ( ~ 4 K) by direct measurement of the SIS junction impedance at microwave frequencies. The proposed calibration method uses only one short-circuit reference. The SIS junction capacitance measurement is realized by biasing the junction at the different parts of its current-voltage characteristic, thus eliminating a separate measurement of short-circuit standard. In order to verify the measurement results, thin-film capacitors with known capacitance were also measured. The capacitance of four SIS junctions with various areas were measured. The absolute uncertainty of the proposed measurement method was found to vary from 5 to 6.8% amongst different junction areas.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "464", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "469", "date_publication": "Thu Mar 26 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15091954", "date": "May 2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Apr 29 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "464 - 469", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Parisa Yadranjee Aghdam", "Hawal Rashid", "Alexey Pavolotsky", "Vincent Desmaris", "Denis Meledin", "Victor Belitsky"], "keywords": ["capacitance", "capacitance measurement", "superconductor-insulator-superconductor mixers", "thin film capacitors", "IF performance", "RF performance", "calibration method", "cryogenic temperature", "current-voltage characteristic", "environmental science", "junction areas", "junction impedance", "microwave frequencies", "radioastronomy", "submillimeter mixer", "superconducting tunnel junction capacitance measurement", "superconductor-insulator-superconductor junction", "thin-film capacitors", "Calibration", "Capacitance", "Capacitance measurement", "Junctions", "Measurement uncertainty", "Temperature measurement", "Transmission line measurements", "Capacitance measurement", "microwave measurement", "submillimeter-wave devices", "superconducting microwave devices", "tunnel junctions", ""], "arnumber": "7069183"}
