MKID is accomplished by making a strip of superconductor part of a microwave resonant circuit, and monitoring the phase and amplitude of a probe signal transmitted through the resonator. Frequency-domain multiplexing will allow up to thousands of resonators to be read out through a single line. We developed a 600-pixel 220 GHz detector array and a 102-pixel 440-GHz detector array. We have developed a new scheme readout system for the detector arrays, and which uses a frequency-sweeping probe signal instead of a fixed-frequency probe signal. This scheme enables us a direct measurement of the changed resonance frequency after optical loading.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "456", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "463", "date_publication": "Fri Apr 03 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15091951", "date": "May 2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Apr 29 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "456 - 463", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Hitoshi Kiuchi", "Takashi Okada", "Kenichi Karatsu", "Yutaro Sekimoto"], "keywords": ["radioastronomy", "readout electronics", "superconducting arrays", "superconducting microwave devices", "terahertz wave detectors", "frequency 220 GHz", "frequency 440 GHz", "frequency sweeping readout system", "frequency-domain multiplexing", "frequency-sweeping probe signal", "microwave kinetic inductance detector technology", "microwave resonant circuit", "optical loading", "probe signal amplitude", "probe signal phase", "resonance frequency measurement", "resonator", "submillimeter radio astronomy", "superconductive detector array", "superconductor strip", "terahertz astronomical observation", "Bandwidth", "Frequency measurement", "Frequency modulation", "Loading", "Optical resonators", "Probes", "Resonant frequency", "Digital signal processing (DSP)", "frequency modulation", "radio astronomy", "submillimeter-wave measurement", "superconducting device", ""], "arnumber": "7079501"}
