In order to accurately model the curved graphene boundaries, the conformal FDTD method is further hybridized with the HIE-FDTD method, which results in a conformal HIE-FDTD method. Numerical results are presented for S-parameters and field distributions of the coupler, which can be adjusted effectively by changing the chemical potential and layer number of graphene patch or substrate permittivity.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "368", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "376", "date_publication": "Fri Mar 20 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15091968", "date": "May 2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Apr 29 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "368 - 376", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Meng-Lin Zhai", "Hong-Li Peng", "Xiang-Hua Wang", "Xi Wang", "Zhizhang Chen", "Wen-Yan Yin"], "keywords": ["chemical potential", "differential equations", "finite difference time-domain analysis", "graphene", "graphene devices", "monolayers", "optical couplers", "permittivity", "terahertz wave devices", "C", "Drude model", "S-parameters", "auxiliary differential equation technique", "chemical potential", "conformal hybrid implicit-explicit finite-difference time-domain method", "curved graphene boundaries", "field distributions", "geometrical parameter", "graphene-based patch couplers", "layer number", "monolayer graphene", "physical parameter", "substrate permittivity", "terahertz applications", "tunable graphene-based couplers", "Couplers", "Finite difference methods", "Graphene", "Mathematical model", "Scattering parameters", "Stability analysis", "Time-domain analysis", "Conformal techniques", "S-parameters", "coupler", "graphene", "hybrid implicit-explicit finite-difference time-domain (HIE-FDTD)", "multilayer", ""], "arnumber": "7064801"}
