Use of nano-antennas and nano-plasmonic light concentrators in photoconductive terahertz sources and detectors has proven to offer significantly higher terahertz radiation powers and detection sensitivities by enhancing photoconductor quantum efficiency while maintaining its ultrafast operation. This is because of the unique capability of nano-antennas and nano-plasmonic structures in manipulating the concentration of photo-generated carriers within the device active area, allowing a larger number of photocarriers to efficiently contribute to terahertz radiation and detection. An overview of some of the recent advancements in terahertz optoelectronic devices through use of various types of nano-antennas and nano-plasmonic light concentrators is presented in this article.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "391", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "397", "date_publication": "Tue Mar 10 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15091965", "date": "May 2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Apr 29 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "391 - 397", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Mona Jarrahi"], "keywords": ["carrier density", "metamaterial antennas", "nanophotonics", "nanosensors", "nanostructured materials", "photoconducting devices", "photodetectors", "plasmonics", "terahertz wave detectors", "terahertz wave imaging", "detection sensitivities", "device active area", "high power sources", "high sensitivity detectors", "nanoantennas", "nanoplasmonic light concentrators", "photoconductive terahertz optoelectronics", "photoconductive terahertz sources", "photoconductor quantum efficiency", "photogenerated carrier concentration", "sensing systems", "terahertz imaging", "terahertz radiation powers", "ultrafast operation", "Electrodes", "Gratings", "Optical device fabrication", "Optical imaging", "Optical pumping", "Optical sensors", "Plasmons", "Nano-antennas", "nanostructures", "photoconductivity", "plasmonics", "terahertz detector", "terahertz source", ""], "arnumber": "7057689"}
