It has been observed that the path loss is not only the function of distance and frequency but also related to the dielectric loss of human tissues. Numerical results have been compared with analytical studies and a good match has been found which validates the proposed numerical model. Based on the calculation of path losses and noise level for THz wave propagation, the channel capacity is studied to give an insight of future nano-communications within the human body. Results show that at the distance of millimeters, the capacity can reach as high as 100 Terabits per second (Tbps) depending on the environment and exciting pulse types.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "419", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "426", "date_publication": "Wed Apr 15 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15091964", "date": "May 2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Apr 29 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "419 - 426", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Ke Yang", "Alice Pellegrini", "Max O.
