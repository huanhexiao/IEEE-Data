Using well-established models to characterize the electromagnetic parameters of electrically-doped graphene, we estimate the theoretical performance of the proposed structures, in particular the required switching voltage and the achievable modulation depth. These results predict considerably improved performance with respect to the state-of-the-art of graphene THz modulators, together with reduced size and larger THz bandwidth.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "351", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "357", "date_publication": "Mon Apr 13 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15091958", "date": "May 2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Apr 29 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "351 - 357", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Andrea Locatelli", "Graham E.
