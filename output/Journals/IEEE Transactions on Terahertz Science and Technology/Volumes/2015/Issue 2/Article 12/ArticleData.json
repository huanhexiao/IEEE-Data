To correlate the THz emission with the photo-excited charge density distribution and the photo-current direction, we mapped near-field and far-field distributions of the generated THz waves from GaAs and Fe-doped InGaAs surfaces. The experimental results show that the charge dynamics in the plane of the surface can radiate substantially stronger THz pulses than the charge dynamics in the direction normal to the surface, which is generally regarded as the dominant origin of the emission.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "260", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "267", "date_publication": "Tue Feb 10 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14965241", "date": "March 2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 03 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "2", "pages": "260 - 267", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Raimund Mueckstein", "Michele Natrella", "Osama Hatem", "Joshua R.
