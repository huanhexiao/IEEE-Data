In order to realize the additional advantages of broadband tuning and high efficiency interaction, this paper is devoted to exploring the THz pre-bunched ECM. Other than a conventional open-cavity tunable gyrotron consecutively switching between axial modes to realize frequency tuning, a pre-bunched ECM system operates on the backward traveling-wave resonance to achieve broadband smooth tuning. Especially, an interaction circuit of specified axial profile of beam-wave detuning frequency is built to achieve high efficiency. An optimized 0.1 THz pre-bunched ECM system using an electron beam of 30 kV voltage and 3 A current is predicted to generate broad bandwidth of 10 GHz and efficiency between 10% ~ 25%. The broadband tuning pre-bunched ECM is promising for a new generation of broadband and high-power THz source.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "236", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "243", "date_publication": "Fri Dec 12 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14980222", "date": "March 2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 03 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "2", "pages": "236 - 243", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Chao-Hai Du", "Xiang-Bo Qi", "Ling-Bao Kong", "Pu-Kun Liu", "Zheng-Di Li", "Shou-Xi Xu", "Zhi-Hui Geng", "Liu Xiao"], "keywords": ["backward wave tubes", "cyclotron masers", "relativistic electron beam tubes", "relativistic electron beams", "terahertz wave generation", "THz prebunched ECM", "axial modes", "backward traveling-wave resonance", "beam-wave detuning frequency", "broadband tunable prebunched electron cyclotron maser", "conventional open-cavity tunable gyrotron", "current 3 A", "electron beam", "frequency 0.1 THz", "frequency 10 GHz", "frequency tuning", "high-power THz source", "high-power THz wave generation", "interaction circuit", "relativistic electron cyclotron maser", "terahertz application", "voltage 30 kV", "Broadband communication", "Cavity resonators", "Cyclotrons", "Electron beams", "Electronic countermeasures", "Gyrotrons", "Tuning", "Broadband tuning", "coherent radiation", "electron cyclotron maser (ECM)", "terahertz (THz)", ""], "arnumber": "6983638"}
