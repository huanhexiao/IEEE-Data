Three PAs were designed: PA1 was implemented with two-stage cascode HBTs, PA2 combined two PA1s, and PA3 combined four PA1s, by using Wilkinson couplers without isolation resistors. Electromagnetic simulations were carried out for the accurate design of passive circuits such as a microstrip line, a capacitor, and RF pads. The measured insertion loss of the RF pad and Wilkinson coupler was as low as 0.24 dB and 0.70 dB, respectively, at 300 GHz. The three PAs exhibited a measured gain higher than 15 dB with good return losses at 300 GHz. The output powers scaled well with total emitter area of the PAs. PA3 exhibited a maximum output power of 13.5 dBm at 301 GHz. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this corresponds to the highest output power among the previously reported solid-state PAs in this frequency range.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "215", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "222", "date_publication": "Fri Jan 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14965234", "date": "March 2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 03 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "2", "pages": "215 - 222", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Jungsik Kim", "Sanggeun Jeon", "Moonil Kim", "Miguel Urteaga", "Jinho Jeong"], "keywords": ["III-V semiconductors", "capacitors", "heterojunction bipolar transistors", "indium compounds", "microstrip lines", "microwave integrated circuits", "microwave power amplifiers", "passive networks", "H-band power amplifier integrated circuits", "HBT technology", "InP", "RF pads", "Wilkinson couplers", "capacitor", "cascode topology", "electromagnetic simulations", "frequency 220 GHz to 325 GHz", "insertion loss", "microstrip line", "output powers", "passive circuit design", "return losses", "size 250 nm", "total emitter area", "Couplers", "Gain", "Heterojunction bipolar transistors", "Indium phosphide", "Loss measurement", "Power generation", "Radio frequency", "InP HBT", "Wilkinson coupler", "power amplifier", "submillimeter-wave", "terahertz", ""], "arnumber": "7019001"}
