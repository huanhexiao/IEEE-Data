Negative refraction, which arises from the negative refractive angle, can occur when a p-polarized wave is incident from a dielectric to a superconductor. The dependences of negative refractive angle on the angle of incidence, the wave frequency, and the temperature have been analytically studied. The conditions for obtaining a pronounced result in negative refraction are elucidated. The study of negative refraction is of potential use in designing a tunable polarizer. In addition, it is an extended study of a transmission problem that is not treatable from the Fresnel equations in electromagnetics and optics.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "230", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "235", "date_publication": "Tue Jan 13 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14965242", "date": "March 2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 03 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "2", "pages": "230 - 235", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Meng-Ru Wu", "Heng-Tung Hsu", "Chien-Jang Wu", "Shoou-Jinn Chang"], "keywords": ["high-temperature superconductors", "metamaterials", "terahertz waves", "Fresnel equations", "high-temperature superconducting material", "incidence angle", "inhomogeneous wave theory", "negative refractive angle", "p-polarized wave", "terahertz frequency", "terahertz negative refraction", "transmission problem", "tunable polarizer", "wave frequency", "Art", "High-temperature superconductors", "Metals", "Permittivity", "Photonic crystals", "Vectors", "Negative refraction", "polarized wave", "superconductor", "two-fluid model", ""], "arnumber": "7008526"}
