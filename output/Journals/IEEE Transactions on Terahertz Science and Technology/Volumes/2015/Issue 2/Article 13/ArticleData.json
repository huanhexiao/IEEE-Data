In the proposed technology, all mmW passive components are made of high-resistivity Silicon (Si) on a glass substrate. The proposed technique leads to a high-precision and low-cost fabrication process, which eliminates the need for costly assembly of the complex structures. This is achieved by photolithography and dry etching of the entire integrated passive circuit through the Si layer of the SOG wafer. Silicon-on-Glass dielectric waveguide, as the basic component of the SOG integrated circuit, is theoretically and experimentally investigated. A test setup is designed to measure propagation characteristics of the proposed SOG waveguide. Measured dispersion diagrams of the SOG dielectric waveguide show average attenuation constants of 0.63 dB/cm, 0.28 dB/cm, and 0.53 dB/cm over 55-65 GHz, 90-110 GHz, and 140-170 GHz, respectively.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "268", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "279", "date_publication": "Mon Feb 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14980223", "date": "March 2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 03 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "2", "pages": "268 - 279", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Nazy Ranjkesh", "Mohamed Basha", "Aidin Taeb", "Alireza Zandieh", "Suren Gigoyan", "Safieddin Safavi-Naeini"], "keywords": ["dielectric waveguides", "etching", "millimetre wave integrated circuits", "photolithography", "silicon-on-insulator", "SOG integrated circuit technology", "SOG wafer", "dispersion diagrams", "dry etching", "frequency 140 GHz to 170 GHz", "frequency 55 GHz to 65 GHz", "frequency 90 GHz to 110 GHz", "high precision fabrication process", "low cost fabrication process", "millimeter wave integrated circuits", "mmW passive components", "photolithography", "silicon-on-glass dielectric waveguide", "Attenuation", "Dielectrics", "Fabrication", "Glass", "Optical waveguides", "Silicon", "Substrates", "Millimeter-wave (mmW) integrated circuit", "Silicon-on-Glass (SOG) waveguide", "mmW waveguide", ""], "arnumber": "7047240"}
