Three candidate corneal tissue water content (CTWC) perturbations, based on corneal physiology, are investigated that affect the axial water distribution and total thickness. The THz frequency reflectivity properties of the three CTWC perturbations were simulated and explored with varying system center frequency and bandwidths (Q-factors). The modeling showed that at effective optical path lengths on the order of a wavelength the cornea presents a lossy etalon bordered by air at the anterior and the aqueous humor at the posterior. The simulated standing wave peak-to-valley ratio is pronounced at lower frequencies and its effect on acquired data can be modulated by adjusting the bandwidth of the sensing system. These observations are supported with experimental spectroscopic data. The results suggest that a priori knowledge of corneal thickness can be utilized for accurate assessments of corneal tissue water content. The physiologic variation of corneal thickness with respect to the wavelengths spanned by the THz band is extremely limited compared to all other structures in the body making CTWC sensing unique amongst all proposed applications of THz medical imaging.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "170", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "183", "date_publication": "Wed Feb 18 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "14965240", "date": "March 2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 03 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "2", "pages": "170 - 183", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Zachary D.
