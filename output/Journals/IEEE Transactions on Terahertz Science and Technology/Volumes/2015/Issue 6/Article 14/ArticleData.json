Results are presented which show that the terahertz optical properties of cyclododecane are dependent on the rate at which it has cooled from the melt. Based on the results, a theoretical explanation of the contrast enhancement mechanism is postulated. The findings presented here may lead to the development of novel coating materials that could improve the quality of terahertz images in a variety of fields and not just in art conservation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1005", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "1011", "date_publication": "Fri Sep 25 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15615665", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "1005 - 1011", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["John W.
