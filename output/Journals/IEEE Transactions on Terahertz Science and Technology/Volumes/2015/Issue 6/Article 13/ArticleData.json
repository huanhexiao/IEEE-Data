Inevitably, useful devices have to provide an adequate compromise between spatial resolution limited due to diffraction and penetration through clothing. Within this context, the spectral absorption of a wide range of fabric, interference caused by the texture, and the effect of moisture within the fabric have to be considered. We have studied these effects by time-domain and Fourier transformation spectroscopy. The experimental findings are verified using a passive THz security camera operating in two frequency bands at 0.85 and 0.35 THz. The latter band was proven to be of superior use for security checks as it provides useful results even in cases of wet clothes.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "999", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "1004", "date_publication": "Tue Sep 22 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15615656", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "999 - 1004", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Richard Knipper", "Anika Brahm", "Erik Heinz", "Torsten May", "Gunther Notni", "Hans-Georg Meyer", "Andreas T\u00fcnnermann", "J\u00fcrgen Popp"], "keywords": ["biological effects of microwaves", "clothing", "electromagnetic wave absorption", "fabrics", "hazardous materials", "national security", "optical scanners", "terahertz spectroscopy", "terahertz wave imaging", "terrorism", "Fourier transformation spectroscopy", "THz absorption", "THz security camera", "body scanner technology", "body scanning", "clothing", "fabrics", "frequency 0.35 THz", "frequency 0.85 THz", "hazardous object detection", "millimeter wave technology", "moisture effect", "spatial resolution", "spectral absorption", "terahertz technology", "terrorist attack", "time-domain spectroscopy", "Absorption", "Atmospheric measurements", "Cameras", "Fabrics", "Physics", "Security", "Imaging and spectroscoscopy", "imaging arrays", "material properties", ""], "arnumber": "7274073"}
