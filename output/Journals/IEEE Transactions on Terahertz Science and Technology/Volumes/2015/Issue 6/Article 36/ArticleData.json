In the optical communications field, optical sampling technology is used to measure optical time division multiplexing, high-speed sweeping technology in terahertz wave spectroscopic devices, high throughput measurement, and other ultra-high-speed optical signals. In this study, we introduce terahertz wave analysis systems that utilize the terahertz optical sampling method. Furthermore, we provide measurement examples and describe industrial applications for terahertz waves.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1160", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "1165", "date_publication": "Nov. 2015", "inspec": "15602832", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "1160 - 1165", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society"}, "authors": ["Shigeki Nishina"], "keywords": ["nondestructive testing", "optical communication", "optical information processing", "signal sampling", "terahertz spectroscopy", "time division multiplexing", "time-domain analysis", "high throughput measurement", "high-speed sweeping technology", "high-throughput terahertz time-domain spectroscopy", "nondestructive examinations", "optical communication field", "optical sampling technology", "optical time division multiplexing", "terahertz optical sampling method", "terahertz wave analysis systems", "terahertz wave spectroscopic devices", "ultrahigh-speed optical signals", "High-speed optical techniques", "Optical imaging", "Optical pulses", "Optical variables measurement", "Sampling methods", "Throughput", "Time measurement", "Optical sampling and high speed sweeping", "terahertz", "time-domain spectroscopy (TDS)", ""], "arnumber": "7335436"}
