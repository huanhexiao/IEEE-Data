Novel THz-wave applications and interesting discoveries have been reported along with development of unique THz-wave measurement methods. This review presents aspects of the recent development of intense THz-wave sources. Particularly, a tunable THz-wave source and a method of attaining high output power are reported along with evidence of their performance. Future prospects of high-power THz-wave applications are described.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1104", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "1109", "date_publication": "Nov. 2015", "inspec": "15615650", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "1104 - 1109", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society"}, "authors": ["Hiroaki Minamide"], "keywords": ["terahertz wave detectors", "high-power terahertz-wave sources", "output power", "review", "tunable THz-wave source", "Crystals", "Laser beams", "Nonlinear optics", "Optical pulses", "Optical pumping", "Optical wavelength conversion", "High-power THz-wave source", "THz-wave nonlinear response", "non-destructive inspection", "nonlinear optical wavelength-conversion", "real-time THz-wave imaging", ""], "arnumber": "7334625"}
