Due to the consistency of energy regions, it is expected to bring about the non-labeling detection of hydrogen bonding and/or intermolecular recognition, as well as antibody responses, etc. Regularly arranged metallic mesh can also be used to make effective use of the THz wave anomalous propagation and absorption characteristics (spoof surface plasmon) of specimens for biopolymer systems, which do not indicate characteristic absorption in the THz band. This paper introduces the THz wave absorption and propagation characteristics in metallic meshes designed for the THz sensing and for application to biomedical related specimens.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1146", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "1153", "date_publication": "Nov. 2015", "inspec": "15615649", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "1146 - 1153", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society"}, "authors": ["Hitoshi Tabata"], "keywords": ["biomedical measurement", "hydrogen bonds", "polymers", "terahertz wave detectors", "antibody response", "biomedical field", "biopolymer system", "hydrogen bonding detection", "intermolecular recognition", "metal mesh resonant filter", "sensing technology", "terahertz propagation characteristics", "terahertz sensing", "terahertz wave absorption", "terahertz wave technology application", "Bonding", "DNA", "Hydrogen", "Metals", "Plasmons", "Proteins", "Surface waves", "THz wave surface Plasmon", "Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy", "biosensors", "label-free detection", "metal mesh filters", ""], "arnumber": "7335437"}
