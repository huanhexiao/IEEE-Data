This drop in power can be due to the increase in losses and manufacturing defects in their delay lines. In this study, we present measurement methods and setups developed for the characterization of delay-line performance. The developed methods were validated on two scaled-down models of a TH4229 carcinotron operating in frequency bandwidths around 10 and 100 GHz. Measurements of losses and dispersion diagrams were made using two different wave couplings with propagating waveguides and radiating horn antennas. Electromagnetic simulations were performed using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) code. For both delay lines, the results obtained from measurements with different couplings presented a very good level of consistency with simulations. The measured losses, normalized per delay line elementary cell, were 0.04 and 0.12 dB/cell at 9.5 and 95 GHz, respectively. Accordingly, the normalized ohmic losses were extrapolated at THz frequencies and at 0.95 THz, 0.38 dB/cell was obtained. As a first approximation, only the skin-effect ohmic losses were considered. The ability to characterize delay lines using radiating coupling was demonstrated.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1053", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "1061", "date_publication": "Fri Oct 09 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15634192", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "1053 - 1061", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Remy Villeneuve", "Maryl\u00e8ne Cueille", "Delia Arnaud-Cormos", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois David", "Philippe Leveque", "Alain-Joseph Durand"], "keywords": ["backward wave oscillators", "carcinotrons", "delay lines", "finite difference time-domain analysis", "loss measurement", "microwave measurement", "microwave tubes", "millimetre wave measurement", "millimetre wave tubes", "skin effect", "terahertz wave devices", "FDTD code", "TH4229 carcinotron", "backward wave oscillator delay line", "centimeter-wave range", "dispersion diagram", "electromagnetic simulation", "finite-difference time-domain code", "frequency 0.95 THz", "frequency 9.5 GHz", "frequency 95 GHz", "frequency bandwidth", "horn antenna", "millimeter-wave range", "propagating waveguide", "radiating coupling", "skin-effect ohmic loss", "wave coupling", "Antenna measurements", "Blades", "Couplings", "Delay lines", "Electron tubes", "Horn antennas", "Loss measurement", "Backward-wave oscillator (BWO)", "carcinotron", "delay lines dispersion and losses", "measurements methods", "microwaves", "millimeter and submillimeter waves", ""], "arnumber": "7295631"}
