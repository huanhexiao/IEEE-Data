To achieve the goal, sensitive observations in the Terahertz range are essential since significant fraction of the the total energy is emitted in the range. However, the atmosphere of the earth is opaque mostly in the range, and space telescopes are required for sensitive observations. We discuss examples of the Terahertz observations of the universe using space telescopes, focusing on Japan-related infrared astronomical satellites AKARI (launched in 2006) and SPICA (expected to be launched in the 2020s).", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1133", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "1139", "date_publication": "Nov. 2015", "inspec": "15602831", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "1133 - 1139", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society"}, "authors": ["Takao Nakagawa"], "keywords": ["cosmology", "terahertz waves", "Japan-related infrared astronomical satellite AKARI data", "Japan-related infrared astronomical satellite SPICA data", "Terahertz range observations", "Universe evolution", "astrophysics research", "earth atmosphere", "space telescope data", "Aerospace electronics", "Earth", "Satellites", "Space missions", "Telescopes", "Terrestrial atmosphere", "Astronomy", "satellites", "terahertz", ""], "arnumber": "7335440"}
