In recent years, progress in semiconductor integrated circuits has enabled indoor transmission experiments of 100-Gb/s-grade terahertz wireless links and outdoor transmission experiment over distances of more than 1 km. In this paper, trends in the research and development of the domestic and foreign terahertz wireless communications technology and the standardization are presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1128", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "1132", "date_publication": "Nov. 2015", "inspec": "15602833", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "1128 - 1132", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society"}, "authors": ["Akihiko Hirata", "Makoto Yaita"], "keywords": ["indoor radio", "monolithic integrated circuits", "radio links", "standardisation", "indoor transmission experiment", "outdoor transmission experiment", "semiconductor integrated circuit", "terahertz wireless link", "ultrafast terahertz wireless communications technology", "Antenna arrays", "Data communication", "Power generation", "Research and development", "Slot antennas", "Wireless communication", "Wireless sensor networks", "Antenna", "MMIC", "broadband wireless communications", "terahertz", ""], "arnumber": "7335434"}
