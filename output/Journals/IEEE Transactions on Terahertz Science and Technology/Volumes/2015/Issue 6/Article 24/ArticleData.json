In this paper we present a millimeter-wave monolithic integrated circuit (MMIC)-based transmit and receive front-end and ultra-broadband wireless data transmission experiments utilizing a 240 GHz carrier frequency in a long-range outdoor scenario as well as measurements inside a climatic wind tunnel. Data rates up to 64 Gb/s and various complex modulation formats are employed. While in the outdoor transmission, the link is tested in terms of maximum achievable transmission distance and data rate as well as alignment accuracy, in the climatic wind tunnel the influence of rain and fog in the transmission path is investigated in a defined and controlled environment.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1078", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "1087", "date_publication": "Wed Nov 04 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15615669", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "1078 - 1087", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Jochen Antes", "Florian Boes", "Tobias Messinger", "Ulrich J.
