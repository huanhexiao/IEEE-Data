We report on autocorrelation measurements at 3.41 THz of high-power THz pulses for determination of the pulse duration and pulse structure. By fringe-resolved measurements, the THz frequency of the pulse is also obtained. We develop a theoretical model for the rectification process and compare the performance of an antenna-coupled Schottky diode to a large-area field-effect transistor rectifier. While the Schottky diode saturates earlier and can therefore be used for autocorrelation measurements at lower input power, antenna-less large-area field-effect transistors can be used for highest power levels-even at free electron lasers-and turn out to be very robust.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "922", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "929", "date_publication": "Wed Oct 14 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15615657", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "922 - 929", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Sascha Preu", "Martin Mittendorff", "Stephan Winnerl", "Oleg Cojocari", "Andreas Penirschke"], "keywords": ["Schottky diodes", "correlators", "field effect transistors", "pulse circuits", "rectifiers", "terahertz wave devices", "THz autocorrelator", "antenna-coupled Schottky diode", "electron laser", "frequency 3.41 THz", "fringe-resolved measurement", "high-power THz pulse", "ps pulse characterization", "pulse duration", "pulse structure", "rectifying field-effect transistor", "sublinear response", "terahertz frequency", "Antenna measurements", "Correlation", "Detectors", "Frequency measurement", "Pulse measurements", "Schottky diodes", "Shape", "Autocorrelation", "Schottky diode", "field-effect transistor", "free electron laser", "terahertz (THz)", ""], "arnumber": "7298456"}
