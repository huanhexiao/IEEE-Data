Both the HEBM and the THz-QCL device are fabricated in our laboratory. NbN film with 3 nm thickness was deposited on MgO substrate. The output power of the metal-metal waveguide type 3.1 THz-QCL was about 100 W at a heat sink temperature of 15 K. The lowest uncorrected receiver noise temperature of the HEBM was 1200 K (DSB). The corrected receiver noise temperature was 810 K (DSB). The measured IF noise bandwidth was about 3 GHz. The spectroscopic Allan time was 10 s. We have also demonstrated detection of emission line spectra of methanol [CH 3OH ].", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1154", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "1159", "date_publication": "Nov. 2015", "inspec": "15615653", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "1154 - 1159", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society"}, "authors": ["Yoshihisa Irimajiri", "Akira Kawakami", "Isao Morohashi", "Motohiro Kumagai", "Norihiko Sekine", "Shigeo Nagano", "Satoshi Ochiai", "Shukichi Tanaka", "Yuko Hanado", "Yoshinori Uzawa", "Iwao Hosako"], "keywords": ["bolometers", "electron waveguides", "hot carriers", "niobium compounds", "quantum cascade lasers", "submillimetre wave lasers", "submillimetre wave mixers", "submillimetre wave oscillators", "superconducting mixers", "temperature measurement", "temperature sensors", "thin film sensors", "DSB", "HEBM", "MgO", "NbN", "THz-QCL device", "emission line spectra detection", "frequency 3.1 THz", "heat sink", "local oscillator", "metal-metal waveguide type", "methanol detection", "size 3 nm", "spectroscopic Allan time", "superconducting low-noise hot electron bolometer receiver", "temperature 1200 K", "temperature 15 K", "temperature 810 K", "terahertz quantum cascade laser", "time 10 s", "Current measurement", "Measurement by laser beam", "Power generation", "Power measurement", "Quantum cascade lasers", "Receivers", "Temperature measurement", "Atmospheric and astronomical observations", "THz quantum cascade laser (QCL)", "hot electron bolometer (HEB) mixer", ""], "arnumber": "7335438"}
