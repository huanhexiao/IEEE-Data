Seraphinite is a particular form of clinochlore minerals in the chlorite group, and the THz frequency response of any chlorite minerals has been unknown. Here, we show, based on our THz time-domain spectroscopic measurements, that there are three absorption modes at 0.8, 0.96, and 1.2 THz , respectively. The 0.96 THz mode is, in particular, strong and narrow (Q=8), comparable to the previously reported 0.53 THz mode in \u03b1-lactose monohydrate. Also, a polarization-dependent study reveals the Au(z')-symmetry of the 0.8 and 1.2 THz modes and the Bu(x',y')-symmetry of the 0.96 THz mode. The anisotropy of the phonon-polariton dispersions shows an excellent agreement with theoretical analysis based on Kurosawa formula.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1021", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "1027", "date_publication": "Thu Sep 24 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15615660", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "1021 - 1027", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Daehoon Han", "Heejae Jeong", "Yunheung Song", "Jai Seok Ahn", "Jaewook Ahn"], "keywords": ["minerals", "phonons", "polaritons", "terahertz wave spectra", "time-domain analysis", "&#x03B1", "-lactose monohydrate", "Au(z')-symmetry", "Bu(x',y')-symmetry", "Kurosawa formula", "THz frequency", "THz time-domain spectroscopic measurements", "chlorite group", "chlorite minerals", "clinochlore minerals", "lattice vibrations", "naturally occurring seraphinite gemstones", "phonon-polariton dispersions", "polarization-dependent study", "terahertz frequency lattice vibrations", "terahertz time-domain spectroscopy", "Absorption", "Crystals", "Dielectric measurement", "Dielectrics", "Frequency measurement", "Refractive index", "Time-domain analysis", "Lattice vibration", "seraphinite", "spectroscopy", "terahertz absorption", ""], "arnumber": "7275077"}
