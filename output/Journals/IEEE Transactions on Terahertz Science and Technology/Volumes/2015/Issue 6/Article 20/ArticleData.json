The designs of electrodynamic and electro-optical systems are discussed for the frequency tripler with an output frequency of 260 GHz. The simulations of electron-wave interaction take into account the electron velocity spread, beam interception by a slow-wave structure, and the space charge effects. According to simulations, a two-cavity frequency tripler fed by a 1 W input signal at 86.67 GHz can deliver a maximum output power of about 15 W at a frequency of 260 GHz with a 90 MHz bandwidth (FWHM). Such a device is aimed to pulsed methods of the dynamic nuclear polarization in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1048", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "1052", "date_publication": "Wed Sep 02 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15615677", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "1048 - 1052", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Petr Makhalov", "Alexey Fedotov"], "keywords": ["electro-optical devices", "electrodynamics", "frequency multipliers", "klystrons", "magnetic resonance spectroscopy", "millimetre wave devices", "nuclear polarisation", "slow wave structures", "space charge", "terahertz wave devices", "FWHM", "bandwidth 90 MHz", "beam interception", "dynamic nuclear polarization", "electrodynamic system", "electron velocity spread", "electron-wave interaction", "electrooptical system", "extended interaction klystron frequency multiplier", "frequency 260 GHz", "frequency 86.67 GHz", "hollow electron beam", "nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy", "power 1 W", "pulsed method", "slow wave structure", "space charge effect", "subterahertz radiation", "two cavity frequency tripler", "Bandwidth", "Cavity resonators", "Couplings", "Electron beams", "Harmonic analysis", "Periodic structures", "Power generation", "Electron&#x2013", "wave interaction", "frequency multiplication", "hollow electron beam", "millimeter-wave source", "slow-wave structure", ""], "arnumber": "7236935"}
