By taking the cross-range range coupling term into account, which is usually neglected in some fast algorithm, such as the enhanced phase shift migration (EPSM), the focusing depth for image reconstruction is greatly improved in the proposed fast algorithm. To deal with the cross-range range coupling term, a wavenumber scaling operator (WSO) was developed in the proposed algorithm which only uses chirp multiplications and FFTs with high computation efficiency and free of interpolation. Theoretical analysis on the relationship of the WSO parameters to the resulted maximum non-ambiguous range in holography image reconstruction was carried out with a quantitative criterion derived to appropriately determine the WSO parameters. Simulation results validate the proposed focusing algorithm and indicate that 3D WSA offers almost the same focusing capabilities as the most rigid phase shift migration (PSM) algorithm, meanwhile with computation efficiency greatly improved. Proof-of-principle experiments in 0.2 THz band were also performed based on a monostatic prototype imager. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the 3D WSA proposed in this paper.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "967", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "977", "date_publication": "Mon Oct 26 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15615663", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "967 - 977", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Wei Liu", "Chao Li", "Zhaoyang Sun", "Qunying Zhang", "Guangyou Fang"], "keywords": ["Gaussian processes", "computational complexity", "fast Fourier transforms", "holography", "image reconstruction", "submillimetre wave imaging", "terahertz wave imaging", "3D WSA", "FFT", "PSM algorithm", "WSO parameters", "chirp multiplication", "fast three-dimensional image reconstruction", "focusing algorithm", "frequency 0.2 THz", "high computation efficiency", "maximum nonambiguous range", "phase shift migration", "proof-of-principle experiment", "terahertz Gaussian beam", "wavenumber scaling algorithm", "wideband terahertz holographic image reconstruct", "Chirp", "Couplings", "Focusing", "Holography", "Image reconstruction", "Wideband", "Gaussian beam", "THz imaging", "three-dimensional (3-D) holography", ""], "arnumber": "7303981"}
