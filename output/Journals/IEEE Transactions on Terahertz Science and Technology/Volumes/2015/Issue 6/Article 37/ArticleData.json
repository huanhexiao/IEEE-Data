Recent innovation in THz technology has brought a wide variety of applications through advances in detection and emission techniques in the THz range. In order to use THz technology safely, the importance of quality control for measurements in the THz range is increasing in terms of regulation for electromagnetic compatibility or non-ionizing radiation protection of humans. Because of this, measurement standards for the accuracy control of THz measurement have been aggressively developed in leading national metrology institutes. We provide an overview of the current status of THz measurement standards.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1166", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "1172", "date_publication": "Nov. 2015", "inspec": "15615651", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "1166 - 1172", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society"}, "authors": ["Yozo Shimada", "Hitoshi Iida", "Moto Kinoshita"], "keywords": ["measurement standards", "terahertz wave detectors", "electromagnetic compatibility", "humans", "nonionizing radiation protection", "quality control", "terahertz measurement standards", "Calibration", "Frequency measurement", "Measurement standards", "Power measurement", "Temperature measurement", "Temperature sensors", "Calorimeter", "measurement standards", "metrological traceability", "power measurement", "terahertz", ""], "arnumber": "7335435"}
