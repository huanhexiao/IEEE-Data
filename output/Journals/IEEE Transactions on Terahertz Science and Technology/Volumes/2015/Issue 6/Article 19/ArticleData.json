The filter is cascaded by two elliptic cavities which are operating at quasi- TM110 mode. Each elliptic cavity can introduce a transmission zero near the passband of the filter. By adjusting the axial-ratio (AR) of the elliptic cavity, the position of the introduced transmission zero could be moved to the upper side or the lower side of the passband. The micromachining process of deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) is used for the fabrication. The measured 3-dB bandwidth of the filter is 7.52%, from 380.2 to 409.9 GHz, and the measured insertion loss is 2.84 dB, including extra waveguide of about 4.5 mm at the input and output ports. In addition, the insertion loss of straight waveguide is also measured and analyzed. Then, an analysis method for the loss property is summarized. According to the measurement, the unit length loss of the waveguide is about 0.144 dB/mm at 400 GHz.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1040", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "1047", "date_publication": "Fri Oct 09 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15634191", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "1040 - 1047", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Jian-xing Zhuang", "Zhang-Cheng Hao", "Wei Hong"], "keywords": ["band-pass filters", "cavity resonator filters", "microcavities", "microfabrication", "sputter etching", "submillimetre wave filters", "terahertz wave devices", "waveguide filters", "AR", "DRIE", "axial-ratio", "deep reactive ion etching", "elliptic cavity", "frequency 380.2 GHz to 409.9 GHz", "micromachining process", "silicon micromachined elliptic cavity waveguide filter", "silicon micromachined terahertz bandpass filter", "Cavity resonators", "Etching", "Filtering theory", "Insertion loss", "Loss measurement", "Silicon", "Surface waves", "Bandpass filter", "deep reactive ion etching (DRIE)", "elliptic cavity", "insertion loss", "micromachining", "transmission zero", ""], "arnumber": "7295635"}
