Studies of thermal effects in humans caused by electromagnetic (EM) exposure with frequencies in the THz frequency range can rarely be found in the literature. In this paper, a method for the numerical computation of a potential thermal response in human skin due to EM fields between 0.1 and 10 THz is introduced. The method starts with the development of adequate simulation models for EM fields with penetration depths less than 1 mm. In a further step, it covers the provision of absolutely needed dielectric tissue parameters with help of the \u201ceffective medium theory,\u201d since material properties above 100 GHz are not listed in the commonly consulted databases. The absorbed power in EM exposed human skin models of different complexity is calculated and subsequently used as heat source for temperature simulations. Spatial and time-dependent temperature profiles in the tissue are analyzed for transient and continuous exposures.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "978", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "989", "date_publication": "Wed Sep 30 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15615670", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "978 - 989", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Oliver Spathmann", "Martin Zang", "Joachim Streckert", "Volkert Hansen", "Mehrdad Saviz", "Thomas M.
