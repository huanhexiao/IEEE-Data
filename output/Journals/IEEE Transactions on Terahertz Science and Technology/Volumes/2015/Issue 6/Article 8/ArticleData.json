Analytical dispersion equations are derived for several GCW geometries, considering the presence of an inner metallic core and multiple (coaxial-like) graphene layers. The proposed formulation reveals a fundamental connection between surface plasmons found in GCWs/carbon nanotubes and planar graphene structures. Numerical results confirm the higher confinement of modes supported by GCWs compared with their planar counterparts, while keeping a similar level of losses. The proposed structure is applied to develop plasmonic reconfigurable dipole antennas in the low THz band, which provide higher radiation efficiency than current graphene-based radiators, without requiring the presence of bulky lenses. We envision that the proposed GCWs may find application in reconfigurable THz transceivers, near-field application, wireless interconnects, and sensing systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "951", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "960", "date_publication": "Wed Sep 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15615673", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "951 - 960", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Diego Correas-Serrano", "Juan Sebastian Gomez-Diaz", "Andrea Al\u00f9", "Alejandro \u00c1lvarez Melc\u00f3n"], "keywords": ["antenna radiation patterns", "carbon nanotubes", "circular waveguides", "dipole antennas", "graphene", "metamaterial antennas", "millimetre wave antennas", "millimetre wave propagation", "planar antennas", "plasmonics", "surface plasmons", "waveguide antennas", "GCW", "antennas radiation efficiency", "bulky lens", "carbon nanotube", "current graphene-based radiator", "dispersion equation", "electrically biased graphene-based cylindrical waveguide", "inner metallic core layer", "magnetically biased graphene-based cylindrical waveguide", "multiple graphene layer", "near-field application", "planar graphene structure", "plasmonic reconfigurable dipole antenna", "reconfigurable THz transceiver", "surface wave propagation", "wireless interconnects", "Chemicals", "Dispersion", "Graphene", "Magnetic cores", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Plasmons", "Surface waves", "Graphene", "plasmonics", "reconfigurable antennas", "terahertz (THz)", ""], "arnumber": "7270352"}
