Techniques for precise measurement using a vector network analyzer and on-wafer probing and simulation based on the SPICE model are introduced. Several MOSFETs in various channel dimensions are fabricated in 65-nm CMOS technology and measured over gate bias voltage and the operating frequencies of 110, 200, and 300 GHz using the lock-in technique. The behavior of responsivity and noise equivalent power (NEP) depending on the channel width and length of the MOSFET and the frequency are investigated, and trends of the obtained results are in good agreement with the theories and the simulations. The channel width dependence of the responsivity of the MOSFET detector is evaluated and explained for the first time. The results of this work can provide a reliable and useful reference for the design of THz detectors.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1068", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "1077", "date_publication": "Mon Oct 26 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15615659", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "1068 - 1077", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Suna Kim", "Dae-Woong Park", "Kyoung-Young Choi", "Sang-Gug Lee"], "keywords": ["CMOS integrated circuits", "MOSFET", "SPICE", "network analysers", "terahertz wave detectors", "terahertz wave imaging", "CMOS technology", "MOSFET characteristics", "MOSFET detector", "NEP", "SPICE model", "frequency 110 GHz", "frequency 200 GHz", "frequency 300 GHz", "gate bias voltage", "lock-in technique", "noise equivalent power", "on-wafer measurement", "on-wafer probing", "responsivity", "size 65 nm", "terahertz detector application", "vector network analyzer", "Detectors", "Frequency measurement", "Logic gates", "MOSFET", "Power measurement", "SPICE", "Distributed resistive mixing", "MOSFET power detector", "gate spreading resistance", "loading effect", "maximum oscillation frequency", "on-wafer measurement", "parasitic gate to bulk capacitance", "plasma wave detection", "terahertz (THz) detection", ""], "arnumber": "7305836"}
