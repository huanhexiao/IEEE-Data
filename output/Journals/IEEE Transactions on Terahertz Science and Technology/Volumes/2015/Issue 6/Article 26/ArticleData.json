The main design goals of large bandwidth and high gain are achieved by cascading three bandwidth-optimized traveling-wave amplifier stages. The termination resistance variations, which have large influence on the gain, are compensated by implementing electrically trimmable resistors. Measurements of the amplifier trimmed for optimum gain flatness show a gain of 18.7 dB over a 3-dB bandwidth of 180 GHz. To the authors' best knowledge, the resulting gain-bandwidth product of 1.6 THz is the highest reported to date.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1094", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "1096", "date_publication": "Wed Oct 14 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15615672", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "1094 - 1096", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["David Fritsche", "Gregor Tretter", "Corrado Carta", "Frank Ellinger"], "keywords": ["BiCMOS integrated circuits", "Ge-Si alloys", "MIMIC", "distributed amplifiers", "travelling wave amplifiers", "SiGe", "bandwidth 180 GHz", "bandwidth-optimized traveling-wave amplifier stage", "electrically-trimmable resistors", "gain 18.7 dB", "gain-bandwidth product", "optimum gain flatness", "silicon-germanium BiCMOS technology", "size 0.13 mum", "termination resistance variation", "trimmable cascaded distributed amplifier", "Bandwidth", "Gain", "Integrated circuits", "Noise measurement", "Power transmission lines", "Resistance", "Resistors", "BiCMOS integrated circuits", "broadband amplifiers", "distributed amplifiers", "millimeter-wave integrated circuits", ""], "arnumber": "7298467"}
