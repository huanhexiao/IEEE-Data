A thermograph, a thermal sensitive phosphor plate, and a microbolometer array were applied to recording of holograms in the spectral ranges of 128-160 \u03bcm and 68 \u03bcm, including recording in real time. Specific features of these devices are described in detail. Five methods of image reconstruction are analyzed and verified using recorded holograms. Prospects for the use of THz holography are discussed in brief.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "836", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "844", "date_publication": "Fri Aug 14 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15415782", "date": "Sept. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 31 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "5", "pages": "836 - 844", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Yulia Yu.
