In this study, we propose a calibration-free method for real-time power measurement of an electron cyclotron maser system, a so-called gyrotron. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method by using a recently developed W-band gyrotron with a peak power of tens of kilowatts. The technique is based on transmitter antenna power measurement by using the Friis transmission equation with a defined gyrotron antenna gain. The new technique will allow extremely simple and accurate real-time measurement of output power over a wide dynamic range ( dB) for continuous wave sources to high-power millimeter/THz wave sources with nanosecond pulse lengths.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "779", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "785", "date_publication": "Wed Aug 19 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15415785", "date": "Sept. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 31 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "5", "pages": "779 - 785", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Sung Gug Kim", "Jung Ho Kim", "Dongsung Kim", "Jong-Hyo Won", "Woo Sang Lee", "Jongwon Yang", "EunMi Choi"], "keywords": ["cyclotrons", "gyrotrons", "masers", "millimetre wave antennas", "millimetre wave generation", "power measurement", "transmitting antennas", "Friis transmission equation", "W-band gyrotron", "absolute power measurements", "calibration-free method", "continuous wave sources", "electron cyclotron maser system", "gyrotron antenna gain", "high-power millimeter-THz wave generators", "high-power millimeter-THz wave sources", "nanosecond pulse lengths", "one-point schottky detector signal", "real-time power measurement", "transmitter antenna power measurement", "Cyclotrons", "Gyrotrons", "Power generation", "Power measurement", "Receivers", "Transmitting antennas", "Gaussian beam", "antenna gain", "calorimeter", "gyrotron", "power measurement", ""], "arnumber": "7210233"}
