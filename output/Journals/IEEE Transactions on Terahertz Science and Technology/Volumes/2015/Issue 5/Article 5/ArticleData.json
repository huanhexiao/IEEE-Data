The THz pulses propagated through rain falling at 3.5 mm/h and snow falling at 2 cm/h equivalent to 2.0 mm/h rainfall. For calm weather, the transmitted THz pulseshapes and relative transit times were measured to a precision of 0.1 ps. These broadband measurements demonstrate the potential of line-of-sight THz communications, THz sensing, and THz imaging through fog and smoke.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "742", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "750", "date_publication": "Tue Jul 28 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15415787", "date": "Sept. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 31 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "5", "pages": "742 - 750", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Eom-Bae Moon", "Tae-In Jeon", "Daniel R.
