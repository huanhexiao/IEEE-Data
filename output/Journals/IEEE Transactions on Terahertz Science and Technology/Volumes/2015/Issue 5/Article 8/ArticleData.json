The system aims at industrial processes such as offset print and paper production. The moisture content in the paper is derived through an accurate measurement of the loss of a signal transmitted through the paper. The system is designed to achieve high accuracy in the measurement of the loss presented by the paper, not affected by 1/f or drift noise. The sensor is capable of resolving 0.005 dB loss achieving a moisture resolution of 0.1% for moisture content higher than 15%. The resolution can be improved if necessary in exchange for longer measurement times. The sensor is tested in offset print and paper production processes and measured values are compared to laboratory measured samples of the paper.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "770", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "778", "date_publication": "Fri Aug 14 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15415784", "date": "Sept. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 31 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "5", "pages": "770 - 778", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Vessen Vassilev", "Borys Stoew", "Jakob Blomgren", "Gert Andersson"], "keywords": ["loss measurement", "millimetre wave detectors", "moisture measurement", "paper making", "1/f noise", "drift noise", "frequency 200 GHz", "industrial processing", "loss 0.005 dB", "mm-wave sensor", "moisture sensor", "paper production", "print production", "remote moisture measurement", "signal transmitted loss measurement", "thin paper layer", "water con- tent measurement", "Attenuation measurement", "Frequency measurement", "Loss measurement", "Moisture", "Moisture measurement", "Noise measurement", "Time measurement", "Detectors", "Schottky diodes", "flicker noise", "microwave sensors", "millimeter-wave (mm) technology", "moisture control", "process control", "radiometers", ""], "arnumber": "7202922"}
