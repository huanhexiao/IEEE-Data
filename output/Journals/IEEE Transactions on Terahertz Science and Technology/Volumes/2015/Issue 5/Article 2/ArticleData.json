The propagation length of the surface plasmons (SPs), stimulated by a 6 THz TM polarized incident wave along this waveguide with a top graphene layer whose chemical potential is held at \u03bcC=300 meV (ON state) is more than 35 times larger than that in the waveguide with \u03bcC = 0 eV (OFF state). Numerical results, obtained from full wave simulations using a finite element method, also show that the modulation depth density obtained for the straight plasmonic switching waveguide, whose length is just about 20% of the incident wavelength, is larger than those reported to date. Moreover, we also designed a logic AND gate composed of a straight waveguide, a Y-branch switch, and a logic OR gate composed of two face to face Y-branches, whose total lengths are ~ 37%, ~ 45%, and ~ 53% of the incident wavelength, respectively. Simulations show that the maximum ON/OFF ratios for these subwavelength plasmonic waveguides that occur between their `1 1' and `0 0' logical states are ~ 41.37, ~ 39.87, and ~ 40.76 dB, respectively. These numerical data also show that the modulation depth densities obtained for these devices are also greater than those reported to date. The proposed graphene-based plasmonic switches and gates offer potential building blocks for the future digital plasmonic circuits operating around 6 THz.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "725", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "731", "date_publication": "Mon Aug 03 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15415774", "date": "Sept. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 31 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "5", "pages": "725 - 731", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Morteza Yarahmadi", "Mohammad K.
