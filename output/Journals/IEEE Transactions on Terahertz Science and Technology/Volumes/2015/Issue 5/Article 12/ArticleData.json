Polymer composite materials (PCMs) appear to be the most common type of composites. PCMs consist mainly of polymer binder reinforced with the glass-fiber-fabric. Although PCMs are widely applied, PCM manufacturing technology lacks the methods of non- destructive testing. In this paper we demonstrate that terahertz (THz) pulsed spectroscopy (TPS) appears to be a unique instrument for solving important problems of PCM manufacturing control. We experimentally demonstrate the efficiency of TPS for non-destructive control of PCM binder polymerization, since THz radiation is sensitive to changes of picosecond dynamics in media. Furthermore, we show the ability to detect the internal non-impregnated voids inside the PCM structure by means of THz time-of-flight tomography. These results highlight the potentials of TPS applications for non-destructive control of PCM manufacturing process.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology", "firstpage": "810", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "816", "date_publication": "Fri Aug 14 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society", "inspec": "15415778", "date": "Sept. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 31 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "5", "pages": "810 - 816", "issn": "2156-342X"}, "authors": ["Egor V.
