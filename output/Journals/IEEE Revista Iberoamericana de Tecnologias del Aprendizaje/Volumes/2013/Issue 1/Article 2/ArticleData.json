We use real data on 670 middle-school students from Zacatecas, Me\u0301xico, and employ white-box classification methods, such as induction rules and decision trees. Experiments attempt to improve their accuracy for predicting which students might fail or dropout by first, using all the available attributes; next, selecting the best attributes; and finally, rebalancing data and using cost sensitive classification. The outcomes have been compared and the models with the best results are shown.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "7", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "14", "date_publication": "Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "13355451", "date": "Feb. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "1", "pages": "7 - 14", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Carlos Marquez-Vera", "Crist\u00f3bal Romero Morales", "Sebasti\u00e1n Ventura Soto"], "keywords": ["data mining", "decision trees", "educational administrative data processing", "pattern classification", "cost sensitive classification", "data mining techniques", "decision trees", "induction rules", "middle-school students", "school dropout prediction", "school failure prediction", "white-box classification methods", "Behavioral science", "Classification", "Classification algorithms", "Data mining", "Decision trees", "Failure analysis", "Prediction methods", "Writing", "Classification", "dropout", "educational data mining (EDM)", "prediction", "school failure", ""], "arnumber": "6461622"}
