In these classes, students learn while carrying out tasks similar to those they could encounter in a professional environment. These activities help to strengthen the theoretical principles while allowing the students to develop useful skills for their careers. In this paper, we present three experiences (Lab Battle, Lab Race, and Lab Triathlon) in the organization of practical activities based on the paradigms of competitiveness and project-oriented learning. The goal of these techniques is to immerse the students in an environment as realistic as possible. In such scenarios, it is often important to be first, to think like the \u201cbad guy\u201d or to keep confidentiality. After three years applying these techniques, we have observed great motivation and excellent competences in the students. Moreover, cheating has been less frequent than in other types of lab assignments.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "39", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "46", "date_publication": "Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "13355450", "date": "Feb. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "1", "pages": "39 - 46", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Xabiel Garc\u00eda Paneda", "David Melendi", "Sergio Cabrero", "Raquel Blanco", "Roberto Garcia", "Abel Rionda Rodriguez"], "keywords": ["competitive algorithms", "computer aided instruction", "engineering education", "groupware", "human factors", "laboratory techniques", "student experiments", "bad guy", "excellent competences", "information and communication technologies", "lab assignments", "laboratory work", "motivation", "paradigm-based practical activities", "professional environment", "project-oriented learning-based competitive lab activities", "technical degrees", "Collaborative work", "Electronic mail", "Engineering education", "Information technology", "Laboratories", "Network security", "Project management", "Teamwork", "Web pages", "Collaborative work", "IT engineering", "competition", "laboratories", "practical work", "project-oriented learning (POL)", ""], "arnumber": "6461621"}
