TrivialCV was designed as an instructor-oriented tool, in order to foster the organization of these types of innovative activities by facilitating the instructor's task. This goal is achieved by providing easy-to-use graphical tools and a kit of integration services that allow TrivialCV to be integrated with popular e-learning tools (e.g., Moodle-based environments). Integration is achieved by using an extensible plugin that can be generalized to support different e-Learning tools and even different external activities. The article describes the general architecture designed to integrate TrivialCV with different e-learning tools, and the specific implementation developed to integrate it with the Virtual Campus at the Complutense University (based in Moodle v1.9).", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "38", "date_publication": "Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "13355449", "date": "Feb. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "1", "pages": "31 - 38", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Pablo Moreno-Ger", "Iv\u00e1n Martinez-Ortiz", "Virginia Francisco Gilmartin", "Raquel Herv\u00e1s Ballesteros"], "keywords": ["computer aided instruction", "educational institutions", "virtual reality", "Complutense University", "Moodle v1.9", "Moodle virtual campus", "Moodle-based environment", "TrivialCV", "classroom", "e-learning tool", "easy-to-use graphical tool", "innovative activities", "instructor task", "instructor-oriented tool", "plugin", "team-based competitive activities", "Collaboration", "Computer aided instruction", "Electronic learning", "Games", "Learning systems", "Least squares approximation", "Teamwork", "Virtual environments", "Computer aided instruction", "educational technology", "game-based learning", "virtual learning environments", ""], "arnumber": "6461620"}
