This paper presents the efforts carried out by six telematics, computer science and electronic engineering education teachers toward achieving this alignment in their subjects. In a joint work with pedagogues, a set of recommended actions are identified. A selection of these actions are applied and evaluated in the six subjects. The cross analysis of the results indicates that the actions allow students to better understand the methodologies and assessments planned for the subjects, facilitate (self-) regulation, and increase students' involvement in the subjects.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "15", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "13355448", "date": "Feb. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "1", "pages": "15 - 22", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Davinia Hernandez-Leo", "Ver\u00f3nica Moreno Oliver", "Juan M.
