This authentication model is applied in distance education where courses are developed in learning management systems. It introduces the features of distance education as well as the biometric sensor operation. It describes the changes that are necessary to introduce the learning management system in order to use the fingerprint as data in the process of authentication. Finally, we perform tests of assessment for the new authentication system in lab sessions at the college.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "Thu Feb 14 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "13355447", "date": "Feb. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "1", "pages": "23 - 30", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Rosario Gil", "Gabriel D\u00edaz Orueta", "Mohamed Tawfik", "Felix Garcia-Loro", "Alberto Pesquera Martin", "Elio Sancristobal", "Sergio Martin", "Manuel Castro"], "keywords": ["distance learning", "educational courses", "fingerprint identification", "message authentication", "Moodle", "authentication model", "authentication system", "biometric sensor operation", "biometric technology", "distance education", "educational courses", "fingerprint authentication", "fingerprint verification system", "lab sessions", "learning management systems", "password", "traditional authentication", "username", "Access control", "Authentication", "Biometrics (access control)", "DIstance learning", "Fingerprint recognition", "Industrial engineering", "Passwords", "Biometric", "distance education", "login", "moodle", "verification", ""], "arnumber": "6461618"}
