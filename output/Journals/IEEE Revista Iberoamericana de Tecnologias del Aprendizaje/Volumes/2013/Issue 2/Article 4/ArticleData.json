To consolidate the results obtained from classroom activities, lecturers must develop tools to encourage learning and facilitate the process of independent learning. The aim of this paper is to present the use of virtual laboratories based on Easy Java Simulations to assist in the understanding and testing of electrical machines.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "71", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "76", "date_publication": "May 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "13502336", "date": "May 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu May 16 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "2", "pages": "71 - 76", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Pau Casals-Torrens"], "keywords": ["Java", "computer aided instruction", "electric machine analysis computing", "further education", "induction motors", "machine testing", "power engineering education", "virtual instrumentation", "Easy Java Simulations", "European higher education area framework", "asynchronous motor learning", "classroom activities", "electrical machine testing", "engineering degrees", "knowledge reinforcement", "learning ability", "skills acquisition", "virtual laboratory", "Electric machines", "Europe", "Java", "Learning systems", "Load modeling", "Mathematical model", "Remote laboratories", "Synchronous motors", "Virtual environments", "Easy java simulation (EJS)", "electric machines", "learning", "simulation", "virtual laboratory", ""], "arnumber": "6516950"}
