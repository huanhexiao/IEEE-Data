However, a problem that frequently occurs in the implementation of PBL is the presence of passive students who usually have difficulty working in teams or who are unmotivated during the process of teaching and learning. An aspect that can positively influence the implementation process of the PBL is the recommendation of context-sensitive learning objects (LOs). Thus, this paper presents an approach based on an animated pedagogical agent and three other agents for the detection of passive students and for the recommendation of LOs in accordance with the students' context to improve the learning process of PBL.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "56", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "63", "date_publication": "Mon Apr 29 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "13517183", "date": "May 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu May 16 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "2", "pages": "56 - 63", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Laysa Mabel de Oliveira Fontes", "Francisco Milton Mendes Neto", "F\u00e1bio Abrantes Diniz", "Danilo Gomes Carlos", "Luiz J\u00e1come J\u00fanior", "Luiz Cl\u00e1udio Nogueira da Silva"], "keywords": ["computer aided instruction", "computer animation", "groupware", "software agents", "teaching", "team working", "PBL", "animated pedagogical agent", "collaboration", "context-sensitive learning object", "learning process improvement", "learning theory", "passive student detection", "problem-based learning", "teaching", "teamwork", "Collaboration", "Context awareness", "Learning systems", "Ontologies", "Problem-solving", "Software agents", "Teamwork", "Animated pedagogical agent", "learning object", "problem-based learning", "software agent", ""], "arnumber": "6509940"}
