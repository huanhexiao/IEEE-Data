Most current learning technologies do not consider this paper-centric practice and focus on a complete digitization of learning contents, activities, and communication. This paper presents an e-learning platform that combines work with printed and digital documents. It integrates pen-and-paper-based interaction techniques that enable users to manage their digitized documents. In addition, this platform integrates different e-learning platforms providing a single intuitive interface to manage them. Finally, a case study of the use of the platform in university education is presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "48", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "55", "date_publication": "May 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "13502338", "date": "May 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu May 16 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "2", "pages": "48 - 55", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Ana Bel\u00e9n Lago Vilari\u00f1o", "Iv\u00e1n Pretel Garc\u00eda"], "keywords": ["computer aided instruction", "document handling", "further education", "automatic learning content digitization", "digital documents", "digitized document management", "e-learning platform", "integrated document management", "knowledge work", "learning technologies", "learning work", "paper-centric practice", "pen-and-paper-based interaction techniques", "printed documents", "university education", "Collaboration", "Collaborative work", "Electronic learning", "Google", "Learning systems", "Real-time systems", "Digital pen", "Google", "Moodle", "learning management system", ""], "arnumber": "6517029"}
