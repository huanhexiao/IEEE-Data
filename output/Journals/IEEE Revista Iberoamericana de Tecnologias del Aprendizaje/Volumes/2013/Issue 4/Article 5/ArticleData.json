Lean manufacturing is a management philosophy oriented to the elimination of activities that do not create any type of value and are thus considered a waste. One of the main differences from other management philosophies is the shop-floor focus and the operators' involvement. Therefore, the training of all organization levels is crucial for the success of lean manufacturing. Universities should also participate actively in this process by developing students' lean management skills and promoting a better and faster integration of students into their future organizations. This paper proposes a single realistic manufacturing platform, involving production and assembly operations, to learn by playing many of the lean tools such as VSM, 5S, SMED, poke-yoke, line balance, TPM, Mizusumashi, plant layout, and JIT/kanban. This simulation game was built in tight cooperation with experienced lean companies under the international program \u201cLean Learning Academy,\u201dhttp://www.leanlearningacademy.eu/ and its main aim is to make bachelor and master courses in applied sciences more attractive by integrating classic lectures with a simulated production environment that could result in more motivated students and higher study yields. The simulation game results show that our approach is efficient in providing a realistic platform for the effective learning of lean principles, tools, and mindset, which can be easily included in course classes of less than two hours.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "184", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "190", "date_publication": "Wed Oct 16 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "13934242", "date": "Nov. 2013", "date_current_version": "Tue Nov 26 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "4", "pages": "184 - 190", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Ant\u00f3nio Galr\u00e3o Ramos", "Manuel Pereira Lopes", "Paulo Silva \u00c1vila"], "keywords": ["assembling", "educational courses", "educational institutions", "just-in-time", "kanban", "lean production", "production engineering", "5S", "JIT/kanban", "Lean Learning Academy", "Mizusumashi", "SMED", "TPM", "VSM", "applied sciences", "assembly operations", "bachelor courses", "business competitiveness", "course classes", "economic globalization", "international program", "lean companies", "lean manufacturing simulation games", "line balance", "master courses", "plant layout", "poke-yoke", "production operations", "realistic manufacturing platform", "shop-floor focus", "simulated production environment", "students", "Games", "Globalization", "Manufacturing processes", "Production facilities", "Serious games", "Lean", "lean manufacturing", "simulation games", ""], "arnumber": "6634214"}
