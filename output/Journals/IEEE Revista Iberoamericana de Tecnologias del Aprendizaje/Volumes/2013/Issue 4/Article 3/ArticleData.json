Developing Process, Design, and Programming Considerations Against Technical Issues", "abstract": "This paper presents the development of Kroster, a serious game created for digital television using multimedia home platform (MHP) technology. The process of game creation is described from both an engineering and design point of view with discussion on various programming and graphical aspects. Some of the requirements for the development of a t-learning game are described, as are the restrictions associated with the TV platform, especially within the MHP development framework.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "166", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "175", "date_publication": "Wed Oct 16 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "13934243", "date": "Nov. 2013", "date_current_version": "Tue Nov 26 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "4", "pages": "166 - 175", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Iv\u00e1n Abad\u00eda Quintero", "Madelayne Morales Rodr\u00edguez", "Camilo Orteg\u00f3n Barajas", "Juan Vicente Pradilla Cer\u00f3n", "Patricia Madri\u00f1\u00e1n Rodriguez", "Andr\u00e9s Navarro Cadavid"], "keywords": ["digital television", "graphical user interfaces", "middleware", "serious games (computing)", "Kroster-MHP game", "MHP development framework", "Multimedia Home Platform technology", "digital TV design", "digital TV development process", "digital TV programming", "game creation process", "graphical aspects", "programming aspects", "serious game", "t-learning game development", "Digital TV", "Entertainment industry", "Games", "Home automation", "Multimedia communication", "Programming", "Digital television", "design and programming", "game", "multimedia home platform (MHP)", "t-learning", "technical aspects", ""], "arnumber": "6634220"}
