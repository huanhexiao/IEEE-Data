In addition, to perform the programming-related tasks, it is common to use professional integrated development environments. Thus, it may be interesting to integrate tools in these environments so that they can support the teaching/learning process. This paper discusses how we have adapted an existing eclipse-based system for learning programming, so that now it has support for collaborative tasks. The new features have been specially designed to solve programming-related assignments and integrated into the learning environment. We also analyze the first impressions gathered from students in the initial experiences made on the system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "153", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "162", "date_publication": "Wed Oct 16 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "13934244", "date": "Nov. 2013", "date_current_version": "Tue Nov 26 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "4", "pages": "153 - 162", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Francisco Jurado", "Ana I.
