Lean is a manufacturing philosophy that deserves the attention of employers and their employees, since its objectives are to increase productivity, reduce waste, and optimize available resources. The 5S method is a lean tool that can improve productivity by improving the organization of the workplace. A brief survey of the market showed that there are several organizations dedicated to training and sharing this type of knowledge but only a few of them have digital tools available. Therefore, the use of a digital serious game that helps to understand the 5S method can effectively support an alternative form of learning. This article proposes a serious game that aims to respond to this need. This practical approach encourages the player to learn by trial and error. Information displayed throughout the game enhances learning, without a cognitive overload for the player. The game's evaluation has shown that our approach is efficient and results in the learning of 5S concepts.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "191", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "196", "date_publication": "Thu Oct 17 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "13934246", "date": "Nov. 2013", "date_current_version": "Tue Nov 26 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "4", "pages": "191 - 196", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Duarte F.
