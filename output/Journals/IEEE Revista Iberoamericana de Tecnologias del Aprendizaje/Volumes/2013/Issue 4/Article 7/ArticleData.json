We believe that educational games are an excellent medium for addressing this issue. This article describes the design and implementation of a videogame based on La Dama Boba, Lope de Vega's stage play. The aim of the videogame is to motivate young people to go to classical theater plays and to familiarize students with the plot and the characters before they go to the theater. This goal is achieved by making avatars interesting to players, by incorporating different theater techniques to generate characters' personalities and by including the elements that can be used as audiovisual content such as music, scenery, and costume design. In this paper, we also present the results of an initial evaluation of the game with master's students from the E-learning group. In order to improve the game, we have studied its effects in terms of improvement of knowledge, learning outcomes, and student motivation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "197", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "204", "date_publication": "Thu Oct 17 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "13934245", "date": "Nov. 2013", "date_current_version": "Tue Nov 26 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "4", "pages": "197 - 204", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Borja Manero Iglesias", "Clara Fern\u00e1ndez-Vara", "Baltasar Fern\u00e1ndez-Manj\u00f3n"], "keywords": ["avatars", "computer aided instruction", "humanities", "serious games (computing)", "La Dama Boba", "audiovisual content", "avatars", "character personality", "classical drama", "classical theater plays", "costume design", "e-learning group", "educational games", "master students", "serious game", "student motivation", "theater techniques", "videogame", "young people", "Avatars", "Educational institutions", "Electronic learning", "Games", "Serious games", "Spain", "Educational technology", "computer aided instruction", "computer games for drama learning", "drama", "game-based learning", "serious games", "virtual learning environments", ""], "arnumber": "6636074"}
