In this paper, the description of the process of creation of learning content is addressed. A group of students in the first year of an engineering degree collaboratively constructs a blog that covers the real-life applications of the physical concepts that are studied. We identify the characteristics that define meaningful learning during the development of the task and analyze the advantages and problems related to the use of Web 2.0 applications and Internet as learning tools.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "111", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "118", "date_publication": "Tue Jul 16 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "13710019", "date": "Aug. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 22 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "3", "pages": "111 - 118", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Ana Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez Torres", "Crist\u00f3bal Nico Su\u00e1rez Guerrero"], "keywords": ["Internet", "computer aided instruction", "engineering education", "groupware", "Internet", "Web 2.0 applications", "content development learning", "engineering degree", "learner generated content", "learning process", "learning tools", "real-life applications", "social tools", "Blogs", "Content management", "Context awareness", "Engineering education", "Knowledge engineering", "Social network services", "Web 2.0", "Active learning", "Engineering education", "web 20 learning tools", ""], "arnumber": "6560395"}
