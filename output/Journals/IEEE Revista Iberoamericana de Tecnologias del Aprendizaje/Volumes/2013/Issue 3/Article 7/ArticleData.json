A preparatory virtual laboratory is available to the students in addition to the traditional one so that they are encouraged not just to follow the theory but to try some practical exercises. In this way practical sessions in laboratories developed during the academic year can be supplemented by electronic instrumentation. Besides this the student can carry out, both for on-site and blended activities, a wide range of practices about tests and measurements in electronic circuits. The three virtual instruments have been developed and set up in a LabVIEW environment. This way the students just need a PC, a data acquisition card, and a breadboard so that electronic circuits can be subjected to tests and measurements.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "143", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "151", "date_publication": "Wed Jul 17 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "13710021", "date": "Aug. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 22 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "3", "pages": "143 - 151", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["I\u00f1igo J.
