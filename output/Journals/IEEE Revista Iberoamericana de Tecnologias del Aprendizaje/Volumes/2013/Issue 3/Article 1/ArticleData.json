The intention of combining mobility and remote experimentation is to minimize the space-time barrier, providing students with faster access to information to continue their technology and engineering studies. The architecture of the technologies presented in this paper has been implemented based on the integration of a learning management system (Moodle), 3D virtual worlds (3Di-OpenSim), and remote experiments. The resources are all based on open source and hardware provided by the Laboratory of Remote Experimentation of Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Brazil.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "97", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "102", "date_publication": "Tue Jul 16 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "13732657", "date": "Aug. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 22 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "3", "pages": "97 - 102", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Juarez Bento da Silva", "Willian Rochadel", "Roderval Marcelino", "Vilson Gruber"], "keywords": ["computer aided instruction", "engineering education", "mobile computing", "mobile radio", "public domain software", "student experiments", "virtual reality", "3D virtual world", "3Di-OpenSim", "Brazil", "Laboratory of Remote Experimentation", "Moodle", "NICT", "Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina", "engineering studies", "hardware", "information access", "learning management system", "mobile device", "mobility", "open source", "space-time barrier", "student", "technology architecture", "technology studies", "Context awareness", "Laboratories", "Learning systems", "Mobile communication", "Mobile handsets", "Remote laboratories", "Testing", "Three dimensional displays", "3D virtual environments", "Remote experimentation", "mobile devices", "teaching-learning process", ""], "arnumber": "6560385"}
