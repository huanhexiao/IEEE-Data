It also gives the option of working with the same platform to a group of users to test their algorithms by turns. The system is based on a Wi-Fi router updated with a Linux firmware connected to a control board that manages the hardware of a mobile robot. The microprocessor has also been loaded with the Player Server environment, which is widely used in commercial robotic platforms for research.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "126", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "132", "date_publication": "Wed Jul 17 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "13710020", "date": "Aug. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 22 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "3", "pages": "126 - 132", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Guillermo As\u00edn Prieto", "Julio Pastor Mendoza"], "keywords": ["Linux", "firmware", "mobile robots", "wireless LAN", "La Fonera hardware", "Linux firmware", "Player Server environment", "Wi-Fi router", "didactic robotic platform", "microprocessor", "mobile robot", "player/stage software architecture", "remote laboratory", "robotic platforms", "Electronic learning", "IEEE 802.11 Standards", "Mobile robots", "Remote laboratories", "Robot sensing systems", "Robots", "Servers", "Software architecture", "La Fonera", "Player/Stage", "low cost", "remote laboratory", "robot", ""], "arnumber": "6562774"}
