This proposal was addressed to third-year engineering students and combines knowledge from computer vision and robotic control to complete an automation project task. The learning target was to develop a computer vision system that must detect a small object placed randomly on a target surface and control an educational robotic arm to pick it up and move it to a predefined destination. The educational results of this experience have shown that the development of a practical-learning case based on the combination of computer vision and robotics has increased the motivation of the students and improved the assimilation of theoretical concepts.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "135", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "142", "date_publication": "Fri Jul 19 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "13710022", "date": "Aug. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 22 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "3", "pages": "135 - 142", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Tom\u00e0s Pallej\u00e0 Cabr\u00e9", "Merc\u00e8 Teixid\u00f3 Cairol", "Davinia Font Calafell", "Marcel Tresanchez Ribes", "Jordi Palac\u00edn Roca"], "keywords": ["computer aided instruction", "computer vision", "educational robots", "manipulators", "University of Lleida", "automation project task", "computer vision system", "educational robotic arm", "object detection", "practical-learning case", "project-based learning case example", "robotic control", "Cameras", "Computer vision", "Electronic learning", "Image color analysis", "MATLAB", "Robot vision systems", "Robots", "Project-based learning", "computer vision", "practical-learning", "robotic arm", ""], "arnumber": "6564448"}
