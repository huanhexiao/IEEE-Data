Their underlying pedagogical model is often based on final or end-of-course projects, which carry a high number of ECTS credits (12 or more), to be completed over one semester. Each project, which simulates a real life professional situation, is completed by an individual student or a group of students in their last year of a university graduate or post-graduate course, in the case of engineering and architecture degrees. The special and complex perculiarities of these atypical assignments mean that they are not easily adapted to a virtual learning environment. This paper defines a management process for such projects and introduces a Moodle 1.9 module for its implementation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "103", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "110", "date_publication": "Thu Jul 11 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "13710018", "date": "Aug. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 22 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "3", "pages": "103 - 110", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Carlos L\u00f3pez Nozal", "Jos\u00e9 Francisco Diez Pastor", "Jes\u00fas Maudes Raedo", "Ra\u00fal Marticorena S\u00e1nchez"], "keywords": ["computer aided instruction", "educational courses", "engineering education", "further education", "project management", "Bachelor qualifications", "Bachelor studies", "ECTS credits", "Master qualifications", "Master studies", "Moodle 1.9 module", "architecture degrees", "engineering degrees", "innovative Moodle final project management module", "real life professional situation", "university graduate course", "university post-graduate course", "virtual learning environment", "Distance learning", "Electronic learning", "Engineering education", "Learning systems", "Monitoring", "Project management", "Technological innovation", "Bachelor and master's project management", "Moodle", "e-learning", "management models", ""], "arnumber": "6557438"}
