This project intended to promote an autonomous learning and improve the structure of videoconferences, thus helping students to enhance their foreign language competence. Every participant had to assess their own teaching perspective and learning style, the quality of the resources used during the videoconference, as well as their level of satisfaction with it. To evaluate the teaching style, the content of the videoconference and its value as a tool or resource for learning or both, a new instrument has been devised and validated. Partial results confirm the success of this initiative, considering the number of participants and viewers of the tutorials, and provide constructive feedback for future improved versions of the project.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "119", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "125", "date_publication": "Tue Jul 16 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "13732658", "date": "Aug. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 22 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "3", "pages": "119 - 125", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Ana Mar\u00eda Mart\u00edn-Cuadrado", "M. \u00c1ngeles L\u00f3pez-Gonz\u00e1lez", "Andr\u00e9s Garc\u00eda-Arce"], "keywords": ["computer aided instruction", "distance learning", "teaching", "teleconferencing", "Universidad Nacional de Educacio&#x0301", "n a Distancia", "Utah Valley University", "autonomous learning", "foreign language competence enhancement", "innovation network", "teaching style evaluation", "teaching support", "videoconferencing", "Blogs", "Distance learning", "Educational institutions", "Electronic learning", "Engineering education", "Pragmatics", "Videoconferences", "Distance learning", "educational technology", "online communities", "videoconferencing", ""], "arnumber": "6560453"}
