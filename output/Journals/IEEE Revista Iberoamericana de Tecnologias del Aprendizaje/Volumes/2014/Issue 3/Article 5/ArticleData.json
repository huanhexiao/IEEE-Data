Teaching and learning processes are also affected. These technologies emphasize the fact that learning is not always linked to an institution or a period of time. However, institutional learning systems do not support these issues, which makes necessary the definition of personal learning environments. This paper describes the experience of the application of a mobile version of these personal environments in an educational context. It allows students the definition of their own personal environments in their mobile device and it is able to exchange information with the institutional systems. From this experience, it is possible to say the definition of mobile personal learning environments is possible, it increases learners' motivation and enriches their learning; and at the same time, it is possible to take into account what the learners do beyond the institution.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "114", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "121", "date_publication": "Fri Jul 25 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "14581885", "date": "Aug. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Sep 11 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "3", "pages": "114 - 121", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Miguel \u00c1ngel Conde Gonz\u00e1lez", "Francisco Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Pe\u00f1alvo"], "keywords": ["computer aided instruction", "computer science education", "human factors", "mobile computing", "software engineering", "educational context", "information and communication technologies", "information exchange", "institutional learning system", "learner motivation", "learning process", "mobile device", "mobile personal learning environment", "software engineering subject", "teaching process", "Communication channels", "Context", "Education", "Interoperability", "Least squares approximations", "Mobile communication", "Mobile handsets", "Interoperability", "LMS", "PLE", "mobile", "motivation", ""], "arnumber": "6866158"}
