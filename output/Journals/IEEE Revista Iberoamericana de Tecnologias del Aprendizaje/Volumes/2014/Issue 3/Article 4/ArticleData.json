The Integrated Journalism Workshop aims at responding to these needs by creating a simulated professional environment of an integrated editorial where students work in coordinated groups. This paper presents an extension of the LdShake platform to support the methodological needs of the workshop. The evaluation of the initial implementation of the platform provides a set of preliminary results that shows the platform is useful for the targeted purposes, improving the approach previously used in the course.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "106", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "113", "date_publication": "Fri Jul 25 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "14581886", "date": "Aug. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Sep 11 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "3", "pages": "106 - 113", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Jonathan Chac\u00f3n-P\u00e9rez", "Irene Da Rocha Fort", "Davinia Hern\u00e1ndez-Leo", "Josep Blat", "Salvador Alsius"], "keywords": ["education", "information dissemination", "publishing", "LdShake-based platform", "integrated editorial", "integrated journalism teaching", "integrated journalism workshop", "media convergence", "simulated professional environment", "Conferences", "Convergence", "Education", "Google", "Media", "Production", "TV", "Collaboration", "integration", "journalism", "platform", "teaching methodology", "technology", "university", ""], "arnumber": "6866180"}
