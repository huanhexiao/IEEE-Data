The project consisted in the development of a home and building automation system for practical teaching in vocational training. The system is based on the Arduino platform to allow the easy development of new applications and hardware modules. This paper also presents the first experiences of practical use at schools. The project has been granted by the Spanish Ministry of Education.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "91", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "97", "date_publication": "Fri Jul 25 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "14581884", "date": "Aug. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Sep 11 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "3", "pages": "91 - 97", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Mar\u00eda del Carmen Curr\u00e1s-Francos", "Javier Diz-Bugar\u00edn", "Juan Ram\u00f3n Garc\u00eda-Vila", "Angel Orte-Caballero"], "keywords": ["electronic engineering education", "home automation", "teaching", "vocational training", "Arduino-compatible building automation system", "practical electronics teaching", "vocational training", "Access control", "Building automation", "Companies", "Power supplies", "Radiofrequency identification", "Training", "Arduino", "Home automation", "vocational training", ""], "arnumber": "6866194"}
