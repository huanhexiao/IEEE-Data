Accordingly, a (students' skills) practice program, which can be done using either network simulation or real equipment, has been introduced in the core subject Telematics Architectures and Networks (TAN) of the second year of the bachelor's degree in Telecommunications Systems, Sound, and Image Engineering. The satisfactory evaluation of this innovative teaching methodology is proved by the rating of the surveys answered by the students after the course completion.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "82", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "90", "date_publication": "Fri Jul 25 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "14581882", "date": "Aug. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Sep 11 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "3", "pages": "82 - 90", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Mario Montagud", "Fernando Boronat"], "keywords": ["computer aided instruction", "educational courses", "teaching", "telecommunication computing", "telecommunication engineering education", "TAN", "Telecommunications Systems Sound and Image Engineering bachelor degree", "innovative teaching methodology", "learning resource", "network simulation", "practice program", "telematics architectures and networks", "telematics engineering", "IP networks", "Laboratories", "Network topology", "Protocols", "Telematics", "Training", "Telematics Engineering", "computer networks", "learning/training resources", "practical sessions", "simulation", ""], "arnumber": "6866149"}
