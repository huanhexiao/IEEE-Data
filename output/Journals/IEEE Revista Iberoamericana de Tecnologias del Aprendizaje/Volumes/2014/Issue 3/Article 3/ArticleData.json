The domain of the analytic performances in education emerges from the need to aggregate multiple sources of data, which the complexity of treatment associated with the ease of mobilizing selected information will make it possible to understand reality and optimize management actions. In this paper, we present the architecture and results achieved in the development of an academic analytics aggregator of multiple sources of data on the educational activity.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "98", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "105", "date_publication": "Fri Jul 25 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "14581883", "date": "Aug. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Sep 11 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "3", "pages": "98 - 105", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["S\u00e9rgio Andr\u00e9 Ferreira", "Ant\u00f3nio Andrade"], "keywords": ["educational administrative data processing", "educational institutions", "further education", "academic analytics aggregator", "administrative pedagogical management", "education analytic performances", "educational activity", "higher education institutions", "management actions", "quality purposes", "technologic subsystems", "university", "Bioinformatics", "Context", "Decision making", "Educational institutions", "Genomics", "Organizations", "Academic analytics", "data-driven decision making", "higher education", "learning analytics", "planning", ""], "arnumber": "6866210"}
