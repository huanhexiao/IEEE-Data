Consequently, we conducted an analysis of visualizations regarding three basic algorithm design techniques (divide and conquer, backtracking, and dynamic programming). The material analyzed was the illustrations found in prestigious algorithm textbooks, which prove to be high-quality sources. In this paper, we describe the methodology followed for our analysis and the results obtained, both general and specific of each algorithm design technique. The results are a first step in the way to identify design principles for algorithm visualizations based on algorithm-design techniques.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "57", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "63", "date_publication": "Wed Apr 16 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "14318543", "date": "May 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri May 16 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "2", "pages": "57 - 63", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Natalia Esteban-S\u00e1nchez", "Antonio P\u00e9rez-Carrasco", "Bel\u00e9n S\u00e1enz-Rubio", "J. \u00c1ngel Vel\u00e1zquez-Iturbide"], "keywords": ["backtracking", "computer aided instruction", "computer science education", "data visualisation", "divide and conquer methods", "dynamic programming", "algorithm design techniques", "algorithm textbooks", "algorithm visualizations", "backtracking", "computer aided instruction", "computer science education", "design principles", "divide and conquer", "dynamic programming", "educational purposes", "high-quality sources", "printed illustrations", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Classification algorithms", "Dynamic programming", "Electronic learning", "Heuristic algorithms", "Software algorithms", "Visualization", "Computer science education", "algorithms", "computer aided instruction", "user interfaces", ""], "arnumber": "6799216"}
