For example, these applications must be adapted to the variations of each teaching-learning process. Thus, they must be changed manually, according to the particular environment in which they will be deployed. This manual adaptation process is costly and error-prone. Our hypothesis is that software product line (SPL) engineering, whose goal is the effective production of similar software systems, can help to alleviate this problem. This paper illustrates this idea by refactoring an e-learning application named E-Learning Web Miner in a SPL. The benefits obtained are highlighted and analyzed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "64", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "71", "date_publication": "Wed Apr 16 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "14318547", "date": "May 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri May 16 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "2", "pages": "64 - 71", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Pablo S\u00e1nchez Barreiro", "Diego Garc\u00eda-Saiz", "Marta Elena Zorrilla Pantale\u00f3n"], "keywords": ["computer aided instruction", "data mining", "SPL engineering", "e-learning Web miner", "e-learning application", "e-learning platforms", "manual adaptation process", "refactoring", "software product line", "software products", "software systems", "teaching-learning process", "Computer architecture", "Data mining", "Education courses", "Electronic learning", "HTML", "Software development", "Software systems", "Software product line", "data mining", "e-learning", "refactoring", ""], "arnumber": "6799220"}
