This paper summarizes and confronts these points of view: 1) automated approaches; 2) combination of different methodologies; 3) emphasis on human and social aspects; 4) domain-specific development approaches, 5) model-driven/language-driven development and system integration approaches, and 6) grammar-oriented development. While these points of view support different approaches to the engineering process, all of them share a common goal: to facilitate the development of complex e-Learning applications and solutions by multidisciplinary teams of software developers, instructors, domain experts, students, and final users.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "72", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "80", "date_publication": "Wed Apr 16 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "14318545", "date": "May 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri May 16 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "2", "pages": "72 - 80", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Juan Manuel Dodero", "Francisco-Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Pe\u00f1alvo", "Carina Gonz\u00e3lez", "Pablo Moreno-Ger", "Miguel-Angel Redondo", "Antonio Sarasa-Cabezuelo", "Jos\u00e9-Luis Sierra"], "keywords": ["computer aided instruction", "software maintenance", "ISELEAR", "automated approach", "domain-specific development approach", "e-learning application development", "e-learning solution development", "e-learning solution maintenance", "grammar-oriented development", "human aspects", "language-driven development", "model-driven development", "social aspects", "software development", "software engineering", "system integration approach", "Computer architecture", "Electronic learning", "Games", "Interoperability", "Software development", "Software engineering", "e-Learning", "software engineering", ""], "arnumber": "6799263"}
