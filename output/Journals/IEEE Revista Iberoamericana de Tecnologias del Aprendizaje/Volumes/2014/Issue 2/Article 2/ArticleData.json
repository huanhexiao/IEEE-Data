One important issue of these courses is that in order to learn new content, previous skills must be consolidated. Therefore, a progressive and continuous feedback is essential to increase the motivation of the students. In this paper, we present an experience that obtains this feedback by means of the on-line educational platform. The impact of this experience is evaluated in a group of students.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "49", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "56", "date_publication": "Wed Apr 16 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "14318546", "date": "May 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri May 16 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "2", "pages": "49 - 56", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Juan M.
