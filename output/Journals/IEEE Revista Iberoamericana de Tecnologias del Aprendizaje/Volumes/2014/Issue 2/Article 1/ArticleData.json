This paper is focused on students' homework, which consists in producing learning objects. The digital objects are self-contained and reusable within the course framework according to a suitable work plan and supported by digital tools. Additionally, in order to help the student on the achievement of curricula competences by producing these objects, they are also available to the whole group in the form of a digital collection of self-study material adapted to the group's characteristics. This paper describes a case of study, analyses students' perception of the activity, and quantifies the success of the experience.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "43", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "48", "date_publication": "Wed Apr 16 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "14318544", "date": "May 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri May 16 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "2", "pages": "43 - 48", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Sara Blanc", "Jos\u00e9 Vicente Benlloch-Dualde"], "keywords": ["computer aided instruction", "computer science education", "educational courses", "educational institutions", "engineering education", "further education", "computer science education", "curricula competences", "digital collection", "digital learning object production", "digital tools", "engineering courses", "engineering university courses", "group characteristics", "innovative-project research", "self-contained reusable digital objects", "self-learning promoting", "self-study material", "student experience success quantification", "student homework", "student perception analysis", "work planning", "Computer languages", "Computer networks", "Education courses", "Electronic learning", "Feedback", "Programming", "Research and development", "Software development", "Engineering", "digital learning objects", "self-centered learning", "student activities", ""], "arnumber": "6799250"}
