We present a pilot project developed by the Remote Experimentation Lab (RExLab), from the Federal University of Santa Catarina and coexecuted by the School of Basic Education Maria Garcia Pessi in Santa Catarina, Brazil. The project has the support of the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development and the mining company Vale do Rio Doce, in the framework of a Formation-Engineering program that intends to stimulate the vocational interest of basic education students for the engineering profession and for scientific and technological research. The proposed development is based on educational content that can be accessed through mobile devices and supplemented through the use of remote experiments. The integration between mobile devices, virtual learning environments, and remotely accessed experiments provides students with a new way to interact with the discipline of physics in a simple and enjoyable way, anywhere and anytime. The architecture implemented in this pilot project is entirely based on open source resources, both software and hardware, including the learning management system (Moodle), the RExMobile app, and the remote experiments developed by RExLab.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "28", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "32", "date_publication": "Wed Jan 22 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "14115644", "date": "Feb. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "1", "pages": "28 - 32", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Juarez Bento da Silva", "Willian Rochadel", "Jos\u00e9 Pedro Schardosim Sim\u00e3o", "Andr\u00e9 Vaz da Silva Fidalgo"], "keywords": ["computer aided instruction", "mobile computing", "public domain software", "Brazil", "Federal University of Santa Catarina", "Formation-Engineering program", "ICT application", "Moodle", "National Council for Scientific and Technological Development", "RExLab", "RExMobile app", "Remote Experimentation Lab", "School of Basic Education Maria Garcia Pessi", "Vale do Rio Doce", "adaptation model", "educational content", "elementary schools", "engineering profession", "learning management system", "mobile devices", "mobile remote experimentation", "open source resources", "remotely accessed experiments", "scientific research", "technological research", "virtual learning environments", "Adaptation models", "Aggregation models", "Context awareness", "Electronic learning", "Laboratories", "Mobile communication", "Mobile handsets", "HTML5", "Remote experimentation", "basic school", "mobile devices", "mobile learning", "physics courses", ""], "arnumber": "6719587"}
