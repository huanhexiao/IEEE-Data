Intelligent planning allows us to adapt learning routes (i.e., sequences of learning objects), thus highly improving the personalization of contents, the pedagogical requirements, and specific necessities of each student. This paper presents a general and effective approach to extract metadata information from the e-learning contents, a form of reusable learning objects, to generate a planning domain in a simple, automated way. Such a domain is used by an intelligent planner that provides an integrated recommendation system, which adapts, stores, and reuses the best learning routes according to the students' profiles and course objectives. If any inconsistency happens during the route execution, e.g., the student fails to pass an assessment test, which prevents him/her from continuing the natural course of the route, the system adapts and/or repairs the course to meet the new objectives.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "7", "date_publication": "Tue Jan 21 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "14115649", "date": "Feb. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "1", "pages": "1 - 7", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Antonio Garrido", "Lluvia Morales"], "keywords": ["educational courses", "learning management systems", "meta data", "planning (artificial intelligence)", "recommender systems", "content personalization", "course objectives", "curriculum generation", "e-learning", "electronic learning", "integrated recommendation system", "intelligent planner", "intelligent planning", "learning routes", "metadata extraction", "pedagogical requirements", "reusable learning objects", "route execution", "student necessities", "student preference", "student profiles", "Data mining", "Education courses", "Electronic learning", "Least squares approximations", "Maintenance engineering", "Metadata", "Recommender systems", "Educational technology", "computer aided instruction", "content personalization", "courseware", "electronic learning", ""], "arnumber": "6718016"}
