However, currently, there are no national or international standards for DEM quality assessment. This deficiency limits not only the effectiveness of the certification systems to assess the e-learning quality of an educational institution, but also the creation, use, reuse, and appraisal of DEMs. This paper presents a project of AENOR (Spanish Association for Standardisation and Certification) for the development of a DEM quality standard and the project's first results.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "151", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "158", "date_publication": "Wed Oct 29 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "14824319", "date": "Nov. 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Dec 12 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "4", "pages": "151 - 158", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Ana M.
