This methodology is based on online short-answer exam questions related to the concepts studied in each session. After analyzing the academic results of a large group of students, we may conclude that this way of evaluating knowledge is precise. The obtained grades neither underestimate nor overestimate the student's work, being similar to the ones achieved in a final exam. Moreover, there is continuous feedback, which allows the teacher to go into detail about those aspects of the subject that students have not understood.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "122", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "130", "date_publication": "Thu Oct 16 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "14824321", "date": "Nov. 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Dec 12 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "4", "pages": "122 - 130", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Inmaculada Pardines", "Marcos Sanchez-Elez", "Daniel A.
