A free software package [automultiple choice (AMC)] and low-cost software (GEXCAT) has been tested on the evaluation of several groups of UPM students. This paper is the beginning of a UPM educational innovation project. As a result of the experience, both softwares are analyzed to develop in the future a new GEECA version, including optical mark recognition for classroom evaluations. The updates made to GEECA 2013 are presented and the adaptation of GEECA to work with AMC and GEXCAT.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "133", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "138", "date_publication": "Thu Oct 16 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "14824323", "date": "Nov. 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Dec 12 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "4", "pages": "133 - 138", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 Luis P\u00e9rez-Benedito", "Enrique Querol Arag\u00f3n", "Juan Alonso Alriols", "Ljiljana Medic"], "keywords": ["computer aided instruction", "software packages", "AMC", "GEECA version", "GEXCAT", "UPM educational innovation project", "UPM students", "automultiple choice", "classroom evaluations", "free software package", "low-cost software", "optical mark recognition", "professor time management", "student continuous assessment", "Education", "Learning systems", "Optical mark recognition", "Performance evaluation", "Quality assessment", "Learning Goals", "Optical Mark Recognition", "Student Continuous Assessment", "Student Evaluation", "Student evaluation", "learning goals", "optical mark recognition", "student continuous assessment", ""], "arnumber": "6926761"}
