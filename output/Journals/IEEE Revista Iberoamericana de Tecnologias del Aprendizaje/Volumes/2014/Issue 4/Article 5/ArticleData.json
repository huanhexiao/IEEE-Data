This paper presents the perceptions of 127 teachers who teach educational robotics (ER) in Latin America and Spain at several preuniversity education levels. The studied dimensions were: 1) teacher profile; 2) technological resources; 3) learning activities; 4) environmental characteristics; and 5) learning outcomes. The analysis suggests that learning outcomes in ER activities are related to attributes of the learning environment and the pedagogical approach.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "144", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "150", "date_publication": "Thu Oct 16 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "14824320", "date": "Nov. 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Dec 12 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "4", "pages": "144 - 150", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Kathia Pitt\u00ed Pati\u00f1o", "Bel\u00e9n Curto Diego", "Vidal Moreno Rodilla", "Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Rodrguez Conde", "Jes\u00fas Fernando Rodr\u00edguez-Arag\u00f3n"], "keywords": ["educational robots", "ER", "Latin America", "Spain", "after-school programs", "educational robotics", "environmental characteristics", "learning activities", "learning outcomes", "learning tool", "ordinary school", "pedagogical approach", "teacher profile", "technological resources", "Educational institutions", "Europe", "Latin America", "Learning systems", "Programming", "Robots", "Educational robotics", "educational robotic platforms", "learning environment", "learning outcomes", "learning tool", "pedagogical approach", "programming software", "robotics", ""], "arnumber": "6926735"}
