A new approach to make the recommendations is added to the system: the reputation of the candidate users in the community. The reputation is calculated on the basis of past interactions, more precisely the satisfaction of the user who made the question. Results show that the recommendations based on reputation, knowledge, and availability of users are more accurate.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "Mon Jan 18 00:00:00 EST 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "15837463", "date": "Feb. 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 08 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "18 - 22", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Silvana V.
