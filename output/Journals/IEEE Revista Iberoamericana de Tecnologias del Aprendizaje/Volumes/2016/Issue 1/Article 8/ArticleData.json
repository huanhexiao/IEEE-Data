In this context, a teaching-learning process will be developed that is linked to urban heritage, determining the educational effectiveness with these tools. The methodological research focuses on two dimensions: 1) technological design of a mobile learning platform and 2) determining educational modes of understanding of the program. A patrimonial thematic unit will result from this design whose significance in mLearning-uLearning processes will be determined, considering the elements of identity and local culture.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "41", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "46", "date_publication": "Mon Jan 18 00:00:00 EST 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "15837462", "date": "Feb. 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 08 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "41 - 46", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Jorge Joo Nagata", "Jos\u00e9 Rafael Garc\u00eda-Bermejo Giner", "Fernando Mart\u00ednez Abad"], "keywords": ["augmented reality", "computer aided instruction", "mobile learning", "navigation", "pedestrians", "augmented reality", "educational resources", "mLearning-uLearning process", "mobile devices", "mobile learning platform", "mobile pedestrian navigation", "teaching-learning process", "territory", "urban heritage", "virtual heritage", "Context", "Data visualization", "Education", "Mobile communication", "Navigation", "Software", "Urban areas", "Augmented reality", "Computer-aided instruction", "Mobile computing", "Navigation", "computer-aided instruction", "mobile computing", "navigation", ""], "arnumber": "7384430"}
