This robot competition takes place in an emulated factory plant, where automatic guided vehicles (AGVs) must cooperate to perform tasks. To accomplish their goals, the AGVs must deal with localization, navigation, scheduling, and cooperation problems that must be solved autonomously. This robot competition can play an important role in education due to its inherent multidisciplinary approach, which can motivate students to bridge different technological areas. It can also play an important role in research and development, because it is expected that its outcomes will later be transferred to real-world problems in manufacturing or service robots. By presenting a scaled-down factory shop floor, this competition creates a benchmark that can be used to compare different approaches to the challenges that arise in this kind of environment. The ability to alter the environment, in some restricted areas, can usually promote the test and evaluation of different localization mechanisms, which is not possible in other competitions. This paper presents one of the possible approaches to build a robot capable of entering this competition. It can be used as a reference to current and new teams.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "9", "date_publication": "Thu Jan 14 00:00:00 EST 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "15837468", "date": "Feb. 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 08 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "1 - 9", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Paulo Jos\u00e9 Costa", "Nuno Moreira", "Daniel Campos", "Jos\u00e9 Gon\u00e7alves", "Jos\u00e9 Lima", "Pedro Lu\u00eds Costa"], "keywords": ["SLAM (robots)", "automatic guided vehicles", "industrial robots", "mobile robots", "multi-robot systems", "navigation", "scheduling", "trajectory control", "AGV cooperation", "Portuguese Robotics Competition", "Robot@Factory competition", "Robotica", "automatic guided vehicles", "cooperation problem", "education", "emulated factory plant", "localization mechanism", "manufacturing robots", "navigation", "omnidirectional mobile robot", "robot trajectory", "scaled-down factory shop floor", "scheduling", "service robots", "student motivation", "DC motors", "Mathematical model", "Mobile robots", "Navigation", "Robot sensing systems", "Wheels", "Education", "Localization", "Robotics", "education", "localization", "navigation", "prototyping", ""], "arnumber": "7383260"}
