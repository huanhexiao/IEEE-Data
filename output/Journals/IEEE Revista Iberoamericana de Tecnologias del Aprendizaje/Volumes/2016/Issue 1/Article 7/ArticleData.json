The aim is to understand the tendencies and needs in the m-learning field. The results demonstrate that research in the area has grown significantly since 2013, and we identify a necessity when we see that not all the m-learning applications have used usability tests; we also did not find guidelines or frameworks to evaluate them. With these results and tendencies, we propose an evaluation framework for m-learning applications, considering pedagogical usability and user interface usability, to improve the quality of m-learning applications.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "33", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "40", "date_publication": "Mon Jan 18 00:00:00 EST 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "15837467", "date": "Feb. 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 08 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "33 - 40", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Christian X.
