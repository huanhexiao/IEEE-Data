This complexity means to reorganize these systems as a set of components that may offer services, interact, and evolve in very different ways, including capabilities such as adaptation and intelligent behaviors. In addition, the users should be considered an important component of these so-called technological ecosystems. The Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality (TEEM) Conference is an event that studies the most significant advances in this research area, in which the engineering approach is always a key factor. From the last edition of this event, TEEM 2014, that was held in the University of Salamanca in October 1-3, 2014, seven papers were selected, which have been extended and reviewed again. Three of these papers were finally accepted for publication in the VAEP-RITA/IEEE RITA journal.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "32", "date_publication": "Mon Jan 18 00:00:00 EST 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "15837466", "date": "Feb. 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 08 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "31 - 32", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Francisco Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Pe\u00f1alvo"], "keywords": ["knowledge management", "technology management", "adaptation behavior", "complex technological systems", "intelligent behavior", "knowledge society", "technological ecosystems", "Computers", "Ecosystems", "Electronic learning", "Interoperability", "Knowledge management", "Technological innovation", "Engineering", "Knowledge Society", "TEEM", "Technological Ecosystems", "engineering", "knowledge society", "technological ecosystems", ""], "arnumber": "7384618"}
