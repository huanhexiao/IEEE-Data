Therefore, any resource that involves an improvement in their practical training is an issue of interest to the academia. eLab3D is an electronics remote laboratory based on a configurable hardware and 3-D virtual world, that allows students to carry out real experiments with analog electronic circuits. This paper provides a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities Threats analysis of remote laboratories compiled from recent publications and presents some relevant results of the use of eLab3D in real educational contexts, the teachers' assessment of its potential and the students' perceived satisfaction.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "160", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "167", "date_publication": "Mon Aug 24 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "15553501", "date": "Aug. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 26 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "160 - 167", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Sergio L\u00f3pez", "Antonio Carpe\u00f1o", "Jes\u00fas Arriaga"], "keywords": ["computer aided instruction", "electronic engineering computing", "electronic engineering education", "teaching", "virtual instrumentation", "virtual reality", "3D virtual world", "analog electronic circuit", "complementary resource", "configurable hardware", "eLab3D", "electronics remote laboratory", "engineering education", "experimental training", "student perceived satisfaction", "teacher assessment", "Instruments", "Remote laboratories", "Software", "Three-dimensional displays", "Training", "Remote laboratory", "Remote laboratory,", "eLearning", "electronic experiments", "engineering education", "virtual worlds", ""], "arnumber": "7219409"}
