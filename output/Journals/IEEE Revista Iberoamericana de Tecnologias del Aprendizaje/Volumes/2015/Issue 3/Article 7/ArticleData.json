In the first approach, a new European and interinstitutional online master's degree program was developed and prepared among five different institutions from four different European countries via an online-distributed platform. The program is offered online across five European institutions and is oriented to labor market needs for qualified graduates. In the second approach, a massive open online course was developed and openly delivered to the public. It is devoted uniquely to acquiring practical competences by building and experimenting with electronic circuits online. In both of them, ICTs are intensively adopted in order to deliver theoretical contents to students anywhere and anytime without geographical or time constraints. Similarly, remotely accessed laboratories are adopted in order to allow online experimentation. The development and implementation of both approaches are discussed in this paper. Experiences, comments, and conclusions are provided.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "126", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "133", "date_publication": "Fri Jul 10 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "15553503", "date": "Aug. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 26 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "126 - 133", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Manuel Castro", "Mohamed Tawfik", "Edmundo Tovar"], "keywords": ["Internet", "computer aided instruction", "educational courses", "educational institutions", "engineering education", "globalisation", "ICT", "digitalization", "educational institution", "engineering education", "globalization", "information and communication technology", "massive open online course", "online master degree program", "online-distributed platform", "remote practical competency", "Electronic learning", "Europe", "Remote laboratories", "Solid modeling", "Training", "Computer-Aided Engineering", "MOOC", "RIPLECS", "Remote laboratories", "Technology-Enhanced Learning", "Technology-enhanced learning", "computer-aided engineering", "inter-institutional online master", "remote laboratories", ""], "arnumber": "7154419"}
