Otherwise, they will have additional difficulties in their daily life activities and hence their social inclusion. It is a big challenge for parents and teachers, but it is easier if the process begins since childhood. In this paper, we present Tic@ula, a virtual repository for creating, centralizing, and sharing learning objects based on the IEEE learning object metadata standard. The framework aims to enhance the adaptation of the resources for literacy to the Costa Rican reality and extend its application to children with moderate intellectual disability. The educational resources are based on the literacy method proposed by Spanish authors in their book Down Syndrome: Reading and Writing. The method and the resources were evaluated in a case study. The preliminary results showed that the method cannot only be applied in local context but also assists teachers and parents in the design and use of literacy resources for special education.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "168", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "174", "date_publication": "Mon Jul 13 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "15553496", "date": "Aug. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 26 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "168 - 174", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Janio Jad\u00e1n-Guerrero", "Luis A.
