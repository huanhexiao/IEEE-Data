The experimental apparatus is similar to that used by Joseph John Thomson in 1897, which resulted in the discovery of the electron. The remote experiment can be accessed online from a personal computer or from a mobile device under Android operating system. Results of an experimental and remote determination of the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron are presented as well as an analysis of the VLE usability.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "186", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "194", "date_publication": "Fri Jul 10 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "15553497", "date": "Aug. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 26 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "186 - 194", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Eduardo Kojy Takahashi", "Dayane Carvalho Cardoso", "Hermes Gustavo Fernandes Neri", "Rener Martins Moura", "Rubens Gedraite", "Adilmar Coelho Dantas", "Maycon Junio Pereira Pacheco", "Pedro Henrique Borges"], "keywords": ["computer aided instruction", "educational courses", "physics computing", "Android operating system", "VLE", "electron discovery", "virtual learning environment", "Acceleration", "Coils", "Education", "Electronic mail", "Potentiometers", "Power supplies", "High school education", "WebLab", "high school education", "open laboratory", "remote experiment", "scientific education", "virtual learning environment", ""], "arnumber": "7154437"}
