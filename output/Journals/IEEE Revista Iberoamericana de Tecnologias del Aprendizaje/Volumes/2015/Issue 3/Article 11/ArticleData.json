Incorporating robotics in programming children can help to learn in a concrete and funny way, collaborating with each other. The research project presented in this paper describes the first prototype that implements a programming environment for robots using mobile devices, for children in early childhood-4 to 6 years old. This prototype is fully functional and allows Bluetooth communication one by one. We expect that our research will contribute to human-computer interface field, providing a new nontraditional interface to support the learning process of programming in preschoolers.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "152", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "159", "date_publication": "Mon Jul 13 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "15553495", "date": "Aug. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 26 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "152 - 159", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Kryscia Ram\u00edrez-Benavides", "Luis A.
