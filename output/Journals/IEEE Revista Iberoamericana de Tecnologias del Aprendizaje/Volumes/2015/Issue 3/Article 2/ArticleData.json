However, ubiquitous learning approaches are not at a full level of maturity, much of these approaches lacking proposals aiming to provide its practical use. This paper presents an architecture for ubiquitous learning, which employs the paradigm of ontology-based data access (OBDA) for solving problems related to data integration and access of data sources in complex structures. OBDA techniques are explored to allow access and mapping of contextual data and their integration into a student's context-aware semantic model. The applicability of this proposal is evaluated through a case study with an e-learning environment and a middleware for ubiquitous computing.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "92", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "99", "date_publication": "Fri Jul 10 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "15553498", "date": "Aug. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 26 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "92 - 99", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Ana Marilza Pernas", "Isabela Gasparini", "Lucas Vaz Pires", "Jo\u00e3o Ladislau Barbar\u00e1 Lopes", "Adenauer Corr\u00eaa Yamin", "Jos\u00e9 Palazzo M. de Oliveira"], "keywords": ["computer aided instruction", "mobile learning", "ontologies (artificial intelligence)", "OBDA technique", "context-aware semantic model", "e-learning", "integrated infrastructure", "middleware", "mobile learning", "ontology-based data access", "problem solving", "ubiquitous learning", "Adaptation models", "Context", "Context modeling", "Middleware", "Ontologies", "Semantics", "Ubiquitous computing", "Context Awareness", "Context awareness", "Distance Learning", "Ontology-Based Data Access", "Ubiquitous Computing", "distance learning", "ontology-based data access", "ubiquitous computing", ""], "arnumber": "7154450"}
