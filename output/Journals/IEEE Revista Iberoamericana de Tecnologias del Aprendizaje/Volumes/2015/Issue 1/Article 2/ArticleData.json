Even if they are not hosted in a centralized course management system, they are usually highly coupled. In this paper, we show how semantic technologies can help decoupling them. We build an e-learning web ecosystem enriched with an educational information according to an educational information model and a domain-specific model, so we provide teachers and students with a common user interface. We implemented our proposal in the ASCETA project, integrating well-known open-source systems, such as wikis, blogs, microblogging services, content management systems, and task management systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Tue Jan 27 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "14948570", "date": "Feb. 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 27 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "11 - 16", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Juan Manuel Dodero", "Manuel Palomo-Duarte", "Iv\u00e1n Ruiz-Rube", "Ignacio Traverso", "Jos\u00e9 Miguel Mota", "Antonio Balderas"], "keywords": ["Web services", "Web sites", "computer aided instruction", "content management", "semantic Web", "ASCETA project", "Web services", "blogs", "centralized course management system", "content management system", "digital ecosystem", "domain-specific model", "e-learning Web ecosystem", "educational information model", "learning resource semantic integration", "learning technologies", "microblogging services", "open-source system", "semantic technologies", "students", "task management system", "teachers", "user interface", "virtual learning environment", "wikis", "Ecosystems", "Information services", "Semantics", "Twitter", "Virtual learning", "Vocabulary", "Web services", "Semantic web", "virtual learning environments", "web services", ""], "arnumber": "7024133"}
