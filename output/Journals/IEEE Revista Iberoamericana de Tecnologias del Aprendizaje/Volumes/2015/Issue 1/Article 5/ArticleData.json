The main result of this paper is that there is an increasing number of courses that rely on virtual classrooms, but learning occurs both in and out of these learning environments. This paper is the starting point for future research on the relevance, impact, and effectiveness of incorporating learning management systems in university teaching, as well as on relations and possibilities of integration between them, personal learning environments, and mobile learning trends.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "26", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "32", "date_publication": "Tue Jan 27 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "14948568", "date": "Feb. 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 27 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "26 - 32", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Patricio Ricardo Humanante-Ramos", "Francisco Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Pe\u00f1alvo", "Miguel \u00c1ngel Conde-Gonz\u00e1lez"], "keywords": ["educational courses", "educational institutions", "further education", "learning management systems", "mobile learning", "teaching", "National University of Chimborazo-Ecuador", "learning management systems", "mobile learning", "online classrooms", "student personal learning environments", "university students", "university teaching", "virtual classrooms", "Context modeling", "Electronic mail", "Informatics", "Learning systems", "Least squares approximations", "Web 2.0", "Higher Education", "Information and Communication Technology", "Learning Management Systems", "Personal Learning Environments", "Virtual Classrooms", "eLearning", "higher education", "information and communication technology", "learning management systems", "personal learning environments", "virtual classrooms", ""], "arnumber": "7024138"}
