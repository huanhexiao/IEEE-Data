On the one hand, we present an experience of a Masters' level course based on real-world projects with interaction with real developers from industry. This reality check created a special motivation for students as well as provided a useful experience for their future work. On the other hand, we describe the technical details of the three projects carried out by the students. These were extensions to Google's massive open online course platform Course Builder. They were about an improvement in the management of quizzes, an extension with learning analytics tools, and an integration with Mozilla open badges.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "3", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "Tue Jan 27 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "14948572", "date": "Feb. 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 27 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "3 - 10", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Carlos Delgado Kloos", "Pedro J.
