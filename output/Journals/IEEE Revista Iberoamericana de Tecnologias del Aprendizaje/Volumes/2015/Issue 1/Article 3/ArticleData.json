This Ph.D. program and the TEEM conference present an interdisciplinary and multicultural approach to the challenges and solutions of problems in the knowledge society. Engineering, more specifically, software and computer engineering, plays a very outstanding role in this conference and Ph.D. program. We want to thank the IEEE REVISTA IBEROAMERICANA DE TECNOLOGIAS DEL APRENDIZAJE with for its support to this project and the opportunity to select a couple of papers from the TEEM conference to be extended in this issue.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "Tue Jan 27 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "14948569", "date": "Feb. 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 27 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "17 - 18", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Francisco Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda-Pe\u00f1alvo"], "keywords": ["educational courses", "educational institutions", "societies", "PhD programme", "TEEM conference", "education", "engineering contribution", "knowledge society", "technological ecosystems for enhancing multiculturality", "Cultural differences", "Ecosystems", "Education courses", "Electronic learning", "Engineering education", "Knowledge engineering", "Robots", "Engineering", "Interdisciplinary", "Knowledge Society", "Multiculturality", "PhD Programme", "PhD programme", "TEEM Conference", "TEEM conference", "interdisciplinary", "knowledge society", "multiculturality", ""], "arnumber": "7024125"}
