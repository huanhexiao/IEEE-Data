It describes the experience of using robots in a course on computer architecture of the Computer Engineering program at the Universidad de Leo\u0301n (Spain). It also states that including competitions contribute to students' engagement. Finally, we show how the use of natural and unpredictable elements (living animals) in the environment makes these competitions more challenging. Preliminary analysis of this experience is also discussed based on a group of 67 students. We assessed the students' attendance, their final marks, and also the subjective impression about lectures through ad hoc questionnaires.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "Tue Jan 27 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "14948571", "date": "Feb. 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 27 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "19 - 25", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Juan Felipe Garc\u00eda Sierra", "Francisco Javier Rodr\u00edguez Lera", "Camino Fern\u00e1ndez Llamas", "Vicente Matell\u00e1n Olivera"], "keywords": ["computer aided instruction", "computer science education", "educational courses", "educational robots", "ICT course", "computer engineering program", "information and communication technology", "living animals", "robots", "student attendance", "student engagement", "subjective impression", "Animals", "Education courses", "Educational robots", "Information technology", "Programming profession", "Robot sensing systems", "Computer science education", "robotics", "student experiments", ""], "arnumber": "7024158"}
