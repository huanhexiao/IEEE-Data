In addition to this, the creation and publication of utilities as services (being infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, or software as a service) have been a hot topic in recent years. This paper describes how the adaptation of real scientific laboratories based on OpenSocial has been performed in order to create laboratories as a service, which allow lecturers to create versatile scenarios depending on the learning/teaching process. This is possible due to its deconstruction, which can be seen as a set of services located in a specific Web container.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "69", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "76", "date_publication": "Wed Apr 01 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "15222079", "date": "May 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jun 04 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "2", "pages": "69 - 76", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Llanos Tobarra", "Salvador Ros", "Roberto Hern\u00e1ndez", "Alejandro Marcos-Barreiro", "Antonio Robles-G\u00f3mez", "Agust\u00edn C.
