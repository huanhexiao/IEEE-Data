In a previous work, we carried out and tested a collaborative instructional framework (CIF) based on pedagogical goals of the analysis level of Bloom's taxonomy named CIF. Besides, we developed a collaborative tool that supports CIF named mobile collaborative argument support (MoCAS). We conducted experiments in the classroom with students and teachers using CIF and MoCAS and we realized that CIF needed to be improved. Our research goal presented in this paper is to improve CIF to make it support interoperability and portability using educational standards in a learning management systems. Therefore, we present the CIF modeled with intelligent manufacturing system standards using the reload learning design and Moodle tools.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "43", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "50", "date_publication": "Wed Apr 15 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "15222082", "date": "May 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jun 04 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "2", "pages": "43 - 50", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Luis Miguel Serrano-C\u00e1mara", "Maximiliano Paredes-Velasco", "Antonio Ahijado-S\u00e1nchez", "Jes\u00fas \u00c1ngel Vel\u00e1zquez-Iturbide"], "keywords": ["groupware", "learning management systems", "mobile computing", "CIF", "LMSs", "MoCAS", "Moodle tools", "collaborative instructional framework modeling", "collaborative learning", "educational languages", "educational modeling languages", "educational standards", "intelligent manufacturing system standards", "learning management systems", "mobile collaborative argument support", "reload learning design", "Collaboration", "Computational modeling", "Least squares approximations", "Standards", "Taxonomy", "User interfaces", "XML", "Collaborative work", "computer science education", "computer-aided instruction", ""], "arnumber": "7086321"}
