The instrument is designed on the basis of the general criteria for the heuristic evaluation proposed by Nielsen, as well as on international standards, guides, and recommendations for software quality (ISO 9241 and ISO 9126). We present the results from applying the usability evaluation instrument to Metacampus, an LMS developed by and used at the Virtual University System, University of Guadalajara.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "197", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "203", "date_publication": "Tue Oct 06 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "15587225", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 09 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "197 - 203", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Ruth Medina-Flores", "Rafael Morales-Gamboa"], "keywords": ["ISO standards", "learning management systems", "software quality", "ISO 9126", "ISO 9241", "LMS", "Metacampus", "University of Guadalajara", "Virtual University System", "learning management system", "software quality", "usability evaluation", "Electronic mail", "Instruments", "Learning management systems", "Least squares approximations", "Portfolios", "Reliability", "Usability", "Learning management system", "expert evaluation", "usability", ""], "arnumber": "7293158"}
