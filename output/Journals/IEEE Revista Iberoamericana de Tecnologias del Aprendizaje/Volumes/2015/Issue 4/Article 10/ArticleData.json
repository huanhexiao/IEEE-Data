In response to these needs, this paper provides a literature review on the commonly encountered hardware and software implementation issues nowadays. It provides a generic model for developing and implementing modern remote laboratories suited for a wide spectrum of application categories and for the next-generation educational systems. This paper addresses all the components and stages of the architectural design, outlining the critical factors to be considered in each of them. The overall goal is to provide guidelines for developers, either providers or consumers, and to facilitate remote laboratories development, implementation, and sharing across universities-seamlessly and efficiently.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "269", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "279", "date_publication": "Tue Oct 06 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "15587231", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 09 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "269 - 279", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Mohamed Tawfik", "David Lowe", "Christophe Salzmann", "Denis Gillet", "Elio Sancristobal", "Manuel Castro"], "keywords": ["computer aided engineering", "computer aided instruction", "distance learning", "educational institutions", "engineering education", "laboratories", "digital technologies", "engineering education", "hardware implementation issues", "next-generation educational systems", "remote laboratories", "software implementation issues", "universities", "Hardware", "Instruments", "MATLAB", "Relays", "Remote laboratories", "Computer-Aided Engineering", "Computer-aided engineering", "Distance Education", "Remote Laboratories", "distance education", "eLearning", "remote laboratories", ""], "arnumber": "7293130"}
