This goal has been achieved through a teaching method based on real projects that are closely related to aerospace engineering. Throughout this paper, the process of teaching electronics through two subjects, one compulsory and one elective, is described. Subsequently, a description of the major projects that have been implemented in the last years is given. The academic results have been very satisfactory, and project development has proved a widely accepted method of teaching by students.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "282", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "289", "date_publication": "Wed Oct 07 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "15587229", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 09 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "282 - 289", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Luis Gil-S\u00e1nchez", "Rafael Masot", "Miguel Alca\u00f1iz"], "keywords": ["aerospace engineering", "electronic engineering education", "teaching", "aeronautical engineering students", "aerospace engineering", "electronic engineering", "project-based learning", "teaching method", "Aerospace electronics", "Aircraft propulsion", "Education", "MATLAB", "Microcontrollers", "Vehicles", "Project-Based learning", "Project-based learning", "aerospace engineering", "electronic engineering", "electronic technology", ""], "arnumber": "7293615"}
