In this sense, this paper presents the development and the evaluation of an authoring tool taxonomy made in compliance with the ANSI/NISO Z39.19 international standard. The taxonomy was classified over 400 tools and was published on a Web site. It was evaluated by 135 professionals of distance learning communities through a questionnaire. The results showed the validity and the usefulness of the taxonomy and pointed out the pertinence of the classification strategy.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "204", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "211", "date_publication": "Tue Oct 06 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "15587222", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 09 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "204 - 211", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Andr\u00e9 Lu\u00eds Alice Raabe", "Agnaldo da Costa", "Marli F\u00e1tima Vick Vieira"], "keywords": ["ANSI standards", "authoring systems", "distance learning", "ANSI/NISO Z39.19 international standard", "authoring tool taxonomy", "digital instructional materials", "Animation", "Education", "Navigation", "Software", "Standards", "Taxonomy", "Videos", "Authoring Tools", "Digital learning materials", "Learning Objects", "Taxonomy", "authoring tools", "digital learning materials", "learning objects", ""], "arnumber": "7293131"}
