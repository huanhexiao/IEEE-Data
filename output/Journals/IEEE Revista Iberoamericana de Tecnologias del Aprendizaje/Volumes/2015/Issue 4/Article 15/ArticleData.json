The use of an appropriate learning methodology enables the development of transversal skills during this educational process. In this paper, we discuss a new experience with project-based learning involving the design and development of a low-cost robot manipulator with six degrees of freedom, to motivate undergraduate students in the Robotic Elements Course of Automation and Control Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering, of Escola de Minas at the Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto. Students carried out activities for two years, from 2012 to 2014. The key learning objectives and the project implementation tools are detailed. Evaluation results and the decrease of the dropping out of automation and control engineering show that this project was effective for students' engagement and motivation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "302", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "309", "date_publication": "Tue Oct 06 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "15587230", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 09 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "302 - 309", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 Alberto Naves Cocota", "Thiago D\u2019Angelo", "Paulo Marcos de Barros Monteiro"], "keywords": ["control engineering computing", "control engineering education", "educational courses", "educational institutions", "educational robots", "manipulators", "teaching", "Escola de Minas", "Mechanical Engineering", "Robotic Elements Course of Automation and Control Engineering", "Universidade Federal de Ouro Preto", "control engineering", "educational process", "engineering student", "learning methodology", "project-based learning experience", "robot manipulator", "robotics teacher", "teaching", "undergraduate student", "Educational robots", "Joints", "Kinematics", "Manipulators", "Servomotors", "Trajectory", "CAE", "Educational robots", "active learning", "educational robots", ""], "arnumber": "7293153"}
