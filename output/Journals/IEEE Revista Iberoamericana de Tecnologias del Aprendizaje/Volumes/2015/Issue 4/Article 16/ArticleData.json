Those experiments are part of a new setup in the VISIR oriented to master as well as experienced students and users that would like to increase their experience in industrial electronics and power components management. The development of the two experiments is explained along with the necessary configuration to the core-platform VISIR. This is preceded by a brief overview of VISIR, including its hardware and software components. Finally, the remote experimental results obtained are presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "310", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "318", "date_publication": "Tue Oct 06 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "15587234", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 09 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "310 - 318", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Mohamed Tawfik", "Santiago Monteso", "F\u00e9lix Garc\u00eda-Loro", "Pablo Losada", "Juan Antonio-Barba", "Elena Ruiz", "Elio Sancristobal", "Gabriel D\u00edaz", "Juan Peire", "Manuel Castro"], "keywords": ["DC-DC power convertors", "automatic test equipment", "electronic engineering computing", "power engineering computing", "switching convertors", "VISIR remote laboratory", "electronic circuits", "industrial electronics", "nonisolated linear regulated DC-DC converter", "nonisolated switching-regulated DC-DC converter", "power component management", "virtual instrument systems in reality", "Instruments", "Regulators", "Relays", "Remote laboratories", "Servers", "Software", "Temperature measurement", "DC/DC converter", "Remote laboratory", "VISIR", "industrial electronics", "remote experimentation", "remote laboratory", ""], "arnumber": "7293156"}
