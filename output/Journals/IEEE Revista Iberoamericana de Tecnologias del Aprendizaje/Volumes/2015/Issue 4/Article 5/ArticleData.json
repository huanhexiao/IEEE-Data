The integration of remote laboratories in learning tools (learning management systems, content management systems, or personal learning environments) has been achieved to integrate remote laboratories as part of the learning curricula. A cross-institutional initiative called gateway4labs has been created to perform this integration extensible to multiple remote laboratories in multiple learning tools. This contribution focuses on describing this initiative and, in particular, how opening it to public systems (where users do not need to be registered) produces new technical and organizational challenges due to the public availability of labs. In addition, this contribution shows integrations of systems that were not previously addressed in this initiative, such as PhET or ViSH, as well as a new approach for integrating supported laboratories in external specifications such as the smart device one through OpenSocial.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "223", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "233", "date_publication": "Tue Oct 06 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "15587220", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 09 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "223 - 233", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Pablo Ordu\u00f1a", "Danilo Garbi Zutin", "Sten Govaerts", "Irene Lequerica Zorrozua", "Philip H.
