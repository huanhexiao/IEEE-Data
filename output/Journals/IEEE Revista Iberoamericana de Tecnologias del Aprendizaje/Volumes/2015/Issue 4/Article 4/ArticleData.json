However, educators need suitable authoring tools that can be used to create reusable quizzes and to enhance existing materials with them. This paper presents an online e-Learning authoring tool for creating and integrating reusable quizzes and enhancing existing learning resources with them. The evaluation of this authoring tool showed that teachers found it useful and easy to use. A total of 246 educational resources created with the tool were evaluated, and the results were analyzed, showing that the resources that included quizzes had higher quality and that the resources that had higher quality were more likely to contain quizzes. These findings are the main contribution of this paper, and they show that educators can enhance existing learning resources by adding assessment resources if suitable authoring tools are provided. Finally, the different factors that assure the reusability of the created quizzes and resources are also exposed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "215", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "222", "date_publication": "Tue Oct 06 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "15587226", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 09 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "215 - 222", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Aldo Gordillo", "Enrique Barra", "Juan Quemada"], "keywords": ["Internet", "authoring systems", "computer aided instruction", "distance learning", "teaching", "Web-based education", "Web-based learning resources", "assessment resources", "custom quizzes", "educational resources", "online e-Learning authoring tool", "quiz reusability", "resource reusability", "reusable quiz creation", "reusable quiz integration", "teaching", "Authoring systems", "Electronic learning", "Least squares approximations", "Metadata", "Servers", "Standards", "XML", "Authoring tool", "assessment", "authoring tool", "quality", "quiz", ""], "arnumber": "7293132"}
