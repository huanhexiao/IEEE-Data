The development stages for an electronic product can be diverse: design, manufacturing, test, and many hours of engineering. However, are the different development stages of a project or an electronic product included in the teaching programs of our universities? In this paper, several proposals regarding the development stages of a project and their relationship with the curriculum in some countries are analyzed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologias del Aprendizaje", "firstpage": "290", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "295", "date_publication": "Tue Oct 06 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Education Society", "inspec": "15587221", "date": "Nov. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 09 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "290 - 295", "issn": "1932-8540"}, "authors": ["Gerardo Aranguren", "Javier Ortiz", "Jos\u00e9 Miguel Gil-Garc\u00eda"], "keywords": ["educational institutions", "electronic products", "engineering education", "further education", "teaching", "academic tour", "electronic product", "project development stages", "teaching programs", "universities", "Companies", "Consumer electronics", "Fabrication", "Production", "Training", "CDIO", "teaching methodologies", "undergraduate syllabus", ""], "arnumber": "7293157"}
