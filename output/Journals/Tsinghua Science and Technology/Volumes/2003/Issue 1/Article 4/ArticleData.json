We develop a hybrid genetic algorithm (hGA) with a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) to solve the rcPSP which is the well known NP-hard problem. This new approach is based on the design of genetic operators with FLC through initializing the serial method which is superior for a large rcPSP scale. For solving these rcPSP problems, we first demonstrate that our hGA with FLC (flc-hGA) yields better results than several heuristic procedures presented in the literature. We have revealed a fact that flc-hGA has the evolutionary behaviors of average fitness better than hGA without FLC.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "Feb. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "19 - 29"}, "authors": ["Mitsuo Gen", "KwanWoo Kim", "Genji Yamazaki"], "keywords": ["Biological cells", "Encoding", "Fuzzy logic", "Genetic algorithms", "Genetics", "Job shop scheduling", "Schedules", "fuzzy logic controller (FLC)", "hybrid genetic algorithm (hGA)", "priority rule method (PRM)", "resource-constrained project scheduling problem (rcPSP)", ""], "arnumber": "6073298"}
