In order to compare type-2 fuzzy sets, the concepts of satisfaction function for continuous fuzzy values, h-Ievel type-2 fuzzy values and strong order relation are introduced. The proposed method is an approach based on the possibility theory, and it generates a ranking sequence with the greatest possibility. Some properties of the proposed method are also analyzed.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "30", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "36", "date_publication": "Feb. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "30 - 36"}, "authors": ["Seungsoo Lee", "Kwang H.
