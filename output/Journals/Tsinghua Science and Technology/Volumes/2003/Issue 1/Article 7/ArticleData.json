The production process consists of two machine centers, one has a single machine and the other has more than one parallel machine. A greedy heuristic named least deviation algorithm is designed and its worst case performance is analyzed. Computational results are also given to show the algorithm's average performance compared with some other algorithms. The least deviation algorithm outperforms the others in most cases tested here, and it is of low computational complexity and is easy to carry out, thus it is of favorable application value.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "43", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "48", "date_publication": "Feb. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "43 - 48"}, "authors": ["Zhixin Liu", "Jinxing Xie", "Jianguo Li", "Jiefang Dong"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Computational complexity", "Heuristic algorithms", "Job shop scheduling", "Parallel machines", "Processor scheduling", "heuristic", "hybrid flowshop scheduling", "no wait", "worst case analysis", ""], "arnumber": "6073301"}
