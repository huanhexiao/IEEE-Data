Based on some assumptions on two complex fuzzy functions of type I upper (lower) semi-continuity, it is shown that their product is type I upper (lower) semi-continuous. The paper also investigates the convergence of complex fuzzy functions. In particular, sign theorem, boundedness theorem, and Cauchy's criterion for convergence are kept. In this paper the metrics introduced by Zhang Guangquan was used. This paper gives a contribution to the study of complex fuzzy functions, and extends the corresponding work of Zhang Guangquan.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "65", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "70", "date_publication": "Feb. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "65 - 70"}, "authors": ["Magassy Ousmane", "Congxin Wu"], "keywords": ["Convergence", "Electronic mail", "Measurement", "TV", "complex fuzzy semi-continuous", "function", "fuzzy complex number", "fuzzy distance", "fuzzy limit", "fuzzy number", ""], "arnumber": "6073305"}
