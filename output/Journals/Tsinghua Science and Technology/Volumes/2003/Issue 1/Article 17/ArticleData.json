However, limited useful workspace areas, the poor mobility, and design difficulties of more complex parallel manipulators have led to more interest in parallel manipulators with tess than six degrees of freedom (DoFs), Several parallel mechanisms with various numbers and types of degrees of freedom are described In this paper, which can be used in parallel kinematics machines, motion simulators, and industrial robots.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "105", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "112", "date_publication": "Feb. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "105 - 112"}, "authors": ["Xinjun Liu", "Jinsong Wang", "Tiemin Li", "Guanghong Duan"], "keywords": ["Actuators", "Couplings", "Joints", "Kinematics", "Legged locomotion", "Manipulators", "degree of freedom", "parallel kinematic machine", "parallel manipulator", "robot", ""], "arnumber": "6073311"}
