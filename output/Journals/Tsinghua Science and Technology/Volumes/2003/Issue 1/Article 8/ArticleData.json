The lifetime of a component is modeled as a fuzzy variable. Two types of replacement policies-block replacement and age replacement with fuzzy lifetimes are investigated. The theorems show that the long-run average fuzzy reward per unit time in both policies is just the expected cost per unit of time. In order to solve the proposed models, a hybrid intelligent algorithm is employed. Finally, numerical examples are provided for the sake of illustration.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "49", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "54", "date_publication": "Feb. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "49 - 54"}, "authors": ["Ruiqing Zhao", "Jinwu Gao"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Biological cells", "Computational modeling", "Laboratories", "Maintenance engineering", "Mathematical model", "Possibility theory", "fuzzy simulation", "genetic algorithm", "maintenance policy", "replacement", ""], "arnumber": "6073302"}
