This paper presents an integrated 3-D CAD/CAE system for a foundry using concurrent engineering which considers casting structure, casting type, and manufacturing properties in the CAD module to design the pouring system, the riser. the chill core and so on. A visualized solid model is developed for the casting component with the model design enhanced by CAE analysis. Heat transfer and fluid flow simulation are used to analyze the initial design. The whole product development process is analyzed using concurrent engineering methods. The application shows that the integrated system can improve the efficiency of the design and manufacturing process of die casting.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "117", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "120", "date_publication": "Feb. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "117 - 120"}, "authors": ["Jian Zhou", "Tao Jing"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Casting", "Computer aided engineering", "Concurrent engineering", "Design automation", "Filling", "Solid modeling", "casting process", "computer aided design (CAD)/computer aided engineering (CAE)", "concurrent engineering", ""], "arnumber": "6073313"}
