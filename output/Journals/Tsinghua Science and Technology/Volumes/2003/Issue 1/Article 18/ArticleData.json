The static deformation, vibration mode and natural frequency of the cantilever of the digital radiography system were calculated with the ALGOR Finite Element System to verify the strength and rigidity of the cantilever. The maximum amplitude of the cantilever vibration occurs as It starts accelerating. The predictions show good agreement with test results, indicating that the finite element model of the cantilever structure accurately models the mechanical characteristics.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "113", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "116", "date_publication": "Feb. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "113 - 116"}, "authors": ["Songling Huang", "Luming Li", "Liye Zhou", "Xincheng Xiang", "Jigang An"], "keywords": ["Detectors", "Finite element methods", "Image quality", "Inspection", "Noise", "Radiography", "Vibrations", "finite element method", "radiography system", "system performance", "vibration analysis", ""], "arnumber": "6073312"}
