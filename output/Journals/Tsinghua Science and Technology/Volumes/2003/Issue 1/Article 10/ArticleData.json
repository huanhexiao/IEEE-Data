A notion of signed fuzzy measure is introduced in this paper, and its elementary properties are briefly discussed. An analogue of Hahn decomposition theorem is established under the null-null-additive condition. A version of the Jordan decomposition theorem is proved under the null-additive condition.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "60", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "64", "date_publication": "Feb. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "60 - 64"}, "authors": ["Oiang Zhang", "Ke Liu"], "keywords": ["Additives", "Extraterrestrial measurements", "Fuzzy logic", "Fuzzy sets", "Presses", "Q measurement", "Hahn decomposition", "Jordan decomposition", "null-additivity", "null-null-additivity", "signed fuzzy measure", ""], "arnumber": "6073304"}
