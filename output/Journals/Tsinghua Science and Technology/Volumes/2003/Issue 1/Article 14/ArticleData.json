A pseudo source term was introduced into the energy equation to account for the latent heat and kinetic energy. The fluid flow in the mushy zone was calculated by defining the fluid viscosity as a function of the solid fraction in the mushy zone. Fine meshes in the solid region improve convergence and reduce Iteration time. Comparison of the fluid flow and temperature distribution with and without solidification shows that although the solid shell in the mold is thin, it stili greatly affects the flow pattern. The numerical results obtained provide detaifs of the fluid flow and solidification phenomena which can be used to optimize the nozzle structure and other process parameters in continuous casting.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "83", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "89", "date_publication": "Feb. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "83 - 89"}, "authors": ["Lijian Tan", "Houfa Shen", "Baicheng Liu"], "keywords": ["Casting", "Equations", "Fluid flow", "Mathematical model", "Slabs", "Solids", "Steel", "continuous casting", "fluid flow", "mushy zone", "numerical simulation", "solidification", "turbulence model", ""], "arnumber": "6073308"}
