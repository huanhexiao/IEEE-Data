We have further investigated the input data dependency of their genetic algorithm, i. e., the dependency on costs and density. We have found that for input problem data sets with densities greater than or equal to 3 %, our genetic algorithm is still practical both in computing time and approximation ratio.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "Feb. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "14 - 18"}, "authors": ["Kakuzo Iwamura", "Makoto Horiike", "Tomoya Sibahara"], "keywords": ["Abstracts", "Approximation methods", "Biological cells", "Educational institutions", "Genetic algorithms", "Linear programming", "Operations research", "genetic algorithm", "input data dependency", "set covering problem", ""], "arnumber": "6073297"}
