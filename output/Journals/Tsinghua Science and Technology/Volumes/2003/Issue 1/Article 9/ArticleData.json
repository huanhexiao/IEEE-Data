This research deals with flow-shop scheduling in rough environment. In this type of scheduling problem, we employ the rough sets to represent the job parameters. The job processing times are assumed to be rough variables, and the problem is to minimize the makespan. Three novel types of rough scheduling models are presented. A rough simulation-based genetic algorithm is designed to solve these models and its effectiveness is well illustrated by numerical experiments.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "55", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "59", "date_publication": "Feb. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "55 - 59"}, "authors": ["Jin Peng", "Kakuzo Iwarnura"], "keywords": ["Biological cells", "Job shop scheduling", "Optimal scheduling", "Processor scheduling", "Programming", "Rough sets", "algorithm", "flow-shop", "hybrid intelligent", "rough programming", "rough set", "rough simulation", "scheduling", ""], "arnumber": "6073303"}
