The adsorption experiments show that the negatively charged 1, 2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoglycerd (DPPG) causes obvious enrichment of TCS beneath the monol ayer, indicating electrostatic attraction between TCS and the negatively charged phospholipid. When TCS was incorporated into the DPPG mond ayer at low pH, it could not be completely squeezed out until the monol ayer collapsed. The results suggest that the electrostatic attraction and the hydrophobic force are involved in the interaction between TCS and phospholipids at different stages. These findings may be correlated with the merrbrane translocation mechanism of TCS.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "417", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "421", "date_publication": "Aug. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "417 - 421"}, "authors": ["Xue Yi", "Xia Xiaofeng", "Sui Senfang"], "keywords": ["Biomembranes", "Biotechnology", "Electrostatics", "Fluorescence", "Laboratories", "Proteins", "air-water interface", "lipid monolayer", "lipid-protein interaction", ""], "arnumber": "6075583"}
