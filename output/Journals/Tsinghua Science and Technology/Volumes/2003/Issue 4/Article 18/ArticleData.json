The tests compared the absorbance of the UV-absorbing compound, the content of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoids, and the activities of peroxidase (POX) and superox ide dismutase (SOD) in Ligularia intermedia growing at three different altitudes on Dongling Mountain in northern China. There were no significant differences between the plants growing at 1160 m and 1820m. However, all of these factors increased dramatically at 2190 m. The results indicate that the UV-resistance of the plants mainly depends on the mechanism of fil tering the radiat ion and preven ting the reactive oxygen species (ROS) damage produced by UV-B.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "481", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "486", "date_publication": "Aug. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "481 - 486"}, "authors": ["Li Xin", "Jia Shunji", "Jian Jia", "Lin Mengyi", "Li Qi'ang", "Huang Xiaochun", "Zhang Chao", "Zhang Rongqing", "Zhang Guiyou"], "keywords": ["Biochemistry", "Communities", "Compounds", "Earth", "Ethanol", "Physiology", "Pigments", "UV-B radiation", "UV-absorbing compound", "peroxidase (POX)", "photosynthetic pigment", "reactive oxygen species (ROS)", "superoxide dismutase (SOD)", ""], "arnumber": "6075595"}
