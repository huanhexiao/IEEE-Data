This study seeks to clarify the mechanism of SA induced resistance in cotton. Total RNA was extracted from low-gossypol cuitivated cotton seedlings treated with exogenous SA and subjected to fluorescent differential display-PCR (FDD-PCR). Seven cDNA fragments were selected from the total ten differential bands. Comparison with Genbank database shows that all seven cDNA sequences are newly discovered in cotton. However, they share high amino acid identity to some registered cDNAs. Among them, three of the cDNAs could be predicted to encode basic chitinase, penicillin-binding 6 b precursor and ATP-dependent DNA hel icase RecG, while the furetions of the other four cDNAs are undetermned. Dot blot analysis derronstrates that the expression of five cDNAs in cotton seedlings is induced by SA, while SA induction has a negative effect on the transcript accumulation of the other two cDNAs (E13 and E14). Since SA was previously shown to enharee the resistance to cotton wi It disease, the finding of a basic chitinase gene in cotton expressed by SA induction will provide a new insight into induced disease resistance in cotton.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "498", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "501", "date_publication": "Aug. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "498 - 501"}, "authors": ["Ji Li", "Guangrong Zhao", "Jinyuan Liu"], "keywords": ["Cotton", "DNA", "Diseases", "Fluorescence", "Immune system", "Proteins", "RNA", "cotton cDNA", "fluorescent differential display PCR (FDD-PCR)", "induced expression", "salicylic acid", ""], "arnumber": "6075598"}
