The device is designed for miniature bio-analysis systems where cell lysing is needed to obtain intracellular materials for further analysis such as DNA identification. The device lysis efficiency was evaluated using viable cell counts and microscopy. Additionally, the device efficiency was compared with that of traditional chemical cell lysis methods using standard molecular biological techniques such as agarose gels and ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy. The results indicate that efficient bacteria and cell disruption can be achieved through a low-voltage-driven and spherically focused high-frequency ultrasonic device", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "487", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "492", "date_publication": "Aug. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "487 - 492"}, "authors": ["Gang Li", "Hong Xiao", "Min Glo", "Jing Cheg"], "keywords": ["Acoustics", "Chemicals", "Electron tubes", "Microorganisms", "Microscopy", "Transducers", "Ultrasonic imaging", "cell lysis", "miniaturization", "sample pre-preparation", "spherically focused ultrasound", ""], "arnumber": "6075596"}
