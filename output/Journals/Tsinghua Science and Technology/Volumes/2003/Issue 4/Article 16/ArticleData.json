Pseudomonas cepacia 1813, Pseudomonas stutzeri 1317, Saccharomyces cerevisiae 1912, and 5 Escherichia coli strains were used to transform acetophenone to 2-phenylethand. The results show that the E. coli strains have the poorest biotransformation ability. P. stutzeri 1317 provides the best transformation ability with a transforrration rate of 30% achieved with either whole or broken P. stutzeri 1317 cells for a reaction pH of 8.2 and an initial acetophenone concentration of 2g/L. An acetophenone corcentration of 10 g/L strongly inhibits the biotransformation for a pH of 8.2. Crude alcohol dehydrogenase obtained from S. cerevisiae 1912 transforms acetophenone to 2-phenyl ethand when nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced (NADH) is added.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "471", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "475", "date_publication": "Aug. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "471 - 475"}, "authors": ["Lin Zhaoxing", "Haon Ning", "Chen Guoqiang"], "keywords": ["Biochemistry", "Chemicals", "Educational institutions", "Microorganisms", "Strain", "Substrates", "USA Councils", "2-phenylethand", "Pseudomonas stuzteri", "acetophenone", "biotransformation", ""], "arnumber": "6075593"}
