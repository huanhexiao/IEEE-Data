Using bioinformatic methods, we have performed a detailed domain search. In addition to the viral structure proteins, we have found that several putative polypeptides share sequence similarity to known domains or proteins. This study may provide a basis for future studies on the infection and replication process of this notorious virus.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "389", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "394", "date_publication": "Aug. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "389 - 394"}, "authors": ["Xin'gang Zhao", "Han Jingdong", "Ning Yuanheng", "Meng Anming", "Chen Yeguang"], "keywords": ["Bioinformatics", "Genomics", "Microorganisms", "Polymers", "Proteins", "RNA", "bioinfomatics", "genome analysis", "human coronavirus", "severe acute respiratory syndrorre (SARS)", ""], "arnumber": "6075578"}
