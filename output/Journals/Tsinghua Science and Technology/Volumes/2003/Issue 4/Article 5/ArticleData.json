Two main morphologically different kinds of cells were formed by culturing the cells in coll agen-coated 24-well plastic dishes and flasks. One type was the adherent fibrcolast-like cells, while the other was loosel clonally adherent clonally expanded round cells. Our experiments demonstrate that the adherent fibroblast-like cells possess multilineage lineage potential, including the ability to differentiate into erdotbelial-like cells and to express the meserchymal cell marker.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "412", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "416", "date_publication": "Aug. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "412 - 416"}, "authors": ["An Xiaohui", "Cal Guoping"], "keywords": ["Blood", "Bones", "Cells (biology)", "Humans", "Immune system", "In vitro", "Stem cells", "endothelial cells", "human umbilical cord blood", "mesenchymal cells", ""], "arnumber": "6075582"}
