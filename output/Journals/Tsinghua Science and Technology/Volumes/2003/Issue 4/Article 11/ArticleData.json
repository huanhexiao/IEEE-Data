A primary culture of mouse thymocytes was preincubated with LiCI (from 5 to 500\u03bcmol/L) before exposure to dexamethasone (DEX), the apoptosis inducer. With 100 \u03bcmol/L of LiCI, apoptotic cell death induced by DEX was almost completely prevented as determined by flow cytometric analysis, termnal deoxynucleotidy Itransferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and DNA laddering assay. The results show that the DEX-induced increment of caspase-3 activity in thymocytes is completely eliminated by LiCI preincubati on. The resul ts suggest that LiCI may protect Balb/c mouse thymocytes from apoptosis induced by glucocorticoid in a dose-dependent matter.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "445", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "450", "date_publication": "Aug. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "445 - 450"}, "authors": ["Tian Yanmei", "Li Pipeng", "Jiang Xiaofang", "Zhang Guiyou", "Dai Yaoren"], "keywords": ["DNA", "Immune system", "Lithium", "Mice", "Open systems", "Robustness", "Suspensions", "apoptosis", "lithium chioride", "thymocyte", ""], "arnumber": "6075588"}
