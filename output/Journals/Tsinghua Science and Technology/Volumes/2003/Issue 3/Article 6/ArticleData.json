Near-net-shape processing involves the infiltration of preshaped porous green bodies of either 211 or yttria phases by liquids containing barium cuprates and copper oxides followed by a controlled peritectic solidification. The process yields poly- and also single-crystalline superconducting objects with a shrinkage of less than half of one percent of the green bodies. The preservation of the initial structure of the green bodies results in fabrication of RE 123 in a wide variety of dimensions and complex shapes. The demonstrated products include bulk components like cylinders, single domain thick films on a variety of substrates, freestanding fabrics and open porous superconducting foams. This paper presents a comprehensive description of the infiltration processing technique and the resulting microstructures of the superconducting bodies. The advantages of this technique and practical applications of the processed superconducting structures are highlighted.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "292", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "306", "date_publication": "June 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "292 - 306"}, "authors": ["E.
