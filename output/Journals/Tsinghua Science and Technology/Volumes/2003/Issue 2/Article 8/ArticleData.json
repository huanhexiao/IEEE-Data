Tests show that the algorithm has much better performance than the generally-adopted N-best algorithm while maintaining high computational efficiency. Also the error tolerance method used to improve the robustness of the voice command understanding module further decreases the understanding error rate (UER) to 16.6% with the computational efficiency almost unchanged compared to the case without error tolerance.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "156", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "160", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "156 - 160"}, "authors": ["Junyan Chen", "Juanzi Li", "Zuoying Wang"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Robustness", "Speech", "Speech processing", "Speech recognition", "TV", "N-best paths understanding", "error tolerance", "top-down chart parsing", "voice command", "word graph expansion (WGE)", ""], "arnumber": "6074205"}
