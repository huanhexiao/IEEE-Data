Manufacturing businesses based on NAM are characterized by virtual organization, innovation, global sourcing of materials and production centered on the workforce. Therefore, NAM requires a knowledgeable, motivated workforce. This paper reviews the literature related to developing an NAM curriculum to: (1) review the progress for organizing manufacturing information, (2) study the fundamental technologies impacting NAM, including product data management (POM), enterprise resource planning (ERP), and component/supplier management (CSM), (3) present a definition of NAM and its conceptual framework, and (4) generalize the basic NAM curriculum. The NAM curriculum can be used for developing a manufacturing course.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "192", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "197", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "192 - 197"}, "authors": ["Jiehan Zhou", "Guangleng Xiong", "Heming Zhang", "Qingliang Zeng"], "keywords": ["Agile manufacturing", "Computers", "Education", "Organizations", "Technological innovation", "agile manufacturing", "integrated design", "networked agile manufacturing", "web-based integration", ""], "arnumber": "6074211"}
