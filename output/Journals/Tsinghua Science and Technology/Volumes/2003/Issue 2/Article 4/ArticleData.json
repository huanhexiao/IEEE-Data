The impedance for lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT)-based FBAR was derived using the proper boundary conditions and material parameters. A method is presented to adjust the resonant frequency based on the process and material properties. Ferroelectric-based radio-frequency filters were designed using FBARs. An accurate result is given for the filter impedance which can be used for other piezoelectric devices.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "135", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "138", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "135 - 138"}, "authors": ["Tianling Ren", "Hongjin Zhao", "Peng Cong", "Yanxiang Liu", "Jianshe Liu", "Litian Liu", "Zhijian Li"], "keywords": ["Electrodes", "Film bulk acoustic resonators", "Filtering theory", "Microwave filters", "Radio frequency", "Resonant frequency", "Resonator filters", "film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR)", "filter", "lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT)", "radio-frequency", ""], "arnumber": "6074201"}
