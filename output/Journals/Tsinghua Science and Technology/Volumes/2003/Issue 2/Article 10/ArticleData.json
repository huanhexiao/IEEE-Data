A hidden Markov model (HMM) based method was used to analyze the temporal variation and segmentation of continuous operational gestures. Furthermore, a transition HMM was used to represent the period between gestures, so the method could segment continuous gestures and eliminate non-standard gestures. The system can analyze 2 frames per second, which is sufficient for real time analysis.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "169", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "173", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "169 - 173"}, "authors": ["Gengyu Ma", "Xueyin Lin"], "keywords": ["Gesture recognition", "Hidden Markov models", "Humans", "Image color analysis", "Image segmentation", "Shape", "Skin", "gesture recognition", "hidden Markov model", "operational gesture", "transition model", ""], "arnumber": "6074207"}
