However, much work is still needed to transfer the specific workflow model to a WPDL conforming model. CIMFlow is a workflow management system developed by the National CIMS Engineering Research Center. This paper discusses the methods by which the CIMFlow model conforms to the WPDL meta-model and the differences between the WPDL meta-model and the CIMFlow model. Some improvements are proposed for the WPDL specification. Finally, the mapping and translating methods between the entities and attributes are given for the two models. The proposed methods and improvements are valuable as a reference for other mapping applications and the WPDL specification.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "139", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "144", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "139 - 144"}, "authors": ["Zhijun Zhang", "Yushun Fan"], "keywords": ["Data models", "Grammar", "Manuals", "Organizations", "Process control", "Workflow management software", "interface", "meta model", "process definition", "workflow management systems", "workflow process definition language", ""], "arnumber": "6074202"}
