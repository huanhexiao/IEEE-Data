Laser texturing process was analyzed to select the laser parameters. The surface roughness hardness and abrasion resistance were then measured and analyzed. The results show that the surface roughness is harder than the matrix, which fits for the requirements of laser texturing. The surface roughness also has good abrasion resistance. The intensity and distribution of the single pulse are the key points affecting the surface roughness profile.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "236", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "240", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "236 - 240"}, "authors": ["Yunfeng He", "Dong Du", "Ying Liu", "Bo Sui", "Lijuan Xiong"], "keywords": ["Rough surfaces", "Surface emitting lasers", "Surface resistance", "Surface roughness", "Surface texture", "Surface topography", "Surface treatment", "laser texturing", "rolling", "surface roughness profile", ""], "arnumber": "6074218"}
