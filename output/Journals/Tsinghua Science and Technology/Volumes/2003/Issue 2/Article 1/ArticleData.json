The VCO is based on an on-chip symmetrical spiral inductor and a differential varactor. The 2.5-GHz quadrature LO signals are generated using the injection-locked frequency divider (ILFD) technique. The ILFD structure is similar to the VCO structure with its wide tracking range. The design tool ASITIC was used to optimize all on-chip symmetrical inductors. The power consumption was kept low with differential LC tanks and the ILFD technique. The circuit was implemented in a 0. 18\u2212\u03bcm CMOS process. Hspice and SpectreRF simulations show the proposed circuit could generate low phase noise 5/2.5-GHz dual band LO signals with a wide tuning range. The 2.5-GHz LO signals are quadrature with almost no phase and amplitude errors. The circuit consumes less than 5. 3 mW in the tuning range with a power supply voltage of 1.5 V. The die area is only 1.0 mm \u00d7 1.0 mm.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "121", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "125", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "121 - 125"}, "authors": ["Baoyong Chi", "Bingxue Shi"], "keywords": ["CMOS integrated circuits", "Inductors", "Phase noise", "Transceivers", "Voltage-controlled oscillators", "Wireless LAN", "Yarn", "injection-locked frequency divider (ILFD)", "voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)", "wireless local area network (WLAN) transceivers", ""], "arnumber": "6074198"}
