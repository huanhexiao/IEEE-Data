A unit isosceles right triangle is used as the standard triangle for all the derivatives expressed using the triangular differential quadrature rule. Geometric transformations are introduced using basis functions to determine the weighting coefficients for the triangular differential quadrature to map an arbitrary curvilinear triangle into the standard triangle. The triangular differential quadrature method provides good accuracy and rapid convergence relative to other available exact and numerical results.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "206", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "214", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "206 - 214"}, "authors": ["Yongxia Hua", "Hongzhi Zhong"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Boundary conditions", "Equations", "Finite element methods", "Interpolation", "Jacobian matrices", "Shape", "Reissner plates", "bending", "triangular differential quadrature method", ""], "arnumber": "6074214"}
