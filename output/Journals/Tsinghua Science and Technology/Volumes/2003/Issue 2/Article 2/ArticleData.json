This paper describes a new structure for front end passband BAW filters manufactured using surface micromachining. Porous silicon is used as a thick sacrificial layer. The structure reduces the influence of the support film on the filter to improve the VLSI compatibility as well as the filter quality. The cross-talk between resonators with different frequencies can be dramatically reduced by using resonators with a self-supporting structure.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "126", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "129", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "126 - 129"}, "authors": ["Hongjin Zhao", "Tianling Ren", "Peng Cong", "Jianshe Liu", "Litian Liu", "Zhijian Li"], "keywords": ["Band pass filters", "Etching", "Films", "Micromachining", "Resonator filters", "Silicon", "bulk acoustic wave (BAW)", "filter", "porous silicon", "resonator", "surface micromachining", ""], "arnumber": "6074199"}
