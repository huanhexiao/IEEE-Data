The concept of a rough set has many applications in data mining. The approximation operators on a completely distributive lattice are studied, the rough class on a completely distributive lattice is defined and the expressional theorems of the rough class are proven. These expressional theorems are used to prove that the collection of all rough classes is an atomic completely distributive lattice.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "181", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "184", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "181 - 184"}, "authors": ["Degang Chen", "Wenxiu Zhang", "Shiji Song"], "keywords": ["Approximation methods", "Computational modeling", "Educational institutions", "Fuzzy sets", "Lattices", "Rough sets", "completely distributive lattice", "rough class", "rough sets", ""], "arnumber": "6074209"}
