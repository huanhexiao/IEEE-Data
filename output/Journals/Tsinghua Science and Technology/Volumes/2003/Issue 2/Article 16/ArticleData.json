This paper presents a new method to analyze the nonlinear aerostatic stability of cable-stayed bridges including all three components of the wind load and the geometric nonlinearity. The analysis was used to investigate the effects of the wind angle of incidence, the wind load of individual bridge elements, the sagging of cable elements, the changes of tower height and the changes of side span length on the aerostatic stability of cable-stayed bridges. The results show that the wind angle of incidence and the wind loads on the cables have an important effect on the aerostatic stability of cable-stayed bridges.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "201", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "205", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "201 - 205"}, "authors": ["Jin Cheng", "Jianjing Jiang", "Rucheng Xiao", "Haifan Xiang"], "keywords": ["Bridges", "Finite element methods", "Force", "Poles and towers", "Stability analysis", "Structural beams", "Wind speed", "aerostatic stability", "cable-stayed bridges", "geometric nonlinearity", ""], "arnumber": "6074213"}
