Various methods have been used to measure vorticity. A hot-wire/hot-film anemometer (HWA) was used here to measure the vorticity in turbulent flows. The velocity components and their partial derivatives were simultaneously measured with a new 6-sensor hot-wire (HW) probe assuming ideal yaw and pitch factors with Jorgensen's expression and Taylor's hypothesis to analyze the data. The accurate 6-sensor hot-wire probe results for the velocity field were used to determine the velocity gradients and, therefore, the vorticity vector field. The data was measured in an isothermal model of a tangentially fired furnace. The experimental results in the tangentially fired furnace agree with numerical results.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "215", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "223", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "215 - 223"}, "authors": ["Boshu He", "Yongfa Diao", "Jinyuan Xu", "Changhel Chen"], "keywords": ["Current measurement", "Equations", "Fluid flow measurement", "Probes", "Sensors", "Vectors", "Velocity measurement", "6-sensor hot-wire probe", "tangentially fired furnace", "turbulent flow", "vorticity", ""], "arnumber": "6074215"}
