For the nonconforming finite element methods, however, the work of the multi-parameter asymptotic expansions and extrapolation have seldom been found in the literature. This paper considers the solution of the biharmonic equation using Adini nonconforming finite elements and reports new results for the multi-parameter asymptotic expansions and extrapolation. The Adini nonconforming finite element solution of the biharmonic equation is shown to have a multi-parameter asymptotic error expansion and extrapolation. This expansion and a multi-parameter extrapolation technique were used to develop an accurate approximation parallel algorithm for the biharmonic equation. Finally, numerical results have verified the extrapolation theory.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "145", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "150", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "145 - 150"}, "authors": ["Ping Luo", "Aihui Zhou"], "keywords": ["Equations", "Extrapolation", "Finite element methods", "Interpolation", "Parallel algorithms", "Taylor series", "Adini nonconforming element", "domain decomposition", "error expansion", "parallel algorithm", ""], "arnumber": "6074203"}
