This paper analyzes the security of the Piveteau scheme by designing some attacks. Two improved methods to Piveteau signature scheme and Nyberg-Rueppel schemes were developed to avoid these weaknesses. Analyses of the security of the improved schemes prove that the improved methods can effectively handle the attacks proposed in this paper.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "198", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "200", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "198 - 200"}, "authors": ["Zichen Li", "Junxiang Cheng", "Yiqi Dai"], "keywords": ["Computer hacking", "Cryptography", "Digital signatures", "Polynomials", "Receivers", "cryptanalysis", "cryptography", "digital signature", "message recovery", ""], "arnumber": "6074212"}
