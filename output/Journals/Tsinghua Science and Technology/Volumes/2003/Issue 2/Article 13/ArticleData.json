In this algorithm, nonlinear explicit rate feedback control is used to ensure fast convergence and smooth equilibrium behavior. The algorithm combines explicit rate control with a deficit round robin (ORR) scheduler, which not only ensures fairness, but also avoids the implementation difficulties of explicit rate control algorithms. The algorithm has good features of fairness, fast convergence, smooth equilibrium, low queue depth, and easy implementation. It is insensitive to the loss of congestion control packets and can adapt to a wide range of link rates and network scales. It has solved the unbalanced traffic problem of spatial reuse protocol (SRP). The algorithm can be implemented on the multi-access control layer of RPR nodes to ensure fair and efficient access of the best-effort traffic.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "185", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "191", "date_publication": "April 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "185 - 191"}, "authors": ["Hongwei Kong", "Ning Ge", "Fang Ruan", "Chongxi Feng"], "keywords": ["Adaptation models", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Bandwidth", "Convergence", "Delay", "Protocols", "Transient analysis", "additive increase multiplicative decrease (AIMD)", "congestion control", "deficit round robin (ORR)", "explicit rate and queue depth feedback", "resilient packet ring (RPR)", ""], "arnumber": "6074210"}
