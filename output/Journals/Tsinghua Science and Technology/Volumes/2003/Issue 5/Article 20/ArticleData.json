The bi-spectrum model (BSM) for conducting surfaces was used to develop a scattering model for dielectric randomly rough surfaces to estimate their bistatic scattering coefficients. The model for dielectric electric rough surfaces differs from the BSM for a conducting surface by including Fresnell reflection and transmission from dielectric rough surfaces. The bistatic scattering coefficients were defined to satisfy the reciprocal theorem. Values calculated using the BSM for dielectric randomly rough surfaces compare well with those of the integral equation model (IEM) and wi th experimental data, showing that the BSM accuracy is acceptable and its range of validity is similar to that of IEM while the BSM expression is simpler than that of IEM.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "617", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "623", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "617 - 623"}, "authors": ["Ning Liu", "Zongqian Li"], "keywords": ["Dielectrics", "Filtering theory", "Frequency measurement", "Rough surfaces", "Scattering", "Sea surface", "Surface roughness", "bi-spectrum method", "bi-spectrum scattering model", "bistatic scattering coefficients", "dielectric randomly rough surface", "microwave remote sensing", "spectral domain", ""], "arnumber": "6076273"}
