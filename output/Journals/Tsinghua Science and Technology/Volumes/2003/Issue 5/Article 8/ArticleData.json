In particular, we introduce a character sum that is an analog of the classical Kloosterman sums and establish the analogous Weil-Estermann's upper bound for it. The paper also analyzes a generalized Hardy-Littlewood example for character sums, which shows that the upper bounds given here are the best possible. The analysis makes use of local bounds for the exponential sums and character sums. The basic theorems have been previously established.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "553", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "556", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "553 - 556"}, "authors": ["Jin Yang", "Zhiyong Zheng"], "keywords": ["Cost accounting", "Estimation", "Galois fields", "Polynomials", "Upper bound", "Kloosterman sums", "character sums", "exponential sums", ""], "arnumber": "6075611"}
