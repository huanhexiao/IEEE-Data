A non-overlaping domain decomposition method was constructed to obtain numerical solutions of the forward-backward heat equation. The primary advantage is that the method reduces the computation time tremendously. The convergence of the given method is established. The numerical performarce shows that the domain decomposition method is effective.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "521", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "525", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "521 - 525"}, "authors": ["Houde Han", "Dongsheng Yin"], "keywords": ["Approximation methods", "Equations", "Finite difference methods", "Finite element methods", "Heating", "Mathematical model", "Moment methods", "differerce method", "domain decomposition method", "forward-backward heat equation", ""], "arnumber": "6075605"}
