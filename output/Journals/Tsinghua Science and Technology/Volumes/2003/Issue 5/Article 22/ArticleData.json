This paper presents an algorithm for prime fields for hardware implementation. The algorithm involves only ordinary addition/ subtraction and does not need any modular operations, multiplications or divisions. All of the arithmetic operations in the algorithm can be accomplished by only one adder, so it is very suitable for fast very large scale integration (VLSI) implementation. The VLSI implementati on of the algorithm is also given with good performance and low silicon penalty.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "628", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "632", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "628 - 632"}, "authors": ["Tao Zhou", "Xingun Wu", "Guoqiang Bai", "Hongyi Chen"], "keywords": ["Adders", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Computational efficiency", "Galois fields", "Hardware", "Public key cryptography", "Very large scale integration", "Galois field", "modular inverse", "public key cryptosystem", "very large scale integration (VLSI)", ""], "arnumber": "6076275"}
