The self-equil ibrium stress field was constructed by a linear combination of several basis self-equilibri um stress fields with undeterm ned pararreters. These basis self-equili brium stress fields were expressed as elastic responses of the body to imposed permanent strains obtained using a 3-D BEM elastic-plastic increrrental analysis. The lower bound for the shakedown load was obtained from a series of nonlinear rrathematical proqramrning problems solved using the Complex method. Numerical examples verified the precision of the present method.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "593", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "597", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "593 - 597"}, "authors": ["Xiaofeng Zhang", "Gang Chen", "Yinghua Liu", "Zhangzhi Cen"], "keywords": ["Finite element methods", "Loading", "Mathematical programming", "Plastics", "Strain", "Stress", "Vectors", "Complex method", "boundary element method (BEM)", "nonlinear programming", "self-equilibrium stress", "shakedown analysis", ""], "arnumber": "6076269"}
