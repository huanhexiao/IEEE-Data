This paper discusses the spectrum and the spectral radii of trees with edge weights. We derive expressions for the spectrum and the spectral radius of a weighted star, together with the boundary limits of the spectral radii for weighted paths and weighted trees. The analysis uses the theory of nonnegative matrices and applies the moving edge technique. Some simple examples of weighted paths and trees are presented to explain the results. Then, we propose some open problems in this area.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "517", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "520", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "517 - 520"}, "authors": ["Huazhong Yang", "Guanzhang Hu", "Yuan Hong"], "keywords": ["Clocks", "Educational institutions", "Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions", "Graph theory", "Power demand", "Presses", "graph eigenvalue and eigenvector", "graph spectrum and spectral radius", "weighted trees", ""], "arnumber": "6075604"}
