The dynamic properties of linear and nonlinear analytical models of hydrostatic bearings are compared in this paper. The analyses were based on the determination of the aperiodic border of transient processes with external step loads. The results show that the dynamic properties can be most effectively improved by increasing the hydrostatic bearing crosspiece width and additional pocket volume in a bearing can extend the load range for which the transient process is aperiodic, but an additional restrictor and capacitor (RC) chain must be introduced for increasing damping. The nonlinear analyses can also be used to predict typical design parameters for a hydrostatic bearing.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "582", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "585", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "582 - 585"}, "authors": ["Wei Liu", "Xiujiang Wu", "V.
