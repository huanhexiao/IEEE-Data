This wave resistance is calculated with a linearized steady potential model. To deal with the unboundedness of the physical domain in the potential flow problem, we introduce one vertical side as an artificial upstream boundary and two vertical sides as the artificial downstream boundaries. On the artificial boundaries, a sequence of high-order global artificial boundary conditions are given. Then the potential flow problem is reduced to a problem defined on a finite computational domain, which is equivalent to a variational problem. The solution of the variational problem by the finite element method gives the numerical cal approximation of the potential flow around the ship which which was used to calculate the wave resistarce. The numerical examples show the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed numerical scheme.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "526", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "532", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "526 - 532"}, "authors": ["Xin Wen", "Houde Han"], "keywords": ["Approximation methods", "Boundary conditions", "Immune system", "Marine vehicles", "Resistance", "Surface waves", "finite element method", "global artificial boundary condition", "potential flow", "ship wave", ""], "arnumber": "6075606"}
