A high-frequency battery charging circuit model was developed to describe the battery dynarnics when charging with DC current having high-frequency ripples. An IGBT circuit model, a high-frequency pulsed transformer coupling model and a silicon fast recovery diode model were also developed. Simulations were compared to laboratory measurements to verify the battery and system models. Simulation of the working states of an Fe-based nanocrystalline magnetic core used in the transformer shows that the transformer design can be optimized by adjusting the core gap and by employing an RC network. Further simulations show that the components in the output unit of the charger main circuit can also be optimized. Simulations also show that the battery dynamics including the inductance should be considered for design optimization of the HFSMC.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "586", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "592", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "586 - 592"}, "authors": ["Chenghui Cai", "Dong Du", "Jingtian Ge", "Hua Zhang", "Hualiang Peng"], "keywords": ["Batteries", "Inductance", "Insulated gate bipolar transistors", "Integrated circuit modeling", "Magnetic cores", "Magnetic hysteresis", "Saturation magnetization", "battery", "charger", "charging", "design optimization", "simulation", ""], "arnumber": "6075618"}
