As a result, the image suffers from shape distortion, variable brightness, and blurred characters. This paper describes a method based on book shape analysis to address these problems. The algorithm utilizes the relation between the distance from a line segment on the book to the flat bed and its projected length. The correction process uses edge extraction, iterative boundary point computati ons, linear image transformation, and histogram modification. Experimental resul ts show that the shape distortion and brightness variarce problems are perfectly resolved by the method.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "624", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "627", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "624 - 627"}, "authors": ["Xi Zhong Aogang", "Xinyou Li", "Zesheng Tang"], "keywords": ["Brightness", "Histograms", "Image edge detection", "Image restoration", "Image segmentation", "Shape", "Strips", "book Image", "edge extraction", "image distortion", "image processing", "shape restoration", ""], "arnumber": "6076274"}
