The problerrs were formulated as a bilevel programming model which was saved using a genetic algorithm. The results show that if the permeability in one direction is much higher than in another direction, the wells should be aligned along the high permeability direction. The analysis provides a theoretical foundation for well pattern arrangement in fractured reservoirs as well as in channel sand reservoirs.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "564", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "567", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "564 - 567"}, "authors": ["Bingyu Ji", "Yubo Lan"], "keywords": ["Arrays", "Genetic algorithms", "Mathematical model", "Permeability", "Programming", "Reservoirs", "Tensile stress", "anisotropy", "bilevel programming", "genetic algorithm", "permeability tensor", ""], "arnumber": "6075613"}
