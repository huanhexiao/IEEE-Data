However, most algorithms proposed in the literature do not effectively address the peculiarities of security and perfonnance requirements. This paper presents a chaos-based encryption algorithm called the chaotic selective encryption of compressed video (CSECV) which exploits the characteristics of the compressed video The encryption has three separate layers that can be selected according to the security needs of the application and the processing capability of the client computer. The chaotic pseudo-random sequence generator used to generate the key-sequence to randomize the inportant fields in the compressed video stream has its parameters encrypted by an asymmetric cipher and placed into the stream. The resulting stream is still a valid video stream. CSECV has significant advantages over existing algorithms for security, decryption speed, implementation flexibility, and error preservation.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "605", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "611", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "605 - 611"}, "authors": ["Chun Yuan", "Yuzhuo Zhong", "Yuwen He"], "keywords": ["Chaos", "Encryption", "Ferroelectric films", "Nonvolatile memory", "Random access memory", "Streaming media", "chaos", "chaotic encryption", "compressed video", "error preserving encryption", "security", "selective encryption", ""], "arnumber": "6076271"}
