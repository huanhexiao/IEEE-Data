The system first analyzed the music form and sentiment using many basic features of the music to seleet a basic fountain program. Then, this program is simulated with 3-D animation and modified manually to achieve the desired results. Finally, the program is transformed to a computer control program to control the musical fountain in time with the music. A prototype system for the musical fountain was also developed. It was tested with many styles of music and users were quite satisfied with its performance. By integrating various functions, the proposed computer aided design system for developing musical fountain programs greatly simplified the design of the musical fountain programs.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "612", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "616", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "612 - 616"}, "authors": ["Dan Liu", "Naiyao Zhang", "Hancheng Zhu"], "keywords": ["Animation", "Databases", "Design automation", "Digital control", "Educational institutions", "Expert systems", "Rhythm", "computer aided design (CAD)", "fuzzy expert systems", "musical fountains", "musical instrument digital interface (MIDI)", ""], "arnumber": "6076272"}
