This paper studies a class of fractals generated by cellular autorrata. The patterns produced by cellular automata give a special sequence of sets in Euclidean space. The corresponding limit set is shown to be a fractal and the dimension is independent of the choice of the finite te initial seed. As opposed to previous works, the fractal shere do not depend on the time parameter.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "557", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "563", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "557 - 563"}, "authors": ["Tianjia Ni"], "keywords": ["Automata", "Erbium", "Euclidean distance", "Fractals", "Nickel", "Polynomials", "cellular automata", "fractal", "similitide", ""], "arnumber": "6075612"}
