A modified variable step size least mean squares (LMS) algorithm was used for the controller in a variable environment that considered the vehicle's acceleration characteristics. The variable step size time-based synchronized filtered-x LMS method (SFX-TB) used an adaptive algorithm that was more efficient than the conventional filtered-x LMS algorithm. The simulation and the experimental tests show that the control trackability and stability provided by the agorithm during acceleration enable the ANC system to effectively reduce the vehicle exhaust noise.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "577", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "581", "date_publication": "Oct. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "577 - 581"}, "authors": ["Keqiang Li", "Diange Yang", "Sifa Zheng", "Xiaomin Lian", "Tanaka Takeharu"], "keywords": ["Acceleration", "Adaptation models", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Convergence", "Noise", "Noise reduction", "Vehicles", "acceleration characteristics", "active noise control", "exhaust noise", "step size", ""], "arnumber": "6075616"}
