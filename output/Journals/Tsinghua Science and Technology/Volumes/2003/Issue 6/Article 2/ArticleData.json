This paper tackles the problem from another perspective, trying to improve the individual streaming quality while not increasing the backbone traffic. Specifically, we apply a peer-paired collaborative streaming architecture that exploits the power of peer-to-peer networking and extends the peer-paired colaboration from a live broadcasting scenario to the more general on-demand streaming scenario by introducing a unique catch-up scheme. Experimental results show that the peer-paired collaboration can bring about a significant performance gain for on-demand streaming application scenarios. In addition, we propose a forward error correction based error recovery technique that can resist up to 50% packet losses regardless of whether the losses are independent or shared.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "651", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "657", "date_publication": "Dec. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "651 - 657"}, "authors": ["Changjie Guo", "Guobin Shen", "Shipeng Li", "Yuzhuo Zhong"], "keywords": ["Bandwidth", "Bit rate", "Collaboration", "Computer architecture", "Gain", "IP networks", "Servers", "Streaming media", "forward error correction (fec)", "on demand", "peer paired collaboration", ""], "arnumber": "6073222"}
