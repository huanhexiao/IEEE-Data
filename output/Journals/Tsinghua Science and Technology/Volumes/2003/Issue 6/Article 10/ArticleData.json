Two parallel methods were used to simulate mulate the complex flow field. The space decorrposition method divides vides the computational domain into several sub-ranges. Parallel discrete event simulation divides the whole task into several parts according to their functions. The results were results were corrpared with the serial simulation results and particle image velocimetry (PIV) experimental results. The results give the distribution and configuration guration of the complex vortices and illustrate the effectiveness of the parallel algorithms for numerical simulation of turbulent flows.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "697", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "701", "date_publication": "Dec. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "697 - 701"}, "authors": ["Yu Xu", "Yulin Wu"], "keywords": ["Blades", "Computational modeling", "Equations", "Machinery", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Simulation", "Parallel simulation", "hydraulic machinery", "particle image velocimetry (piv)", "turbulent flow", "vortices", ""], "arnumber": "6073230"}
