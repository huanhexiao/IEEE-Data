A hairy root line from Trichosanthes kirilowii was cultivated in flasks and in a 5-L bioreactor. The results show that a logistic equation can be used to describe the relationship between the hairy root biomass and the culture time. The medium conductivity decrease is linearly related to the biomass arrount. In the suspension culture, the hairy root growth is closely related to the nutrient consumption. The biomass to nitrate yield is 0.352g/mmol. The growth rate of the hairy root in the bioreactor is higher than that in the flasks, and after a 12-day culture its growth rate enters a high-speed period when the growth rate is 0.738 g/(Ld).", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "752", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "755", "date_publication": "Dec. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "752 - 755"}, "authors": ["Zhigang Guo", "Mingzhi Zheng", "Ruizhi Liu"], "keywords": ["Biomass", "Conductivity", "Kinetic theory", "Nitrogen", "Proteins", "Sugar", "Suspensions", "Trichosanthes kirilowii hairy root", "bioreactor", "kinetics", "nutrient consumption", ""], "arnumber": "6073240"}
