The particle collision term was derived from microscopic terms by corrparison with dilute two-phase flow but with consideration of the collisions between particles for dense two-phase flow conditions and by assuming that the particle-phase velocity distribution obeys the Maxwell equations. Appropriate terms from the dilute two-phase governing equations were combined with the dense particle coliision term to develop the governing equations for dense solid-liquid turbulent flows. The SIMPLEC algorithm and a staggered grid system were used to solve the discretized two-phase governing equations with a Reynd ds averaged turbulence model. Dense solid-l iquid turbulent two-phase flows were simulated for flow in a duct. The simulation results agree well with experirrental data.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "692", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "696", "date_publication": "Dec. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "692 - 696"}, "authors": ["Xuelin Tang", "Yu Xu", "Yulin Wu"], "keywords": ["Boltzmann equation", "Computational modeling", "Kinetic theory", "Mathematical model", "Solid modeling", "Viscosity", "Kinetic theory", "boltzmam equation", "dense solid-liquid turbulent flows", "mixed model", ""], "arnumber": "6073229"}
