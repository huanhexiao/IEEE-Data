Arnixed integer linear programming model was used to minimize the cost with data classification to check the observability of variables. This work is a starting point for designing sensor networks for general nonlinear processes based on various criteria, such as reliability and accuracy.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "738", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "743", "date_publication": "Dec. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "738 - 743"}, "authors": ["Bo Li", "Bingzhen Chen"], "keywords": ["Design methodology", "Equations", "Heat transfer", "Heating", "Jacobian matrices", "Mathematical model", "Observability", "Sensor network design", "data clasification", "nonlinear processes", ""], "arnumber": "6073237"}
