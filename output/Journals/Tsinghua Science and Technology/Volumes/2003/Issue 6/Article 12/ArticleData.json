This paper presents results of a physical model study, which indicate that the capacity of both the discharge tunnel and the power plant outlet could be impaired by sediment deposition in front of the dam after 50 years, affecting both the hydropower head and navigation. A flow training scherre based on the third-stage cofferdam for the dam construction is proposed to regulate the flow pattern and contrd deposition in the near-dam region of the reservoir. This flow training scenario can effectively reduce deposition in the physical model.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "708", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "712", "date_publication": "Dec. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "708 - 712"}, "authors": ["Xingkui Wang", "Xuejun Shao", "Danxun Li"], "keywords": ["Discharges", "Hydroelectric power generation", "Marine vehicles", "Navigation", "Reservoirs", "Rivers", "Sediments", "Three gorges project", "discharge capacities", "flow pattern", "sedimentation", ""], "arnumber": "6073232"}
