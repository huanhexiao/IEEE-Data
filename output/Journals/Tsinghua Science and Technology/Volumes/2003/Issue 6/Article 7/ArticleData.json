In the present study, the flow patterns in two model pump sumps with specially designed structures are analyzed using the particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. The data is analyzed to reveal a number of parameters including the internal flow field with velocity distribution, the streamline distribution, and the turbulent kinetic energy. The analysis certifies that a modified pump with added T-type battle below the surrp exhibits good perforrrance for real istic working conditions.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "681", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "686", "date_publication": "Dec. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "681 - 686"}, "authors": ["Kante Mansa", "Botao Zhang", "Xiaoming Li", "Yong Li", "Yulin Wu"], "keywords": ["Atmospheric measurements", "Discharges", "Floors", "Fluid flow measurement", "Kinetic energy", "Particle measurements", "Position measurement", "Particle image velocimetry (piv)", "pump suction sump", "t-type baffle", "vortices", ""], "arnumber": "6073227"}
