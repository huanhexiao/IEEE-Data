The material properties related to the crack bridging are cracking strength, tensile strength, and the stress-crack width relationship. In general, the cracking strength is lower than the tensile strength of concrete. Crack propagation is governed by the cracking strength. This paper presents a method to determine the above material parameters from a three-point bending test. In the experiment, a pre-notched beam is used. Corresponding values of load, crack mouth opening and acement, and load point displacement are simultaneously recorded. From experimentally determined load-crack mouth opening displacement curves, the above-mentioned crack bridging parameters are deduced by a numerical procedure. The method can be used to evaluate the influence of coarse aggregate and cementitious matrix strength on the stress-crack width relationship, tensile strength, and fracture energy of concrete.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "726", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "733", "date_publication": "Dec. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "726 - 733"}, "authors": ["Jun Zhang", "Qian Liu"], "keywords": ["Aggregates", "Concrete", "Force", "Mouth", "Strain", "Stress", "Stress-crack width relationship", "bending test", "cracking strength", "tensile strength", ""], "arnumber": "6073235"}
