Through RTK technology, a measurement precision of the \u00b1 1 cm range can he achieved The research equipment included a GPS receiver and a personal digital assistant as a data control and processing unit Real-tine GPS data was captured and processed to acquire various parameters, including the boat track, velocity curve, stroke rate, and stroke distance. Using this data, the quantitative information related to can training can be achieved The results are helpful for analyzing the biomechanical parameters of row techniques and for evaluating training efficiency.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "734", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "737", "date_publication": "Dec. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "734 - 737"}, "authors": ["Tongtu Hao", "Jingjun Guo"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Boats", "Global Positioning System", "Random access memory", "Satellites", "Tin", "Training", "Global positioning system real-time kinematic technology", "boat track", "stroke distance", "stroke rate", ""], "arnumber": "6073236"}
