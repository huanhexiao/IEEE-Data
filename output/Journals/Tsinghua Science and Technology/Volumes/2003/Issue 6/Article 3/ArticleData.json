Server applications usually run for years and spawn many threads, so they create and discard thousands of objects. Therefore, efficient garbage collection is especially important for those applications. This paper presents a class-based garbage collector for object-oriented programming environments that classifies objects by their types to achieve better gradual ness. Grouping objects of the sarre type into a group, with a lirnted typa-lock, a mutator cache and the lease protocol will reduce memory fragmentation, which is especially important for the efficiency of long-running server applications. This class-based collector partitions the heap space by type, which provides better concurrercy than the traditional mark-sweep collector, and its reusable garbaged object pool also reduces the object allocation overhead. This paper also discusses the impl ementation details, such as the mutator cache and the lease protocol, and techniques to achieve better accuracy.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "658", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "666", "date_publication": "Dec. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "658 - 666"}, "authors": ["Wusheng Zhang", "Qifeng Huang", "Meiming Shen", "Weimin Zheng"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Computer languages", "Object oriented programming", "Object recognition", "Operating systems", "Runtime", "Servers", "Garbage collection", "class-based object management", "lease protocol", "mutator cache", ""], "arnumber": "6073223"}
