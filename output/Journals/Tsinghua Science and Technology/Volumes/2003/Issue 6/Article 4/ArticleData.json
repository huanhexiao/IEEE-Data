The duration distribution based hidden Markov module in a speaker independent large vocabulary mandarin speech recognition system was reconstructed from the feature vectors in the front-end detection stage. The goal was to improve the performance of the existing system by corrbining new features to the baseline ne feature vector. This paper also deals with errors associated with using a pre-emphasis filter in the front end processing of the present scheme, which causes an increase in the noise energy at high frequencies above 4 kHz and in some cases degrades the recognition accuracy. The experimental results show that eliminating the pre-emphasis filters from the pre-processing stage and using NLTFD with compensated DTEO combined with Mel frequency cepstrum components give a 21. 95% reduction in the relative error rate corrpared to the conventional technique with 25 candidates used in the test.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "667", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "671", "date_publication": "Dec. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "667 - 671"}, "authors": ["Fadhil H.
