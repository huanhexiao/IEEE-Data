Because XML data corres in many forms, one of the most important technologies needed for XML applications is the ability to convert the data into visible renderings. This paper focuses on the rendering of XML/XSL documents into a readable and printable format by means of a platform-independent process that enables high-quality printing of the product. This paper introduces the core components in the data rendering engine, the X2P server and different levels of object abstraction. The design pattern and the complete formatting and representation of the XSL stylesheet into different types of output formats in the X2P server are also given. The results show that the X2P sever simultaneously constructs the formatting object tree and the area tree in a very efficient design that saves execution time and memory.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "641", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "650", "date_publication": "Dec. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "641 - 650"}, "authors": ["Peng Xu", "Wenjun Yang", "Kehong Wang"], "keywords": ["Containers", "Engines", "Java", "Rendering (computer graphics)", "Servers", "XML", "Web", "data rendering", "e-content", "java", "meta language", "pdf", "xml/xsl", ""], "arnumber": "6073221"}
