The model can also analyze flows with separation. The model was used to analyze the relative importance of various factors and was compared with laboratory measurements. The H-L modification produced much better simulations of the separation zone size with 20% better accuracy than the standard k-\u03b5 model. The H-l modification was then used to study the characteristic of junction flows and the separation zones with different discharge ratios. The simulational results show that separation zone size decreases as the discharge ratio of the upstream main channel to the downstream channel increases.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "713", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "718", "date_publication": "Dec. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "713 - 718"}, "authors": ["Rong Wu", "Zeyu Mao"], "keywords": ["Boundary conditions", "Equations", "Junctions", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Production", "Stress", "Open-channel junction", "hanjalic-launder (H-L) model", "junction flow", "k-&#x03B5", "turbulence model", ""], "arnumber": "6073233"}
