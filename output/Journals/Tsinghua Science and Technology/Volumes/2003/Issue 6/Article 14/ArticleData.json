The routing of hydrographs through a network is an important aspect of the design and analysis of urban drainage networks. Various numerical methods to analyze flow in urban drainage networks were compared and a new hybrid interpol scheme was developed which combined time-line reachback interpolation, implicit interpolation and space-line interpolation. Numerical simulations show that the improved method more accurately model s flows in urban drainage networks.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "719", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "725", "date_publication": "Dec. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "719 - 725"}, "authors": ["Yuntong She", "Zeyu Mao"], "keywords": ["Equations", "Finite difference methods", "Friction", "Interpolation", "Junctions", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Urban sewer networks", "hybrid scheme", "junction", "numerical simulation", "unsteady flow", ""], "arnumber": "6073234"}
