All of those compounds show the biological function of tocopherd while \u03b1-tocopherol exhibits the strongest. To improve its biological function, non-\u03b1-tocopherol can be successfully converted into \u03b1-tocopherol by methylation. A novel process was developed to efficiently convert non-\u03b1-tocopherol (in this case \u03b3-tocopherol) into \u03b1-tocopherol by methylolation-reduction. The conversion was confirmed by NMR-H(nuclear magnetic resonance-H) spectroscopy on the final product and the reactants. The NMR-H analysis of the material and specific product contents shows that the non-\u03b1-tocopherol methylation of mixture of all four tocopherols proceeds as expected with no intermediate materials remaining in the product.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "744", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "748", "date_publication": "Dec. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "744 - 748"}, "authors": ["Dengwen Sun", "Xuefeng Xian"], "keywords": ["Biology", "Chemicals", "Compounds", "Educational institutions", "Materials", "Spectroscopy", "Sun", "No-&#x03B1", "-tocopherol", "methylation", "nmr-h(nuclear magnetic resonance-H)", "structural analysis", ""], "arnumber": "6073238"}
