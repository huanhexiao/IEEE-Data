The characteristics of arc currents during transient faults were investigated. The current curves of transient and permanent faults are quite similar since current variation from the fault arc is much less than the voltage variation. However, the fault current details are quite different because of the arc extinguishing and reigniting. Dyadic wavelet transforms were used to identify the cur rent var iation since wavelet transform has time-frequerey localization ability. Many electric magnetic transent program (EMTP) simulations have verified the feasibility of the algorithm.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "672", "volume": "8", "lastpage": "675", "date_publication": "Dec. 2003", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2003", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "672 - 675"}, "authors": ["Youyi Li", "Xinzhou Dong", "Yuanzhang Sun"], "keywords": ["Circuit faults", "Fault currents", "Fault diagnosis", "Transient analysis", "Wavelet transforms", "Autoreclosure", "fault arcs", "high frequency current transients", "wavelet transform", ""], "arnumber": "6073225"}
