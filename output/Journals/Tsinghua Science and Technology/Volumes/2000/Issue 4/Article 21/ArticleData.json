Our study shows that (1) menadione-VK3 induces apoptosis in suspension cultures of carrot celis; (2) heat shock induces apoptosis in suspension cultures of tobacco cells; and (3) ethrel induces apoptosis in carrot protoplasts. Some important indications of apoptosis were observed including DNA laddering TUNEL-positive reaction condensation and degradation of nuclei.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "428", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "431", "date_publication": "Dec. 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "428 - 431"}, "authors": ["Changhui Yan", "Jun Zhou", "Haoming Chen", "Yaoren Dai"], "keywords": ["Cells (biology)", "Electric shock", "Heat treatment", "Heating", "apoptosis", "carrot", "culture", "ethrel", "heat shock", "menadione", "protoplasts", "suspension", "tobacco", ""], "arnumber": "6083334"}
