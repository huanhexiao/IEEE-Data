The unsteady velocity and pressure distributions as well as the hole-pressures are calculated for high frequency flow variations. The measurement errors caused by the dynamic effects indicate that considerable measurement errors may occur for high frequency flow fluctuation e. g. 2000 Hz especially when the flow around the probe head approaches separation. This work shows how numerical simulation can be used to investigate and correct for the dynamic effects.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "395", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "399", "date_publication": "Dec. 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "395 - 399"}, "authors": ["Yuhong Li", "D.
