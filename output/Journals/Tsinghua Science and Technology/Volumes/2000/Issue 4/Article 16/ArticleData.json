The emission method is a good way to measure the luminous flame temperature field. The maximum entropy method is introduced to the temperature distribution measurement of a luminous flame using the emission method. A simplified mathematical model was derived by combining the thermal radiation theory reconstruction algorithm and maximum entropy method. Suitable parameters were selected in the computing process. Good experimental results were obtained with pulverized coal flames.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "404", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "408", "date_publication": "Dec. 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "404 - 408"}, "authors": ["Minhan Wang", "Jun Chen", "Zhansong Wu"], "keywords": ["Fires", "Image reconstruction", "Power system dynamics", "Temperature distribution", "Temperature measurement", "emission method", "luminous flame", "maximum-entropy method", "temperature distribution", ""], "arnumber": "6083329"}
