A rotating and vibrating abrasive belt is used in the soft-elastic dressing method. The principle of the new dressing technique and the soft-elastic dressing equipment are presented. Factors that influence the truing efficiency truing precision and sharpening quality are carefully investigated. The grinding surface roughness after soft-elastic dressing is performed is investigated experimentally. The dressing and grinding experiments both prove that the soft-elastic dressing method has high truing efficiency high truing precision and good sharpening quality.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "414", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "418", "date_publication": "Dec. 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "414 - 418"}, "authors": ["Mingxia Ma", "Xiankui Wang", "Tao Yu", "Dan Wu", "Chengying Liu"], "keywords": ["Abrasives", "Diamond-like carbon", "Grain size", "Rough surfaces", "Surface roughness", "Diamond wheel", "Soft-elastic dressing", "Ultra-precision grinding", ""], "arnumber": "6083331"}
