It operates on a principle similar to that of a frequency synthesizer. The paper introduces the system configuration with a detailed description of its operating principle some practical design considerations are discussed with an experimental study to test the control performance of the newly designed system. The experimental result shows that the phase locked control system can regulate the speed of a DC torque motor with a precision up to 0. 0022 %.1\u03c3", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "409", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "413", "date_publication": "Dec. 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "409 - 413"}, "authors": ["Guofu Sun", "Qitai Gu", "Xuebin Liu"], "keywords": ["DC motors", "Detectors", "Low pass filters", "Phase locked loops", "Power harmonic filters", "Velocity control", "DC motor", "MC4044", "constant speed control", "phase locked loop", ""], "arnumber": "6083330"}
