From the analytic expressions and numeric calculations we see some general characteristics of the band gap structure of anisotropic photonic crystals each band separates into two branches and the two branches react to polarization sensitively. In the practical case of oblique incidence gaps move towards high frequency when the angle of incidence increases. Under some special conditions the two branches become degenerate again.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "354", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "359", "date_publication": "Dec. 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "354 - 359"}, "authors": ["Feng Wang", "Daijun Li", "Xinghua Lu", "Shiqun Li"], "keywords": ["Dielectrics", "Electric fields", "Electromagnetic scattering", "Photonic band gap", "Tensile stress", "Vectors", "anisotropic", "pbg", "photonic band gap", "photonic crystal", ""], "arnumber": "6083318"}
