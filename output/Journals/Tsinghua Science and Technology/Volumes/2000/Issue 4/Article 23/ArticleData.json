In this work the calcification of collagen in a model serum was used as a model of collagenous tissue biomaterials to study the possible calcification promotion mechanism of alkaline phosphatase. In the enzyme concentration range of 0.1\u20130.5 mg/mL the enzyme shows a direct calcification promoting effect which is independent of the hydrolysis of its phosphate containing substrates but proportional to the enzyme concentration. Potassium pyrophosphate somewhat inhibits the calcification promotion.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "436", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "438", "date_publication": "Dec. 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "436 - 438"}, "authors": ["Shu Wang", "Yandao Gong", "Xiufang Zhang", "Nanming Zhao"], "keywords": ["Biochemistry", "Biological system modeling", "Calcium", "Inhibitors", "MIMICs", "Substrates", "alkaline phosphatase", "calcification promotion effect", "collagen", ""], "arnumber": "6083336"}
