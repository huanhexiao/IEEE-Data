Because there are boundary layers in the solution of the singular perturbation problem the approximation spaces with different scale wavelets and boundary bases are chosen. In addition the computation of the inner integrals is transformed to an eigenvalue problem. Therefore a high accuracy method with reasonable computation is obtained. On the other hand there is an explicit diagonal preconditioning which makes the condition number of the stiff matrix become bounded by a constant. The error estimate of the Wavelet-Galerkin method and the analysis of the computation complexity are given. The numerical examples show that the method is feasible and effective for solving the singular perturbation problem with boundary layers numerically.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "365", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "369", "date_publication": "Dec. 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "365 - 369"}, "authors": ["Zhonqyr Huang"], "keywords": ["Approximation algorithms", "Approximation methods", "Finite element methods", "Multiresolution analysis", "Vectors", "Wavelet transforms", "boundary layer", "singular perturbation problem", "wavelet", "wavelet-Galerkin method", ""], "arnumber": "6083320"}
