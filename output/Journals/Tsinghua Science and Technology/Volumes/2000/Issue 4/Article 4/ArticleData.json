The spin is involved in such collisions by explicit spin-dependent interactions such as the spin-orbit interaction of the continuum electron \u2014 Mott scattering but also by exchange which in conjunction with the Pauli principle gives rise to observable spin exchange effects. We present results for Mn and Na atoms and experiments in which electron dichroism with chiral molecules has been studied.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "343", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "353", "date_publication": "Dec. 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "343 - 353"}, "authors": ["G.
