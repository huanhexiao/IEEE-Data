This paper presents a mathematical blood coagulation model for the extrinsic pathway. This model simulates clotting factor VIII which plays an important role in the coagulation mechanism. The mathematical model is used to study the equilibrium stability orbit structure attractors and global stability behavior with conclusions in accordance with the physiological phenomena. Moreover the results provide information about blood related illnesses which can be used for further study of the coagulation mechanism.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "360", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "364", "date_publication": "Dec. 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "360 - 364"}, "authors": ["Yun Tang", "Dazhi Meng", "Hong Wang"], "keywords": ["Biological system modeling", "Coagulation", "Cooperative systems", "Jacobian matrices", "Mathematical model", "Stability analysis", "attractor", "blood coagulation system", "feedback", "stability", ""], "arnumber": "6083319"}
