The blade geometry is parameterized and the optimization method is used to search for a blade geometry that will minimize the loss in the turbine cascade passage. The viscous flow prediction code is verified by the experimental data of cascade which is typical for a gas turbine rotor blade section. A comparative study of the blades designed by the optimization technique and the original one is presented", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "419", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "423", "date_publication": "Dec. 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "419 - 423"}, "authors": ["Mengyu Shen", "Shilei Yao", "Yuxin Ren"], "keywords": ["Blades", "Equations", "Genetic algorithms", "Optimization", "Turbines", "Genetic Algorithms", "Optimization", "Parallel methods", "Turbomachine blades", ""], "arnumber": "6083332"}
