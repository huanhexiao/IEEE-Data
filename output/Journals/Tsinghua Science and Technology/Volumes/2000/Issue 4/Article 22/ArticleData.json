Its mechanical and physical properties were also tested. The materials nerve cell affinity and peripheral nerve repair feasibility were also evaluated. In vitro cytotoxicity tests indicated that both cerebral cortex cells and endothelial cells ECs can attach to the surface and grow well. These results indicate that chitosan has the necessary properties for an artificial nerve conduit material and may be a promising candidate for the design of a bioactive biodegradable nerve conduit.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "432", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "435", "date_publication": "Dec. 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "432 - 435"}, "authors": ["Yinghui Zhong", "Jianchun Li", "Yandao Gong", "Nanming Zhao", "Xiufang Zhang"], "keywords": ["Biomembranes", "Maintenance engineering", "Mechanical factors", "Scanning electron microscopy", "Surface morphology", "biocompatibility", "chitosan", "nerve repair", ""], "arnumber": "6083335"}
