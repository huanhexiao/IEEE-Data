Based on investigation, energy consumption forecast and economic analysis of future technology options, the technology benchmark and site-specific baselines for both retrofit projects and new heating projects have been discussed. The results indicate that fuel switching from coal to natural gas can meet the additionality criteria in many cases and will be the main type of CDM project. In addition, it also proves that the technology benchmark and the case-by-case baseline setting approach are applicable for future CDM cooperation projects on heating in Beijing.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "328", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "332", "date_publication": "Sept. 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "328 - 332"}, "authors": ["Jingfei Guo", "Yuqing Ma"], "keywords": ["Benchmark testing", "Boilers", "Buildings", "Coal", "Natural gas", "baseline determination", "clean development mechanlsm", "district heating", ""], "arnumber": "6083308"}
