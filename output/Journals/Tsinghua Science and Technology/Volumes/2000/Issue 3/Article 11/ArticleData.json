Although efforts have been made to control pollution, water quality degradation has occurred in some of the important surface water supplies, aggravating the water resource shortage. At present, approximately three quarters of the city's wastewater is discharged untreated into the urban river system, resulting in serious pollution and negatively influencing the urban landscape and quality ot daily life. To counteract these measures, the city has implemented a comprehensive \u201cWater Quality Management Plan\u201d for the region, encompassing water pollution control, prevention of water body degradation, and improved water quality. The construction of municipal wastewater treatment plants is recognised as fundamental to controlling water pollution, and full secondary treatment is planned to be in place by the year 2015. Significant work is also required to expand the service area of the municipal sewage system and to upgrade and renovate the older sewer systems. The limitation on available water resources has also seen the emphasis shift to low water using industries and improved water conservation. Whilst industrial output has increased steadily over the past 10\u201315 years at around 10% per annum, industrial water usage has remained relatively constant. Part of the city's water quality management plan has been to introduce a strict discharge permit system, encouraging many industries to install on-site treatment facilities.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "298", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "305", "date_publication": "Sept. 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "298 - 305"}, "authors": ["Andy Pitt"], "keywords": ["Cities and towns", "Rivers", "Surface contamination", "Wastewater", "Water conservation", "Water pollution", "Water resources", "discharge permit system", "waste water treatment", "water quality", ""], "arnumber": "6083303"}
