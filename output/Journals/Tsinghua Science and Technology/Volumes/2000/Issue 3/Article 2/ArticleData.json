The effects of the initial pH values, initial chlorophenol concentration and adsorbent dosage on bloadsorptlon were investigated. The maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 110.5 mg/g at 100 mg/L iniiial concentration. The Freundlich and Langmui r adsorption isotherms were applied to describe the biosorption processes and the isotherm constants were evaluated.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "241", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "245", "date_publication": "Sept. 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "241 - 245"}, "authors": ["Jianlong Wang", "Nigel Horan", "Ed.
