Some European process requirements rements for sanitisation are considered in relation to the actual conditions within a composting mass where temperatures across the mass vary from 70\u00b0C to ambient. Improved mproved control methodologies for the ASP using combinations of suck and blow are discussed together with short term use of elevated core temperatures (> 70\u00b0C). The generation of Aspergillus iumiqaius during composting is considered in relation to reducing the numbers in the windrow by changing the operating regime.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "279", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "282", "date_publication": "Sept. 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "279 - 282"}, "authors": ["E.
