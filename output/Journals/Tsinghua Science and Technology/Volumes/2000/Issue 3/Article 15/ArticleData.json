Based on a thorough case study of the China-Japan Coke Dry Quenching (CDQ) project, the first approved pilot project in China under the \u201cActivities Implemented Jointly\u201d (AIJ) framework, the papernot only describes in detail the complete procedure of baseline definition of the case project, but also discusses its approach to baseline determination. Furthermore, cost-benefit analysis of GHGs mitigation is conducted according to the baseline. This empirical case study, based on real AIJ project data, will be beneficial for the development of future projects under Kyoto mechanisms such as \u201cClean Development Mechanism\u201d and \u201cJoint Implementation\u201d.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "323", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "327", "date_publication": "Sept. 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "323 - 327"}, "authors": ["Jingfei Guo", "Deshun Liu", "Yanlin Zhang"], "keywords": ["Blast furnaces", "Electricity", "Heat recovery", "Iron", "Joints", "Meteorology", "Ovens", "Joint Implementation", "baseline determination", "climate change", ""], "arnumber": "6083307"}
