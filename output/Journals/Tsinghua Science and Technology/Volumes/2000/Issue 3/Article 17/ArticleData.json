An effective and inexpensive process was selected, which uses DGB adsorption, PAC coagulation, sedimentation, sand filtration, ozone disinfection, and soil aquifer treatment. The effluent meets the recommended water quality criteria for groundwater recharge. Ozonation is effective for disinfection as well as for water quality improvement. Results showed that the total N in the SAT system remained constant thus the secondary effluent must have a low NH3-N concentration for groundwater recharge.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "333", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "337", "date_publication": "Sept. 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "333 - 337"}, "authors": ["Guichun Yun", "Xuzhou Cheng", "Xingchao Jian", "Tianbao Wu", "Yunzheng Pi"], "keywords": ["Effluents", "Filtration", "Organic compounds", "Soil", "Wastewater", "Water pollution", "Water resources", "artificial groundwater recharge", "coagulation", "municipal wastewater", "ozonation", "soil aquifer treatment", ""], "arnumber": "6083309"}
