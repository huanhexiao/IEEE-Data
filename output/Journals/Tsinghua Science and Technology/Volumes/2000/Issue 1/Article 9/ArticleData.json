Each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages. This paper presents a new technique for the numerical solution of transient incompressible free surface fluid flows, This powerful method, which is based on the concepts of \u201cBuoy positioning\u201d and \u201cBuoy relaying\u201d, successfully represents the free surface using a Lagrangian method on a Eulerian grid by directly solving the free surface evolution equation. The Eulerian finite difference forms of the full Navier Stokes equations are solved by the Successive over Relaxation (SOR) method with a set of buoys to keep track of the free surface. The capabilities of the analysis procedure are demonstrated through viscous free surface fluid flow examples. The method is simpler and more efficient than other methods especially in treating complicated free boundary configurations.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "34", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "38", "date_publication": "March 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "34 - 38"}, "authors": ["Shimin Wang", "Zhaolin Wang", "Junfeng Li"], "keywords": ["Boundary conditions", "Equations", "Fluid flow", "Fluids", "Mathematical model", "Relays", "Surface treatment", "buoy relay method", "computational fluid mechanics", "fluid flow with free surfaces", ""], "arnumber": "6083245"}
