The dynamic fracture process is simulated numerically in the DYNA3D program using the finite element method. The material's dynamic properties are described by a strain hardening viscoplastic constitution. A damage variable is introduced in the determination of the dynamic fracture criterion. Final rupture of structure is decided by a rupture strain criterion which is deduced in terms of a critical damage variable. The numerical results have been compared with theoretical solutions.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "17", "date_publication": "March 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "13 - 17"}, "authors": ["Chongyang Gao", "Huiji Shi", "Zhetilan Yao", "Xiaohua Wang", "Chunhua Bai"], "keywords": ["Explosives", "Finite element methods", "Loading", "Numerical simulation", "Plastics", "Strain", "cylindrical shells", "damage", "dynamic fracture criteria", "explosive loading", "numerical simulation", ""], "arnumber": "6083240"}
