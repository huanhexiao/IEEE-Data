The flow profiles at different Reynold s numbers and various positions from the jet exit are visualized using a sheet laser source. The jets include two types, an air jet laden with incense smoke and an air jet laden with two kinds of solid particles, glass beads and catalytic cracking beads The developments of both the large eddy structures of the round turbulent jet and the local particle dispersion in the vortex structures were recorded with a high speed movie camera. Free and excited jet conditions were tested. Analysis of the video pictures suggests a critical intrinsic frequency exists in the helical coherent structures of the air phase. In the spectral space the clockwise and counter clockwise helical structures occupy different positions Large scale structures exsit in the two phase jet. The patterns are similar to those of the air jet with the Stokes numbers in the range of 1\u20138. 32.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "105", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "108", "date_publication": "March 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "105 - 108"}, "authors": ["Quanlin Fan", "Huiqiang Zhang", "Yincheng Guo", "Xilin Wang", "Wenyi Lin"], "keywords": ["Clocks", "Fluids", "Glass", "Periodic structures", "Solids", "Strontium", "Visualization", "coherent structure", "flow visualization", "jet", "particle turbulence interaction", "two phase flow", ""], "arnumber": "6083259"}
