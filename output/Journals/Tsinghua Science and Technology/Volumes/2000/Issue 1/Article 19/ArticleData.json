The flow in the impeller is very complicated, and the 3-D viscous flow is difficult to simulate numerically. This paper presents a numerical method for simulating the now in practical commercial impellers. The predictions are compared with experimentally measured fan performance results. The predicted total pressure and emergency for two fan models, whose optimum designs were determined the this method, agree well with the measured data fur the design flow rate. The results show that the aerodynamic and noise levels for these two model are excellent. The paper also presents several new ideas about the shape of the front plate and the blade flow pattern to improve the flow in an impeller channel. The practical simulation methodology and results developed here will be very useful to the fan industry in the future.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "82", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "88", "date_publication": "March 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "82 - 88"}, "authors": ["Xiaodong Bian", "Xudong Tang", "Dongtao Huang", "Mancang Tlan", "Zhichi Zhu"], "keywords": ["Blades", "Boundary conditions", "Equations", "Fans", "Impellers", "Mathematical model", "Shape", "N-S equation", "centrifugal fan", "impeller design", "numerical simulation", "turbulent flow", ""], "arnumber": "6083255"}
