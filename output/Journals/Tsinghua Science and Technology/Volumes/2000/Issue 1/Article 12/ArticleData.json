The fundamental form of the implicit scheme is based on the LU TVD finite volume scheme with the hybrid flux splitting technique. The third order ENN scheme's numerical flux is used to calculate the inviscid terms of Navier Stokes equations. A fourth order accurate Symmetric compact difference is applied to its viscous terms. The Baldwin Lomax turbulence model is used to calculate the turbulent viscosity. Numerical experiments suggest that the proposed scheme not only has a fairly rapid convergence rate, but also can generate a highly resolved approximation to the numerical solution.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "47", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "53", "date_publication": "March 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "47 - 53"}, "authors": ["Baoguo Wang", "Yanhu Guo", "Oiusheng Liu", "Mengyu Shen"], "keywords": ["Blades", "Equations", "Mathematical model", "Rotors", "Stress", "Surface waves", "Vectors", "Euler equation", "Navier Stokes equation", "cas cade flow", "high resolution", "higher order accurate", "internal flow", "transonic flow", ""], "arnumber": "6083248"}
