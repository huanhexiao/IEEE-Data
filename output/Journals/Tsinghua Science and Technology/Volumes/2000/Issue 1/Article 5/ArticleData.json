Very accurate results can be obtained by increasing the order of the Taylor series. Furthermore, the local error can be estimated by simply comparing the solutions obtained by the proposed method with the higher order solutions. This local estimate is then used to develop an adaptive order control technique. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the performance of the present method and its adaptive procedure.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "21", "date_publication": "March 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "18 - 21"}, "authors": ["Xiaoping Zheng", "Zhetilan Yao", "Yixu Fu"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Earthquakes", "Finite element methods", "History", "Measurement uncertainty", "Taylor series", "Vectors", "adaptive procedure", "dynamic analysis", "error estimates", "hierarchical integration", ""], "arnumber": "6083241"}
