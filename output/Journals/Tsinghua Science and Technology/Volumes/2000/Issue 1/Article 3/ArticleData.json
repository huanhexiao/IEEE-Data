The boundary element method was used because it is very efficient. Two models were analyzed, one was a sheet containing randomly distributed holes while the other had normally distributed holes. The effectiveness of the existing theoretical models was investigated by comparing the computational results with the theoretical solutions.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "March 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "9 - 12"}, "authors": ["Weifeng Yuan", "Guowen Tan", "Zhenhan Yao"], "keywords": ["Boundary element methods", "Computational modeling", "Numerical models", "Solid modeling", "Young's modulus", "boundary element method", "composite", "effective elastic properties", ""], "arnumber": "6083239"}
