The pneumatic cylinder is the most important actuator in the pneumatic system This paper discusses the dynamic characteristics of a new pneumatic cylinder with a cushion ring and a special curved groove. This pneumatic cylinder can move at high speed and with low acceleration. The results of the experimental study and numerical simulation are presented. The simulation results agree well with the experimental data Some new designs of the special curved groove are completed through numerical simulation. The experimental results show that the mean velocity of the improved cylinder is much greater than that of the original cylinder.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "60", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "63", "date_publication": "March 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "60 - 63"}, "authors": ["Pengfei Hao", "Xiwen Zhang", "Xuefang Wang"], "keywords": ["Acceleration", "Dynamics", "Equations", "Mathematical model", "Numerical simulation", "Pistons", "Pressure measurement", "numerical simulation", "pneumatic cylinder", "special curve", ""], "arnumber": "6083250"}
