The discretization scheme, the weighted second upwind and central differencing (WSUC) scheme, uses weighted second order upwind and central differencing. The theoretical analysis shows that the WSUC scheme is total variation bounded and unconditionally stable for convective numerical stability. Two numerical tests show that the WSUC scheme is more accurate and has higher resolution than the first order upwind scheme, a second order upwind scheme, the SOUCUP scheme and the MSOUCUP scheme. As an example, the thermal stratification in a thermal storage tank is calculated using the WSUC scheme.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "64", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "67", "date_publication": "March 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "64 - 67"}, "authors": ["Zhaohui Yao", "Xiwe Zhang", "Pengfei Hao", "Xuefang Wang"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Equations", "Mathematical model", "Numerical stability", "Oscillators", "Storage tanks", "Thermal stability", "WSUC scheme", "boundedness", "convective stability", "low dispersion", ""], "arnumber": "6083251"}
