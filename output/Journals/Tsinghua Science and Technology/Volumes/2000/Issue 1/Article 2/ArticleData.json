An energy-absorbing layer and a cushion layer overlay the circular silo cover made of reinforced concrete. The dynamic stress analysis is performed by ABAQUS/Explicit. The mesoscopic structure of the energy absorbing layer is designed as an assembly of ductile tubes containing crushable cellular ceramics. Combined mesoscopic and macroscopic simulations indicate that the structure can enhance the survivability of a missile silo against blast waves.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "5", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "March 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "5 - 8"}, "authors": ["Xiaohu Wang", "Zhuo Zhuang", "Wei Yang"], "keywords": ["Ceramics", "Concrete", "Electron tubes", "Metals", "Shock waves", "Silicon carbide", "Stress", "ABAQUS", "blast wave", "dynamic strees analysis", "energy absorbing layer", ""], "arnumber": "6083238"}
