Some new results of the study on the factors influencing bubble content using this new method are given in this paper, including the results of the experiments in the SKIP valve system and long tube system Results indicate that the operating time, opening of the control valve, air supply pressure, mass of the load, speed ratio, and the length of the tube all affect bubble content.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "72", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "75", "date_publication": "March 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "72 - 75"}, "authors": ["Biao Han", "Rongming Tang", "Xuefang Wang", "Hongqing Xu", "Nan Li"], "keywords": ["Atmospheric measurements", "Calibration", "Damping", "Electron tubes", "Industries", "Pistons", "Valves", "air/ hydro system", "bubble content", "separator", ""], "arnumber": "6083253"}
