This method solves quasi three dimensional Navier Stokes equations by an implicit high resolution finite volume approach. A fully conservative method is designed to compute the inviscid and viscous fluxes at the interface of rotor and stator grids. Numerical results of rotor stator interactions in a transonic compressor stage are presented. The mechanism of rotor stator interactions in this compressor stage is discussed in terms of the computational results.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "76", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "81", "date_publication": "March 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "76 - 81"}, "authors": ["Yuxin Ren", "Toshinori Watarabe", "Shojiro Kaji"], "keywords": ["Blades", "Electric shock", "Equations", "Mathematical model", "Rotors", "Stators", "Velocity control", "numerical simulation", "rotor stator interaction", "unsteady flow", ""], "arnumber": "6083254"}
