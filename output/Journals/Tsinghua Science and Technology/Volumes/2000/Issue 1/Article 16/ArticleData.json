Results presented in this paper include further insight into the mechanism of bubble formation and the measurement of bubble content. The regularity of bubble transport in the system is found, with an idea for a new method for separating gas from oil. The method has been verified experimentally with favorable results.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "68", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "71", "date_publication": "March 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "68 - 71"}, "authors": ["Biao Han", "Hongqing Tang", "Xuefarg Wang", "Hongqing Xu"], "keywords": ["Calibration", "Electron tubes", "Fluids", "Particle separators", "Pistons", "Valves", "Volume measurement", "air/hydro system", "bubble content", "separator", ""], "arnumber": "6083252"}
