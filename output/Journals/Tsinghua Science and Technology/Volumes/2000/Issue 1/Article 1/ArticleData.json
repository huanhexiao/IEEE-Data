The object function of the optimization is defined as the difference between the measured frequencies and the computed frequencies of the laminated plates. The sensitivity of the structural eigenvalue with respect to the material parameters is analyzed. A numerical example is presented to show the feasibility of the scheme.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "4", "date_publication": "March 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "1 - 4"}, "authors": ["Zhenhan Yao", "Shisheng Qu"], "keywords": ["Composite materials", "Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions", "Finite element methods", "Frequency measurement", "Optimization", "Vectors", "inverse problem", "laminated plate", "material parameter identification", ""], "arnumber": "6083237"}
