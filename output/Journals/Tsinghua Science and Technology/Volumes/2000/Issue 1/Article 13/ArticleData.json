The new equations are used to simulate planar 4: 1 contraction flow of a Maxwell fluid using a third order upwind finite volume method. The numerical results compare well with the theoretical solutions and the results of other references to show the effectiveness of the numerical method. Numerical experiments suggest that the present method not only converges fairly rapidly, but can also generate a highly resolved approximation to an Oldroyd B fluid flow at a high Weissenberg number.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "54", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "59", "date_publication": "March 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "54 - 59"}, "authors": ["Baoguo Wang", "Ohenghai Sun", "Lanshui Zhao", "Zhanyin Ye"], "keywords": ["Equations", "Finite volume methods", "Fluids", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Strain", "Tensile stress", "high Weissenberg number", "numerical simulation", "upwind finite volume method", "viscoelastic fluid", ""], "arnumber": "6083249"}
