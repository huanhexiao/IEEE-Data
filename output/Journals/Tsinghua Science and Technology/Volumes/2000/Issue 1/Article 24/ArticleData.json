In this paper some formulas to enumerate the numbers of maximal outerplanar graphs by means of the compressing graph and group theory method are given first. Then the relationships between Catalan numbers and the numbers of labeled and unlabeled maximal outerplanar graphs are presented. The computed results verified these formulas.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "109", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "114", "date_publication": "March 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "109 - 114"}, "authors": ["Guanzhang Hu"], "keywords": ["Educational institutions", "Face", "Finite element methods", "Graph theory", "Indexes", "Orbits", "Reflection", "Burnside Lemma", "Catalan an number", "enumeration formula", "graph compression and group theory method", "maximal outerplanar graph", ""], "arnumber": "6083260"}
