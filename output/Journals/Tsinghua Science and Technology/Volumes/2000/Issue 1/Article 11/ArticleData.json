The main difference from the standard lattice Boltzmann model is that the particle velocities are no longer constant, but vary with the mean velocity and internal energy. The adaptive nature of the particle velocities permits the mean flow to have a high Much number. The introduction of a particle potential energy makes the model suitable for a perfect gas with arbitrary specific heat ratio. The Navier Stokes (N S) equations are derived by the Chapman Enskog method from the BGK Boltzmann equation. Two kinds of simulations have been carried out on the hexagonal lattice to test the proposed model. One is the Sod shock tube simulation. The other is a strong shock of Mach number 5. 09 diffracting around a corner.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "43", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "46", "date_publication": "March 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "43 - 46"}, "authors": ["Chenghai Sun", "Baoguo Wang", "Mengyu Shen"], "keywords": ["Adaptation models", "Computational modeling", "Electric shock", "Equations", "Lattice Boltzmann methods", "Mathematical model", "Euler equation", "N S equation", "adaptive velocity", "lattice Boltzmann", "perfect gas", ""], "arnumber": "6083247"}
