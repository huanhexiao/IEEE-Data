The results showed that the two main toughening mechanisms, localized shear yielding and void plastics growth, which occurred near the threshold region because the rubber size is much less than the plastics size at the crack front, improved the near threshold FCP behavior and increased the threshold. The stable FCP behavior was obviously improved with the FCP rates decreased to less than 21%.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "22", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "March 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "22 - 26"}, "authors": ["Huiyang Luo", "Zhenhua Sun", "Shiqi Zhao"], "keywords": ["Epoxy resins", "Fatigue", "Resistance", "Rubber", "Stress", "Testing", "epoxy resin", "fatigue crack propagation", "rubber toughening", "toughening mechanisms", ""], "arnumber": "6083242"}
