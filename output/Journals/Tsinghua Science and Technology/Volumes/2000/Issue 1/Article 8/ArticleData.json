In this paper, the satellite attitude dynamics equations including the gravity gradient torque and wheel motor torque are derived using Euler parameters. The necessary conditions for optimum solutions subject to the performance index are obtained via Pontryagin s principle. The resulting two point boundary value problem is solved numerically with an optimal slew illustrated by example.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "33", "date_publication": "March 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "31 - 33"}, "authors": ["Junfeng Li", "Min Xu", "Shimin Wang"], "keywords": ["Angular velocity", "Earth", "Gravity", "Satellites", "Space vehicles", "Torque", "Wheels", "attitude dynamics small satellites", "gravity gradient", "large angle maneuver", "optimal control", ""], "arnumber": "6083244"}
