The resulting scheme is a two point second order central scheme, which not only retains the advantages of a simple Riemann solver free recipe, but is also easier to implement near boundaries. Numerical results for several sample flow problems show that the present scheme has higher accuracy and better shock resolution than the original one.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "39", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "42", "date_publication": "March 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "39 - 42"}, "authors": ["Zengchan Zhang", "Mengyu Shen"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Electric shock", "Equations", "Finite element methods", "Mathematical model", "Physics", "Turbomachinery", "central differencing", "conservation laws", "numerical method", "shock resolution", ""], "arnumber": "6083246"}
