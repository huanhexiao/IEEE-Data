This paper demonstrates a similar conclusion in the state space. Some new expressions on modal parameter matrices were set up first. A generalized velocity method (GVM) is then demonstrated in a systematic way. This method is the so called complex mode velocity method, but the expressions and schemes are given in terms of parametric matrices in configuration space. Theoretical comparison of this GVM with the traditional complex mode method shows some interesting conclusions. The latter approach is actually a generalized displacement method (GDM). Without mode reduction, the displacement responses of the concerned system resulting from both approaches are identical. On the other hand, both approaches have to adopt mode reduction to become practical. Under this situation, GVM has advantages because it compensates for the contribution of the omitted high order modes to the displacement responses", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "30", "date_publication": "March 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "27 - 30"}, "authors": ["Zhichao Hou", "Zhaochang Zheng"], "keywords": ["Acceleration", "Convolution", "Equations", "Linear systems", "Matrix decomposition", "Vectors", "Vibrations", "complex mode theory", "linear vibration", "response computing", ""], "arnumber": "6083243"}
