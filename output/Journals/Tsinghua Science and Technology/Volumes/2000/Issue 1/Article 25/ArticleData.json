The proposed method constructs a set of schemes for recursively computing the parameters in predicting function of the ARMAX model. In contrast to the existing method, that only gives results for the special case of the ARX model, the method presented is suitable not only for an 8180 system, but also for an MIMO system. For the method SISO system, the method presented here is even more convenient than the exisiting ones.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "115", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "120", "date_publication": "March 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "115 - 120"}, "authors": ["Kunlin Liu"], "keywords": ["Computational modeling", "Data models", "MIMO", "Mathematical model", "Polynomials", "Predictive models", "ARMAX model", "d-step ahead predictor", "predicting function", "recursive parameter method", ""], "arnumber": "6083261"}
