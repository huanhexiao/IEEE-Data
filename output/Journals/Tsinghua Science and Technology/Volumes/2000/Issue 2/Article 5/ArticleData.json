In this paper, a quantitative structure is established for the classical ICFs.

Several illustrative examples are given.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "140", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "144", "date_publication": "June 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "140 - 144"}, "authors": ["Xiaoqun Wang"], "keywords": ["Jacobian matrices", "Monte Carlo methods", "Orbits", "Polynomials", "Presses", "Vectors", "Sobolev's Theorem", "cubature formula", "invariant cubature formula", "numerical integration", ""], "arnumber": "6083269"}
