Generic Model Control (GMC) is used to control the nonlinear process while the process runs normally because of its robust control performance. If a fault occurs in the sensor, a sensor bias vector is then introduced to the output equation of the process model. The sensor bias vector is estimated on-line during every control period using the STF. The estimated sensor bias vector is used to develop a fault detection mechanism to supervise the sensors. When a sensor fault occurs, the conventional GMC is switched to a fault tolerant control scheme, which is, in essence, a state estimation and output prediction based GMC. The laboratory experimental results on a three-tank system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Sensor Fault Tolerant Generic Model Control (SFTGMC) approach.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "201", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "207", "date_publication": "June 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "201 - 207"}, "authors": ["Xiaoqing Xie", "Donghua Zhou", "Yihui Jin"], "keywords": ["Fault detection", "Fault tolerance", "Fault tolerant systems", "Mathematical model", "Process control", "State estimation", "Vectors", "Generic Model Control (GMC)", "Strong Tracking Filter (STF)", "fault tolerant control", "nonlinear processes", ""], "arnumber": "6083282"}
