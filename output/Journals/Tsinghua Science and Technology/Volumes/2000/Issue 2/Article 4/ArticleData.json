The conclusion is independent of the concrete forms of the vector and scalar coupling potentials because of the nilpotent matrix realization of supersymmetric quantum mechanical algebra. The supersymmetry of this kind of Dirac equation requires that a spin-orbit coupling term be introduced into the associated supersymmetric Hamiltonian.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "137", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "139", "date_publication": "June 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "137 - 139"}, "authors": ["Changcun Tu", "Weibin Zhu", "Dong Ruan"], "keywords": ["Couplings", "Electric potential", "Energy states", "Equations", "Quantum mechanics", "Vectors", "Dirac equation", "supersymmetric quantum mechanics", "supersymmetry", ""], "arnumber": "6083268"}
