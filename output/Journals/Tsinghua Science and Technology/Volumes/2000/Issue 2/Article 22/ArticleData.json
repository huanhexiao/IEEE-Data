The energy dissipation prevents wash out downstream. When air is not entrained in the water flow, the aerators act as artificial irregularities in the channel. The energy dissipation due to the aerators in the channel without entrained air is greater than when air is entrained in the water flow. Correlations of the experimental data can be used to estimate the energy dissipation effect of the aerators on the outlet structure for the three test cases.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "222", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "225", "date_publication": "June 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "222 - 225"}, "authors": ["Mengxi Nie"], "keywords": ["Atmospheric modeling", "Cavity resonators", "Energy dissipation", "Energy measurement", "Reservoirs", "Resistance", "Trajectory", "aerator", "diffusion", "energy dissipation", "energy intensity", "jet-trajectory", "open channel", ""], "arnumber": "6083286"}
