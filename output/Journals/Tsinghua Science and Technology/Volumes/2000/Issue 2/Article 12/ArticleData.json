The crosslinking reaction mechanism is investigated using FT-IR spectral analysis. The results indicate that maleic acid reacts with hydroxyl groups in PYA to form mono- and bis-ester in a two-step process.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "172", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "175", "date_publication": "June 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "172 - 175"}, "authors": ["Pingrui Meng", "Cuixian Chen", "Lixin Yu", "Jiding Li", "Weijun Jiang"], "keywords": ["Absorption", "Chemicals", "Ethanol", "Polymers", "Spectral analysis", "Temperature", "Fourier transform-Infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry", "crosslinking mechanism", "maleic acid (MA)", "pervaporation", "polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)", ""], "arnumber": "6083276"}
