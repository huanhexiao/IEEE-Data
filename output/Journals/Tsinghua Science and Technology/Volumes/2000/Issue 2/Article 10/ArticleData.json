Structurally well-defined compounds are needed for the study of the roles of the phospho-proteins in biological processes. In this paper, O-phosphorylated oligopeptides were synthesized using bis-alkyloxy-N, N-dialkylphosphoramidite reacting with the oligopeptide followed by oxidation. Many hydroxyl groups in oligopeptides can be phosphorylated in one step.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "163", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "166", "date_publication": "June 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "163 - 166"}, "authors": ["Yanrnei Li", "Yufen Zhao", "Waldmann Herbert"], "keywords": ["Biological processes", "Compounds", "Oxidation", "Peptides", "Proteins", "Solids", "oxidation", "phosphoramidite", "phosphorylated oligopeptide", "synthesis", ""], "arnumber": "6083274"}
