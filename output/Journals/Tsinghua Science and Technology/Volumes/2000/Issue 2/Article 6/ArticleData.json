In this paper, we introduce and study a new measure of irregularity, called volume dispersion. It is a measure of deviation of point sets from the uniform distribution. We then generalize the concept of volume dispersion to more general cases as measures of representation of point sets for general probability distributions. Various relations among these measures and the traditional discrepancy and dispersion are investigated.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "145", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "149", "date_publication": "June 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "145 - 149"}, "authors": ["Xiaoqun Wang"], "keywords": ["Dispersion", "Distribution functions", "Optimization", "Positron emission tomography", "Vectors", "Volume measurement", "discrepancy", "dispersion", "optimization", "quasi-Monte Carlo method", "volume dispersion", ""], "arnumber": "6083270"}
