Hopf. In his work he deduced a functional equation governing the evolution of the characteristic functional of a turbulent velocity field in an incompressible field. In this paper we present a derivation of a dynamical equation governing the evolution of the characteristic functional of a turbulent velocity field in a compressible field. However, the characteristic functional equations we derived are governing the motions of an ideal gas and vander Waals gas.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "154", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "158", "date_publication": "June 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "154 - 158"}, "authors": ["M.
