The paper presents a numerical model, which combines 1\u20130 and 2-D models to compute the mixing zone for the Sibao Segment of the Qiantang River. The simple 1\u20130 model was used to model the flow for the entire river using field data as the boundary conditions. The complete depth-averaged turbulence model was used for the 2-D computation. The calculated results agree well with the field observations. The analysis provides a practical method for the computation of mixing zones in tidal rivers.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "231", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "235", "date_publication": "June 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "231 - 235"}, "authors": ["Yuliang Li", "Xueyi Zhou", "Tao Hu"], "keywords": ["Computational modeling", "Equations", "Floods", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Rivers", "Tides", "mixing zone", "numerical simulation", "strong tidal river", "turbulence model", ""], "arnumber": "6083288"}
