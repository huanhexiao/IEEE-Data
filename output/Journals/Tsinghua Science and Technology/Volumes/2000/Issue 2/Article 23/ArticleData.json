The SIMPLEC procedure is used to develop an economical discrete method for staggered grids to analyze flows in a 90\u00b0 bend. This paper describes how to change a program in rectangular coordinate into a boundary-fitted coordinate. The results compare well with experimental data for flow in a meandering channel showing the efficiency of the model and the discrete method.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "226", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "230", "date_publication": "June 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "226 - 230"}, "authors": ["Yiping Hong", "Yongcan Chen", "Xueyi Zhou", "Changzhao Yu"], "keywords": ["Bismuth", "Computational modeling", "Equations", "Interpolation", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Transforms", "boundary-fitted coordinates", "depth-averaged", "k-&#x03B5", "model", "meandering channel", "staggered grid", ""], "arnumber": "6083287"}
