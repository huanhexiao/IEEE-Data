In this paper, two new methods are presented for multiple face location via motion analysis techniques. The first method is based on motion segmentation. The authors introduce a new segmentation method by computing optical flow only on the Motion Zero-Crossing Boundary (MZCB) followed by a simple clustering method to segment each person. Then an intuitive but effective location algorithm is applied to locate each face. The second method is derived from the Hough Transform (HT). After modeling a head outline as a curve consisting of circle segments, a modified HT is used to find the center of each face. Finally, the two methods are compared and the future research directions are given.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "183", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "186", "date_publication": "June 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "183 - 186"}, "authors": ["Chao Yuan", "Changshui Zhang"], "keywords": ["Computer vision", "Face", "Image motion analysis", "Motion segmentation", "Optical filters", "Optical imaging", "Hough Transform", "face location", "optical flow", ""], "arnumber": "6083279"}
