The model for spin half is solved and the result shows that an alternating field can suppress magnetic tunneling. The probability of tunneling for large spin is obtained with the help of quantum-mechanical perturbation theory.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "132", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "136", "date_publication": "June 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "132 - 136"}, "authors": ["Juanjuan Mao", "Xiaabing Wang", "Rang Lu", "Lee Chang"], "keywords": ["Anisotropic magnetoresistance", "Interference", "Magnetic tunneling", "Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy", "alternating magnetic fields", "dynamical suppression", "magnetic tunneling", ""], "arnumber": "6083267"}
