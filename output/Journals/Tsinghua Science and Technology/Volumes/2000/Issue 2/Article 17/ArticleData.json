Data from industrial plants always contain some peak noise, but \u2018denoise\u2019 algorithms such as \u2018SureShrink\u2019 can have difficulty in handling sudden large excursions in the corrupting noise. In the new algorithm the peak noise is reduced prior to filtering using the SureShrink algorithm. The pre-screened data can be used to build a number of projections to latent structures regression models. Data from an industrial fluidized bed reactor is used to evaluate the new algorithm, which demonstrates improved performance in terms of improved modeling capability through use of the new data pre-filtering algorithm.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "193", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "200", "date_publication": "June 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "193 - 200"}, "authors": ["Jingchun Wang", "Yihui Jin", "Morris Julian"], "keywords": ["Data models", "Filtering", "Noise", "Noise measurement", "Process control", "Wavelet transforms", "modeling", "projection to latent structures", "wavelet transform", ""], "arnumber": "6083281"}
