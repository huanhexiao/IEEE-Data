In order to improve the tracking properties of the SG algorithm, the forgetting gradient (FG) algorithm is presented, and its convergence is analyzed by using the martingale hyperconvergence theorem. The results show that: (1) for time-invariant deterministic systems, the parameter estimates given by the FG algorithm converge consistently to their true values; (2) for stochastic time-varying systems, the parameter tracking error is bounded, that is, the parameter tracking error is small when both the parameter change rate and the observation noise are small.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "187", "volume": "5", "lastpage": "192", "date_publication": "June 2000", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2000", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "187 - 192"}, "authors": ["Feng Ding", "Jiaben Yang", "Yongmao Xu"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Convergence", "Noise", "Parameter estimation", "Stochastic processes", "Time varying systems", "Vectors", "forgetting gradient algorithm", "identification", "parameter estimation", "time-varying system", ""], "arnumber": "6083280"}
