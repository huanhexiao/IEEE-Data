This paper presents a shape recognition and retrieval algorithm. The algorithm first extracts the skeletal features using the medial axis transform. Then, the features are transformed into a string of symbols with the similarity among those symbols computed based on the edit distance. Finally, the shapes are identified using dynamic programming. Two public datasets are analyzed to demonstrate that the present approach is better than previous approaches.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "739", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "745", "date_publication": "Dec. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "739 - 745"}, "authors": ["Hongfei Pan", "Dong Liang", "Jun Tang", "Nian Wang", "Wei Li"], "keywords": ["Databases", "Dynamic programming", "Electric shock", "Feature extraction", "Shape", "Skeleton", "Transforms", "dynamic programming", "edit distance", "medial axis transform", "skeletal features", ""], "arnumber": "6076300"}
