The whole frame error concealment (EC) algorithm is then necessary for the decoder to improve the video quality. A refined bidirectional motion vector extrapolation was developed to improve the motion vector estimation precision by alleviating the effect of overlapped and hole regions with an adaptive overlapped block motion compensation to reduce block artifacts. A prescription-based framework was then developed to improve the error concealment at the encoder side. Simulations show that the EC algorithm at the decoder side outperforms the existing methods by 2\u20138 dB. Moreover, the prescription-based framework at the encoder side provides further peak signal to noise ratio improvement.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "691", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "697", "date_publication": "Dec. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "691 - 697"}, "authors": ["Yang Zhang", "Huijuan Cui", "Kun Tang"], "keywords": ["Bismuth", "Decoding", "Extrapolation", "PSNR", "Quality assessment", "Streaming media", "Vectors", "H.264/AVC", "entire frame loss", "error concealment", "motion vector", ""], "arnumber": "6076060"}
