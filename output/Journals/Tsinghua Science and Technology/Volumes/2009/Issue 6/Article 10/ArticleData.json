In addition, the frequently proposed high-dimensional unitary operations are very difficult to realize experimentally. To maintain the integrity of the unknown quantum state to be teleported, this analysis does not focus attention on the original multi-particle state but seeks to construct a faithful channel with an ancillary particle and a unified high-dimensional unitary operation. The result shows that if the construction of the multi-group Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair succeeds, the original multi-particle state can be used to deterministically teleport the unknown quantum state of the entangled multiple particles which avoids undermining the integrity of the unknown state brought about by failure. This unified high-dimensional operation is appealing due to the obvious experimental convenience.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "735", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "738", "date_publication": "Dec. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "735 - 738"}, "authors": ["Min Jiang", "Zengke Zhang", "Xiangxu Li", "Hui Li"], "keywords": ["Atmospheric measurements", "Educational institutions", "Manganese", "Particle measurements", "Probabilistic logic", "Quantum entanglement", "Teleportation", "Bell-state measurement", "auxiliary particle", "multi-particle state", "probabilistic teleportation", "quantum state transfer", "standard method", ""], "arnumber": "6076299"}
