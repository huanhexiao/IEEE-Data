A detailed cost and performance analysis of hybrid networks is done for three different grooming policies. The hybrid network cost is compared with that of an opaque network for equal traffic demand and equal blocking probability of dynamic requests of label switched paths. An algorithm is given to design optimum hybrid nodes for different grooming policies to provide the desired blocking probability for a given number of dynamic connection requests. The results show that all three applied grooming policies (I P layer first, optical layer first, and one hop first) result in lower costs of the hybrid network architecture than for the opaque network. In addition, an adaptive one hop first method is given to improve the best of the applied grooming policies, which limits grooming in heavily loaded hybrid nodes to achieve load balancing. The simulation results show that the new policy significantly reduces the overall blocking probability.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "677", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "684", "date_publication": "Dec. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "677 - 684"}, "authors": ["Yining Cao", "Hao Buchta", "Erwin Patzak", "Xiaoping Zheng", "Hanyi Zhang"], "keywords": ["IP networks", "Multiprotocol label switching", "Network topology", "Optical fiber networks", "Optical fibers", "Optical switches", "Topology", "cost analysis", "dynamic traffic", "hybrid networks", "traffic grooming", ""], "arnumber": "6076058"}
