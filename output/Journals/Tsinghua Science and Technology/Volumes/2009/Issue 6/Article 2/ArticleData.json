However, there are many difficulties with face recognition systems. For example, an imposter could login the face recognition system by stealing the facial photograph of a person registered on the facial recognition system. The security of the face recognition system requires a live detection system to prevent system login using photographs of a human face. This paper describes an effective, efficient face live detection method which uses physiological motion detected by estimating the eye blinks from a captured video sequence and an eye contour extraction algorithm. This technique uses the conventional active shape model with a random forest classifier trained to recognize the local appearance around each landmark. This local match provides more robustness for optimizing the fitting procedure. Tests show that this face live detection approach successfully discriminates a live human face from a photograph of the registered person's face to increase the face recognition system reliability.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "685", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "690", "date_publication": "Dec. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "685 - 690"}, "authors": ["Liting Wang", "Xiaoqing Ding", "Chi Fang"], "keywords": ["Active shape model", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Face", "Face recognition", "Physiology", "Shape", "Training", "eye blink estimation", "eye contour extraction", "face live detection", ""], "arnumber": "6076059"}
