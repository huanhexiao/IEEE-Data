This analysis treats the downlink channels as random quantities and exploits their second order statistics in robust precoding schemes to correct the errors introduced in the feedback procedure. The time-domain channel vectors are found to reduce the feedback overhead more than the frequency-domain vectors. A compression and restoration method and a codebook design are also given to obtain compact feedback quantities. Simulations show that the robust LP and THP are superior to the previous methods with tradeoffs possible between performance and feedback overhead.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "725", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "731", "date_publication": "Dec. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "725 - 731"}, "authors": ["Yongtao Su", "Xianda Zhang"], "keywords": ["Base stations", "Covariance matrix", "Downlink", "OFDM", "Robustness", "Transmitting antennas", "Vectors", "Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP)", "linear precoding", "multiple-input single-output (MISO)", "orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)", ""], "arnumber": "6076065"}
