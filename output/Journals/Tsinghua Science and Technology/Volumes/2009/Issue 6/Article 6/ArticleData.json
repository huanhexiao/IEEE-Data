In this paper, the throughput of a convergence network is analyzed based on the standardization project for specific requirements for local and metropolitan area networks in China, referred to as broadband wireless multimedia systems. The convergence network is modeled as a combination of a broadcasting channel and a multi-access channel with interference. The throughput is then given as a function of the time resource allocation by calculating the channel capacity with interference. The maximum throughput and the optimal time resource allocation are then determined for a given delay constraint and traffic requirements. The results give guidelines for time resource allocation and system design for convergence networks.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "710", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "717", "date_publication": "Dec. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "710 - 717"}, "authors": ["Bo Bai", "Zhigang Cao", "Wei Chen", "I.
