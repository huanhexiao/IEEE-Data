However, most approaches have been either trial-and-error or only for special cases. This paper presents a non-trial-and-error design method for four-parameter lag-lead compensators. Here, the compensator design problem is formulated into a polynomial function optimization problem and solved by using the recently developed sum-of-squares (SOS) techniques. This result not only provides a useful design method but also shows the power of the SOS techniques.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "732", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "734", "date_publication": "Dec. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "732 - 734"}, "authors": ["Zhiheng Li", "Shengchao Yin", "Yi Zhang", "Li Li"], "keywords": ["Design methodology", "Manuals", "Optimization", "Polynomials", "Programming", "Random access memory", "lag-lead compensator", "polynomial function optimization", "semi-definite programming (SDP)", "sum of squares (SOS)", ""], "arnumber": "6076298"}
