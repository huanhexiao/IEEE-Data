In this paper, cardiac myocyte cultured on silica substrate were exerted stretch loadings using a custom-made substrate stretch device. The effect of stretch on the debonding between cardiac myocyte and silica substrate was studied. Finite element analysis (FEA) was developed to uncover it. Meanwhile, a Xu-Needleman formulation was used in the simulation of the interaction relationship to define the surface interaction behavior for contact surfaces between cell and substrate. 2-D adhesive cell model with nonlinear viscoelastic constitutive relationship was established to simulate the mechanical debonding behavior. This computational simulation contributes to reveal the mechanism underlying the debonding behaviors of single cardiac myocyte under cyclic substrate stretch.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "31", "date_publication": "Dec. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S2", "pages": "27 - 31"}, "authors": ["Jun Qiu", "Tao Tang", "Meng Zhang", "Zhuo Zhuang"], "keywords": ["Cells (biology)", "Computational modeling", "Finite element methods", "Strain", "Stress", "Substrates", "cardiac myocyte", "cell debonding", "cyclic stretch", "interaction", "numerical simulation", ""], "arnumber": "6075559"}
