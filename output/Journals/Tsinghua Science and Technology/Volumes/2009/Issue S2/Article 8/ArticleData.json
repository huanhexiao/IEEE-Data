The software contains a database which stores all the material data, finite element analysis (FEA) model and results, strain gages and displacement transducers' information, etc. The software can also compare the test data with the FEA and theoretical results, and forecast the next and the final test results based on the analytical and test data in real time. With the support of this software, aircraft designers can monitor the strain and displacement data through distributed monitors and calculate the structure stress and safety margin in real time and can prevent unexpected accidents. Now this software has already been successfully used in the static test of ARJ21 with its high accuracy and reliability.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "38", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "42", "date_publication": "Dec. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S2", "pages": "38 - 42"}, "authors": ["Xiuhua Chen", "Haitao Fan", "Jinli Pei", "Hai Wang", "Junfeng Zhao", "Weiyi Guo", "Lin'gang Zhu", "Guangrong Zhu"], "keywords": ["Aircraft", "Databases", "Monitoring", "Real time systems", "Servers", "Software", "Stress", "airworthiness", "certification", "full scale", "real time", "static test", ""], "arnumber": "6075561"}
