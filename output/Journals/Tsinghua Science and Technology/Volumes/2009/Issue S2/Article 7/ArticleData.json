In the case that both of the target and platform travel with constant velocity, the angle measurements cannot provide any information of the range between the target and the platform. The platform has to maneuver in order to estimate the range of the target. The observability of passive ranging is analyzed based on singular value decomposition of observable matrix. The relationship between the observability and aerocraft maneuver is obtained. Based on observability and Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB), the maneuver strategy for improving observability is derived. To estimate the relative distance of the target and the platform, an algorithm of passive ranging is given using the receding horizon filter method. The simulation results show that the proposed method has a high estimation accuracy.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "32", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "37", "date_publication": "Dec. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S2", "pages": "32 - 37"}, "authors": ["Baoqing Yang", "Yu Yao", "Fenghua He"], "keywords": ["Distance measurement", "Estimation", "Finite impulse response filter", "Matrix decomposition", "Observability", "Simulation", "Vectors", "Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLB)", "observability", "passive ranging", "receding horizon filter", "singular value decomposition", ""], "arnumber": "6075560"}
