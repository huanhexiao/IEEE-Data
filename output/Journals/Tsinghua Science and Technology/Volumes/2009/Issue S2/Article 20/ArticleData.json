Moldability of CNT-dispersed polymers is the key technology for the successful improvement of properties. As CNT length has great impact on the moldability (e.g., viscosity) as well as physical performance of nanocomposites, length control of CNT by milling process is focused on in this study. The CNTs and CNT-dispersed compounds were subject to milling process and length distribution of CNTs was measured using SEM and rheological properties of the compounds were discussed. Finally, carbon-fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) using length-controlled CNT-dispersed epoxy was successfully fabricated and its mechanical properties were measured too. Improvement of mechanical properties of CNT-dispersed CFRP is demonstrated by the comparison to CFRP without CNTs.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "100", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "104", "date_publication": "Dec. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S2", "pages": "100 - 104"}, "authors": ["Tornohiro Yokozeki", "Takahira Aoki", "Akiko Arai", "Masaru Ishibashi", "Takashit Yanagisawa"], "keywords": ["Compounds", "Dispersion", "Laminates", "Length measurement", "Mechanical factors", "Plastics", "Viscosity", "carbon nanotu be", "carbon-fiber reinforced plastics", "mechanical properties", "nanocomposites", ""], "arnumber": "6075573"}
