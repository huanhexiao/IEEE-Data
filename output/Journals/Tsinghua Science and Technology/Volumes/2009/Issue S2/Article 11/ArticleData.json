The evaluations of initial fatigue qualities of the two types of holes were carried out based on the equivalent initial flaw size method and coincidence criterion. Fatigue fracture surfaces were observed by stereomicroscope. The results show that the location where the fatigue crack initiates is unchanged when these two different drilling processes are used. A longer fatigue life shows a more severe dispersibility. When the Winslow drilling process is adopted, the equivalent initial flaw size is smaller than 0.125 mm. The Winslow drilling process meets the requirement of coincidence criterion.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "54", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "57", "date_publication": "Dec. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S2", "pages": "54 - 57"}, "authors": ["Weiping Gu", "Honglu Xu", "Jun Liu", "Zhufeng Yue"], "keywords": ["Drilling machines", "Fasteners", "Fatigue", "Finite element methods", "Stress", "Surface cracks", "Surface treatment", "drilling process", "fatigue life", "fracture surface", "initial fatigue quality", ""], "arnumber": "6075564"}
