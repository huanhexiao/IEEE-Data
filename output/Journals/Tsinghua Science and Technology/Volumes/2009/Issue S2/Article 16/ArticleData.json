The scheme accounts for in-plane as well as out-of-plane motions. The control action is realized by adjusting only the tensional and electro-dynamic forces in the tether. Even though the proposed feedback law is not analytically explicit, it is easy to determine it by using a rapid re-computation of open-loop optimal control online and updating the control command at a fixed sampling interval. For each online step, the open-loop optimal control problem is solved by discretizing the continuous control problem first and then numerically solving the resulting large-scale optimization problem via nonlinear programming. The design of the feedback controller is based on a simple model which enjoys the advantage of low computational effort required for optimization, whereas the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed strategy are demonstrated by using a multi-body dynamics model of much higher fidelity.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "79", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "83", "date_publication": "Dec. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S2", "pages": "79 - 83"}, "authors": ["Hao Wen", "Dongpings Jin", "Haiyan Hu"], "keywords": ["Computational modeling", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Optimal control", "Orbits", "Satellites", "Vectors", "electro-dynamic tether", "nonlinear programming", "optimal control", "predictive control", ""], "arnumber": "6075569"}
