The results show that Fourier's law is equivalent to the Lagrange equations with negligible inertia forces. The application of Lagrange equations in heat conduction makes it possible to unify the treatment of heat transfer and mechanics as well as electrics through the method of analytical mechanics.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "12", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Dec. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S2", "pages": "12 - 16"}, "authors": ["Jing Wu", "Zengyuan Guo", "Bai Song"], "keywords": ["Equations", "Force", "Heat transfer", "Heating", "Thermal analysis", "Thermal force", "analytical mechanics", "heat conduction", "lagrange equations", "thermal mass", ""], "arnumber": "6075556"}
