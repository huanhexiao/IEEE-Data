The transition from structural random response to deterministic response is realized by the natural excitation technique (NExT). The parameter-decoupled free vibration equation of inter-story shearing structures is deduced, which can simplify the procedure of identification and reduce the amount of calculation. Through the effective combination of the NExT, the parameter-decoupled method, and the extended Kalman filter (EKF) algorithm, a good scheme is presented for stiffness identification of inter-story shearing structures under ambient excitation. Using inter-story shearing structures with six-degree-of-freedom and ten-degree-of-freedom as examples, the scheme is tested by numerical simulation and experiment. The result shows that the maximum of identification error is 7.82%, and it can reach the requirement of engineering application basically.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "69", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "74", "date_publication": "Dec. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S2", "pages": "69 - 74"}, "authors": ["Zhuo Wang", "Weiming Yan", "Yunda Shao"], "keywords": ["Acceleration", "Damping", "Equations", "Floors", "Mathematical model", "Shearing", "Vibrations", "ambient excitation", "inter-story shearing structures", "stiffness identification", ""], "arnumber": "6075567"}
