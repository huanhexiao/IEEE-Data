However, these alloys have been classified as 'difficult-to-machine' materials. In order to improve the cutting efficiency in machining the titanium alloys, a new we matrix composite tool material was prepared by hot pressing technology in this research. The cutting performance of the newly developed tool material in machining titanium alloy Ti6AI4V was investigated. The factors which influence the wear modes of the tool were investigated and the wear mechanisms were analyzed. Results show that the high temperature and mechanical friction are the main factors in the wear process. The wear mechanisms of the tool in machining titanium alloys are adhesion wear and abrasive wear.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "75", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "78", "date_publication": "Dec. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S2", "pages": "75 - 78"}, "authors": ["Fazhan Yang", "Guangyao Meng", "Jun Zhao", "Xing Ai"], "keywords": ["Adhesives", "Chemicals", "Machining", "Materials", "Optical wavelength conversion", "Titanium alloys", "Ti6AI4V", "cutting performance", "tool materials", "wear mechanisms", ""], "arnumber": "6075568"}
