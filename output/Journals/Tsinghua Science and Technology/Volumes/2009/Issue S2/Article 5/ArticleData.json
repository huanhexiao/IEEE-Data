By proper simplification and linearization, the state space equation of the system was established for linear analysis and control design. The simulation method for such a coupled system by multi-body dynamics program was also provided. The designed controller with a simple low-pass filter for the flexible inverted pendulum was validated by the simulation of a simple flexible pendulum sample. The result demonstrates a new method of designing and verifying a feedback controller of a flexible multi-body system.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "22", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "Dec. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S2", "pages": "22 - 26"}, "authors": ["Jiali Tang", "Gexue Ren"], "keywords": ["Control systems", "Dynamics", "Equations", "Force", "Mathematical model", "Shape", "Vibrations", "flexible multi-body dynamics", "inverted pendulum", "state space", "transfer function", ""], "arnumber": "6075558"}
