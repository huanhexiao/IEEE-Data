Goyal et al. provided a general transformation from any honest verifier statistical zero-knowledge argument to a concurrent statistical zero-knowledge argument. Their transformation relies only on the existence of one-way functions. For the simplified transformation, the witness indistinguishable proof of knowledge protocols in \u201cparallel\u201d not only plays the role of preamble but also removes some computational zero-knowledge proofs, which Goyal et al. used to prove the existence of the valid openings to the commitments. Therefore, although some computational zero-knowledge proofs are replaced with a weaker notion, the witness indistinguishable protocol, the proof of soundness can still go through.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "255", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "263", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "255 - 263"}, "authors": ["Puwen Wei", "Guoyan Zhang", "Lijiang Zhang", "Xiaoyun Wang"], "keywords": ["Educational institutions", "Generators", "Polynomials", "Probabilistic logic", "Protocols", "Public key", "Receivers", "concurrent", "decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption", "honest verifier", "statistical zero-knowledge", "witness indistinguishable", ""], "arnumber": "6074901"}
