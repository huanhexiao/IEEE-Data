Comparison of the effectiveness of the two contracts indicates that a long-term contract is more effective than a single-period contract in improving the profit potential of both the total supply chain and each member in the supply chain. This conclusion is useful to the decision-maker in supply chains with fuzzy market demand.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "218", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "224", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "218 - 224"}, "authors": ["Junyan Wang", "Ruiqing Zhao", "Wansheng Tang"], "keywords": ["Contracts", "Density functional theory", "Distribution functions", "Educational institutions", "Games", "Supply chains", "fuzzy variable", "game theory", "long-term contract", "supply chain", ""], "arnumber": "6074896"}
