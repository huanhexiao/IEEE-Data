The choice of the cost parameter for training the SVM model is always a critical issue. This analysis studies how the cost parameter determines the hyper-plane; especially for classifications using only positive data and unlabeled data. An algorithm is given for the entire solution path by choosing the 'best' cost parameter while training the SVM model. The performance of the algorithm is compared with conventional implementations that use default values as the cost parameter on two synthetic data sets and two real-world data sets. The results show that the algorithm achieves better results when dealing with positive data and unlabeled classification.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "242", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "251", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "242 - 251"}, "authors": ["Limin Yao", "Jie Tang", "Juanzi Li"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Classification algorithms", "Equations", "Mathematical model", "Support vector machines", "Text categorization", "Training", "cost parameter", "positive and unlabeled classification", "support vector machine", ""], "arnumber": "6074899"}
