However, the conventional method to examine the tongue lacks an acceptable standard and does not provide the means for sharing information. This paper describes a segmentation method to extract tongue coatings. First, the tongue body was extracted from the original image using the watershed transform. Then, a threshold method was applied to the image to eliminate the light from the camera flash. Finally, a threshold method using the Otsu model in combination with a splitting-merging method was used in the red, green, and blue (RGB) space to extract the thin coating. The combination of the above two methods is applied in the hue, saturation, and value (HSV) space to extract the thick coating. The feasibility of this method is tested by experiments, and the accuracy of segmentation is 95.9%.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "170", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "175", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "170 - 175"}, "authors": ["Linda Yunlu Bai", "Yundi Shi", "Jia Wu", "Yonghong Zhang", "Weiliang Wong", "Yu Wu", "Jing Bai"], "keywords": ["Coatings", "Filling", "Gray-scale", "Image segmentation", "Medical diagnostic imaging", "Tongue", "automatic analysis", "tongue coating", "traditional Chinese medicine", ""], "arnumber": "6074889"}
