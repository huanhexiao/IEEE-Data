Most known approaches have only studied vehicles on freeways. This paper presents a model for the spacing distribution of queuing vehicles at a signalized junction based on random-matrix theory. The spacing distribution of a Gaussian symplectic ensemble (GSE) fits well with recently measured spacing distribution data. These results are also compared with measured spacing distribution observed for the car parking problem. Vehicle stationary queuing and vehicle parking have different spacing distributions due to different driving patterns.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "252", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "254", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "252 - 254"}, "authors": ["Xuexiang Jin", "Yuelong Su", "Yi Zhang", "Zheng Wei", "Li Li"], "keywords": ["Data models", "Fluctuations", "Junctions", "Queueing analysis", "Vehicles", "Coulomb gas", "Gaussian symplectic ensemble (GSE)", "queuing vehicles", "spacing distribution", ""], "arnumber": "6074900"}
