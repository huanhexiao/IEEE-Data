The algorithm gives the initial delay and sequence distortion curve with just one iteration of the algorithm. A simple GOP-level rate and distortion model was then developed for two-level constant quality rate control. The initial delay values and the corresponding optimal GOP-level bit allocation scheme can be obtained for video streaming along with the proper initial delay for various distortion tolerance levels. Simulations show that the algorithm provides an efficient solution for delay and buffer constrained GOP-level rate control for video streaming.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "183", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "188", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "183 - 188"}, "authors": ["Yang Lu", "Jun Xie", "Hang Li", "Huijuan Cui"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Bit rate", "Delay", "Encoding", "Heuristic algorithms", "PSNR", "Streaming media", "adaptive group of pictures (GOP)", "bit allocation", "consistent quality", "distortion", "initial delay", ""], "arnumber": "6074891"}
