There are two important events depicted by the aspect graph approach, edge-edge-edge (EEE) events and edge-vertex (EV) events. This paper presents an algorithm to compute EEE events by characteristic analysis based on conicoid theory, in contrast to current algorithms that focus too much on EV events and often overlook the importance of EEE events. Also, the paper provides a standard flowchart for the viewpoint space partitioning based on aspect graph theory that makes it suitable for perspective models. The partitioning result best demonstrates the algorithm's efficiency with more valuable viewpoints found with the help of EEE events, which can definitely help to achieve high recognition rate for 3-D object recognition.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "264", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "270", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "264 - 270"}, "authors": ["Chenye Wu", "Huimin Ma"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions", "Ellipsoids", "Equations", "Mathematical model", "Object recognition", "Partitioning algorithms", "aspect graph", "critical events", "edge-edge-edge (EEE) event", "three dimensional (3-D) object recognition", "viewpoint space partition", ""], "arnumber": "6074902"}
