This work considers the effect of a singular perturbation parameter on the model transformations to improve the criterion precision. The Maclaurin expansion method and homotopy arithmetic are introduced to obtain \u220a-dependent controllability criteria. Examples indicate that the \u220a-dependent controllability criteria are more accurate and that the controllability of two time-scale systems does not change during model transformations with these more accurate forms.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "271", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "280", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "271 - 280"}, "authors": ["Yenan Hu", "Fuchun Sun", "Huaping Liu", "Hao Wu"], "keywords": ["Controllability", "Mathematical model", "Nonlinear equations", "Perturbation methods", "Vectors", "Maclaurin expansion", "controllability", "homotopy arithmetic", "singular perturbation method", "slow-fast order reduction", "time-scale separation", ""], "arnumber": "6074903"}
