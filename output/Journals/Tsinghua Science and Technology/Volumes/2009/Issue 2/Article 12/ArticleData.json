On-line pre-measured data was used as the basis for constructing the membership functions used in a fuzzy neural network (FNN) as well as for network training to reduce the effects of various static factors, such as unbalanced input power and asymmetrical motor alignment, to increase accuracy. The preprocessed data and fuzzy logic were used to find the nonlinear mapping relationships between the data and the conclusions. The FNN was then constructed to carry motor fault diagnostics, which gives fast accurate diagnostics. The on-line fast motor fault diagnostics clearly indicate the fault type, location, and severity in running motors. This approach can also be extended to other applications.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "225", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "233", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "225 - 233"}, "authors": ["Mingchui Dong", "Takson Cheang", "Sileong Chan"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Circuit faults", "Fuzzy neural networks", "Fuzzy sets", "Induction motors", "Rotors", "Training", "fault detection and isolation", "fuzzy neural networks", "gravity-average method", "supervisory learning", ""], "arnumber": "6074897"}
