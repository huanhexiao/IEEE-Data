However, the computational complexity of space-time algorithms restricts their application in practical GPS receivers. This paper describes a reduced-rank multi-stage nested Wiener filter (MSNWF) based on subspace decomposition and Wiener filter (WF) to eliminate the effect of jamming in anti-jamming GPS receivers. A general sidelobe canceller (GSC) structure that is equivalent to the MSNWF is used to facilitate calculation of the optimal weights for the space-time processing. Simulation results demonstrate the satisfactory performance of the MSNWF to cancel jamming and the significant reduction in computational complexity by the reduced-rank processing. The technique offers a feasible space-time processing solution for anti-jamming GPS receivers.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "189", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "195", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "189 - 195"}, "authors": ["Xuebin Zhuang", "Xiaowei Cui", "Mingquan Lu", "Zhenming Feng"], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "Jamming", "Narrowband", "Receivers", "Vectors", "Wideband", "Wiener filter", "multi-stage nested Wiener filter (MSNWF)", "reduced-rank", "space-time processing", ""], "arnumber": "6074892"}
