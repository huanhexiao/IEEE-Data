This paper presents a precoded OFDM system for ICI mitigation. A precoder is introduced to relieve the ICI by transmitting N-point composite information symbols at twice the subcarrier interval. A Hadamard-matrix-like pilot pattern is used to recover the composite information symbols in a postprocessor at the receiver. Simulations show that, compared to the conventional self-cancellation scheme, this scheme gives much better signal-to-interference-noise ratio performance with much less overhead. Furthermore, the scheme can support twice the vehicle speed in time-frequency selective fading channels than the standard OFDM systems without ICI mitigation.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "206", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "211", "date_publication": "April 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "206 - 211"}, "authors": ["Yi Long", "Linling Kuang", "Jianhua Lu"], "keywords": ["Channel estimation", "Fading", "Interference", "OFDM", "Signal to noise ratio", "Time frequency analysis", "Vectors", "intercarrier interference", "multipath", "orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)", "time-varying", ""], "arnumber": "6074894"}
