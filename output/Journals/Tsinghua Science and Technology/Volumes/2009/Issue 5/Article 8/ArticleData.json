The OTA has a high slew rate (SR) and a large open loop gain with a differential pseudo-two-stage Class-AB structure. A fully compensated depletion mode capacitor is used in the switched capacitor common mode feedback block instead of a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor to reduce the fabrication cost. Simulations show that with a 1.0-V supply voltage and a 34-pF load at each output terminal, this digital differential pseudo-two-stage Class-AB OTA realized in O.13-\u03bcm technology achieves a 63.5-dB DC gain and a O.83-V output swing. The slew rate is \u00b116.29 V/\u03bcs and the total power dissipation is only 82 \u03bcW.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "601", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "605", "date_publication": "Oct. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "601 - 605"}, "authors": ["Shujuan Yin", "Yihe Sun", "Xiangyu Li"], "keywords": ["Capacitors", "Gain", "Low voltage", "Mirrors", "Power dissipation", "Strontium", "Transistors", "Class-AB", "fully compensated depletion mode MOS-capacitor", "low power", "low voltage", "operational transconductance amplifier (OTA)", ""], "arnumber": "6076258"}
