The camera-on-a-chip architecture and its on-chip functionality facilitate the design of the packaging and power consumption of the integrated capsule. The power reduction techniques were carried out at both the architectural and circuit level. Gray coding and power gating in the sensor array to eliminate almost 500/0 of the switch activity on the data bus and more than 99% of the power dissipation in each pixel at a transmitting rate of 2 frames per second. Filtering and compression in the processor reduces the data transmission by more than 2/3. A parallel fully pipelined architecture with a dedicated clock management scheme was implemented in the JPEG-LS engine to reduce the power consumption by 15.7%. The smart sensor has been implemented in 0.18 urn CMOS technology.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "586", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "592", "date_publication": "Oct. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "586 - 592"}, "authors": ["Xiaowen Li", "Milin Zhang", "Zhihua Wang", "Amine Berrnak"], "keywords": ["Arrays", "Clocks", "Image coding", "Image sensors", "Wireless communication", "Wireless sensor networks", "JPEG-LS", "digital pixel sensor", "low power", "wireless endoscope capsule", ""], "arnumber": "6076256"}
