Three indices are introduced to reflect the force transmissibility. Based on these indices and their performance charts, the optimization design process with respect to the workspace is presented in detail. The results show that the designed mechanism is not only far from every singularity but also has good force transmissibility in its workspace. These kinematic optimization indices can be extended to other parallel mechanisms.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "663", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "668", "date_publication": "Oct. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "663 - 668"}, "authors": ["Fugui Xie", "Xinjun Liu", "Liping Wang", "Jinsong Wang"], "keywords": ["Force", "Indexes", "Kinematics", "Manipulator dynamics", "Optimization", "Performance evaluation", "kinematic optimization", "parallel mechanism", "transmissibility", ""], "arnumber": "6076267"}
