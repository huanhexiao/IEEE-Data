The second gradient operator, the second class of integral theorems, the Gauss-curvature-based integral theorems, and the core property of parallel mapping are used to derive a series of parallel mapping invariants or geometrically conserved quantities. These include not only local mapping invariants but also global mapping invariants found to exist both in a curved surface and along curves on the curved surface. The parallel mapping invariants are used to identify important transformations between the reference surface and parallel surfaces. These mapping invariants and transformations have potential applications in geometry, physics, biomechanics, and mechanics in which various dynamic processes occur along or between parallel surfaces.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "646", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "654", "date_publication": "Oct. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "646 - 654"}, "authors": ["Yajun Yin", "Jiye Wu", "Qinshan Fan", "Kezhi Huang"], "keywords": ["Educational institutions", "Equations", "Geometry", "Integral equations", "Surface treatment", "Tensile stress", "Vectors", "invariants", "parallel mapping", "second class of integral theorem", "second gradient operator", "transformations", ""], "arnumber": "6076265"}
