The critical problem of data sparsity was handled by combining approaches. First, a text-selection method was designed to cover as many G2P text corpus contexts as possible. Then, various data-driven modeling methods were used with comparisons to select the best method for each polyphonic word. Finally, independent models were used for some neutral tone words in addition to the normal G2P models to achieve more compact and flexible G2P models. Tests show that these methods reduce the relative errors by 50% for both normal polyphonic words and Chinese neutral tones.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "606", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "611", "date_publication": "Oct. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "606 - 611"}, "authors": ["Lifu Yi", "Jian Li", "Jie Hao", "Ziyu Xiong"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Context", "Context modeling", "Hidden Markov models", "Predictive models", "Training", "Training data", "Chinese neutral tone", "grapheme-to-phoneme conversion", "speech synthesis", "text design", ""], "arnumber": "6076259"}
