The electrochemical potentiostat, the core element in electrochemical instruments, have been discussed as a hot topic addressing the difficulty of applying high-precision constant voltage and picoampere current measurements. Meanwhile, reliable potentiostats are in demand for complicated industrial environments with noises as well as requirements of remotemonitors. This paper describes a potentiostat for industrial glucose measurement that is not only accurate but also fault tolerant to guarantee high reliability in industrial environments. The instrument uses standard industrial communication protocols, profibus, and a 4\u201320 mA current loop, for remote control and monitoring. Experimental results show that this design has 0.01 % accuracy with 1 mV resolution for voltage applications and 0.01 % accuracy with 1 pA resolution for current measurements. The design is also shown to be highly reliable in noisy environments.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "593", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "600", "date_publication": "Oct. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "593 - 600"}, "authors": ["Yang Jin", "Hong Wang", "Haoyuan Cal", "Zhengliang Lv", "Shiyuan Yang", "Haoyuan Cai", "Junfeng Jiang"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Current measurement", "Noise", "Radio frequency", "Reliability", "Sugar", "Voltage measurement", "electrochemical potentiostat", "glucose measurements", "reliable", "remote-monitoring", ""], "arnumber": "6076257"}
