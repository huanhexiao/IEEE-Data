However, the group-based infection mechanism of computer viruses is not well understood and the selection of infection function in virus propagation modeling has not been well studied. This paper describes a point-to-group (P2G) infection mode to describe virus propagation in networks with information sharing groups. Simulations compare the constant infection and I-type infection functions with the new E-type infection function in the small-world-network environment. The simulation results show that the E-type infection function shows superior performances to that of the traditional I-type infection function in modeling the P2G virus infection mechanism and the I-type infection function shows better performance in modeling the random infection mechanism.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "669", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "676", "date_publication": "Oct. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "669 - 676"}, "authors": ["Hua Yuan", "Junjie Wu", "Guoqing Chen"], "keywords": ["Computational modeling", "Computer networks", "Computer viruses", "Computers", "Educational institutions", "Simulation", "Viruses (medical)", "computer virus propagation", "infection mode", "point-to-group propagation", "small-world-network", ""], "arnumber": "6076268"}
