This study shows that the friction effect is more significant with child headform impact than with adult headform impact and the relative angle between the headform impact direction and the hood surface greatly affects the headform impact sensitivity to the friction coefficient. The sensitivity of the headform kinematics to the friction coefficient is also analyzed. The results show that accurate friction coefficients are needed to improve predictions of pedestrian headform impacts with hoods.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "631", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "638", "date_publication": "Oct. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "631 - 638"}, "authors": ["Qi Liu", "Yang Xia", "Qing Zhou"], "keywords": ["Acceleration", "Engines", "Finite element methods", "Force", "Friction", "Injuries", "Kinematics", "friction", "head injury criterion", "hood inclining angle", "pedestrian headform", ""], "arnumber": "6076263"}
