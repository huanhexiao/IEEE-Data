Thus, the network processor (NP) has emerged as an alternative to meet these dual demands for today's network processing. The NP combines embedded multi-threaded cores with a rich memory hierarchy that can adapt to different networking circumstances when customized by the application developers. In today's NP architectures, multithreading prevails over cache mechanism, which has achieved great success in GPP to hide memory access latencies. This paper focuses on the efficiency of the cache mechanism in an NP. Theoretical timing models of packet processing are established for evaluating cache efficiency and experiments are performed based on real-life network backbone traces. Testing results show that an improvement of nearly 70% can be gained in throughput with assistance from the cache mechanism. Accordingly, the cache mechanism is still efficient and irreplaceable in network processing, despite the existing of multithreading.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "575", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "585", "date_publication": "Oct. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "575 - 585"}, "authors": ["Bo Xu", "Jian Chang", "Shimeng Huang", "Yibo Xue", "Jun Li"], "keywords": ["Educational institutions", "Memory management", "Multithreading", "Program processors", "Programming", "Random access memory", "cache", "efficiency evaluation", "network processor", ""], "arnumber": "6076255"}
