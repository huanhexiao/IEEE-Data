A multistep linear programming (MLP) algorithm was developed for decoding LDPC codes that includes a slight increase in computational complexity. The MLP decoder adaptively adds new constraints which are compatible with a selected check node to refine the results when an error is reported by the original LP decoder. The MLP decoder result is shown to have the maximum-likelihood (ML) certificate property. Simulations with moderate block length LOpe codes suggest that the M LP decoder gives better performance than both the original LP decoder and the conventional sum-product (SP) decoder.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "556", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "560", "date_publication": "Oct. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "556 - 560"}, "authors": ["Haiyang Liu", "Lianrong Ma", "Jie Chen"], "keywords": ["Iterative decoding", "Linear code", "Linear programming", "Maximum likelihood decoding", "XML", "LP decoding", "linear programming (LP)", "low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes", "maximum-likelihood (ML) certificate property", "pseudocode-word", ""], "arnumber": "6076252"}
