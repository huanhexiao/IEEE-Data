This paper presents the architectural design of a six-way VLIW digital signal processor (DSP) with clustered register files. The architecture uses a variable length instruction set and supports dynamic instruction dispatching. The one-level memory system architecture of the processor includes 16-KB instruction and data caches and 16-KB instruction and data on-chip RAM. A compiler based on the Open 64 was developed for the system. Evaluations show that the processor is suitable for high performance applications with a high code density and small program code size.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "561", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "569", "date_publication": "Oct. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "561 - 569"}, "authors": ["Zheng Shen", "Hu He", "Xu Yang", "Di Jia", "Yihe Sun"], "keywords": ["Computer architecture", "Digital signal processing", "Program processors", "Random access memory", "Registers", "System-on-a-chip", "VLIW", "clustered register file", "digital signal processor (DSP)", "variable length instruction set", "very long instruction word (VLIW)", ""], "arnumber": "6076253"}
