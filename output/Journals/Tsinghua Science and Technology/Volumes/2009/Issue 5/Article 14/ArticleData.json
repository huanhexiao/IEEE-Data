The goal is a better understanding of the electrical and electrochemical processes when accounting for the characteristic cell voltage response during transients. The analysis and experiment are based on a low pressure 5 kW proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stack, which is similar to those used in several of Tsinghua's fuel cell buses. The experimental results provide an effective improvement reference for the power train control scheme of the fuel cell buses in Olympic demonstration in Beijing 2008.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "639", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "645", "date_publication": "Oct. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "639 - 645"}, "authors": ["Jianfeng Hua", "Liangfei Xu", "Xinfan Lin", "Minggao Ouyang"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Fuel cells", "Integrated circuit modeling", "Load modeling", "Mathematical model", "Resistance", "Transient analysis", "automotive applications", "fuel cell modeling", "proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell", "transient response", ""], "arnumber": "6076264"}
