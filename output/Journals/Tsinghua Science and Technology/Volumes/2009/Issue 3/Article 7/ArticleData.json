A weak form quadrature element method (QEM) is used for the vibration analysis. The fundamental frequencies of beams are presented for various slenderness ratios and nonlinear foundation parameters for both slender and short beams. The results for slender beams compare well with finite element results. The analysis shows that the transverse shear deformation and the nonlinear foundation parameter significantly affect the fundamental frequency of the beams.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "322", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "326", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "322 - 326"}, "authors": ["Yihua Mo", "Li Ou", "Hongzhi Zhong"], "keywords": ["Computers", "Convergence", "Educational institutions", "Finite element methods", "Strain", "Strontium", "Vibrations", "Timoshenko beam", "nonlinear foundation", "vibration", "weak form quadrature element method (QEM)", ""], "arnumber": "6074858"}
