Welding of this alloy is an indispensable processing method, so the microstructures and mechanical properties of these welded joints must be studied to improve the welds. Longitudinal three-point bending tests were conducted to measure the bending ductility of laser beam welded joints. The crack distribution and fracture surface were investigated to further analyze the fracture behavior. The results indicate that the bending ductility decreases as the heat input by the laser beam welding increases. The crack inducing strain reaches 4.24%, while the fracturing strain exceeds 5% when the heat input is below 316 J/cm. If the columnar crystal grain of the weld metal exhibits a uniform orientation, the bending ductility is worse. The fractography analysis shows that the cracking propagates transgranularly and the fracture surface has a cleavage mode.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "293", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "299", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "293 - 299"}, "authors": ["Guoqing Wang", "Aiping Wu", "Guisheng Zou", "Yue Zhao", "Qiang Chen", "Jialie Ren"], "keywords": ["Heating", "Joints", "Laser beams", "Metals", "Strain", "Surface cracks", "Welding", "Ti<inf>3</inf>AI alloy", "bending test", "fracture behavior", "laser beam welding joint", ""], "arnumber": "6074854"}
