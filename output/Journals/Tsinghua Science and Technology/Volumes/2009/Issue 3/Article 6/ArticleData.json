This paper summarizes methods developed to process muon radiography in Tsinghua University. The methods include detector data correction, reconstruction algorithms (maximum likelihood scattering, MLS, and the maximum likelihood scattering and displacement, MLSD) acceleration, and the modification of the normalized mean absolute distance measure (NMADM) into a picture comparison binarization method (PCBM) which is more suitable for cosmic ray muon radiographs. Simulations demonstrate that all these methods give excellent results, so that cosmic muon radiography can become more widely used.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "313", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "321", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "313 - 321"}, "authors": ["Yuanyuan Liu", "Zhiqiang Chen", "Ziran Zhao", "Li Zhang", "Zhentian Wang"], "keywords": ["Detectors", "Materials", "Maximum likelihood detection", "Mesons", "Phantoms", "Radiography", "Scattering", "data correction", "muon radiography", "picture comparison", "reconstruction algorithm", "simulation", ""], "arnumber": "6074857"}
