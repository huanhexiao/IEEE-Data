Simulations using VISSIM provided estimates of capacity distributions, and demonstrated the effects of the analysis intervals on the distributions. With the random vehicle arrivals taken into account, a capacity reliability assessment method was given as a function. Assessments were also performed regarding the effects of the conflicting pedestrian and bicycle volumes on capacity reliability. The simulation indicates that the pedestrians and bicycles result in greater random fluctuations of exclusive turning lane capacities, but have less effect on the variability of shared lane capacities. Normal distributions can be used to model the capacities for intervals not less than 10 min. At higher vehicular volumes, the capacity reliability is more sensitive to the mean and standard deviation of the pedestrian and bicycle volumes.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "333", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "340", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "333 - 340"}, "authors": ["Xiaoming Chen", "Chunfu Shao", "Da Li", "Chunjiao Dong"], "keywords": ["Bicycles", "Capacity planning", "Gaussian distribution", "Reliability", "Stochastic processes", "Weibull distribution", "capacity", "capacity distribution", "mixed traffic", "reliability", "signalized intersection", ""], "arnumber": "6074860"}
