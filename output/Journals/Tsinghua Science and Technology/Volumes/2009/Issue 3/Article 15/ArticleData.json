However, consumers from different countries demonstrate distinct purchasing behaviors online. This study uses eBay as the consumer-to-consumer electronic marketplace to investigate the eBay mechanisms and purchasing habits of consumers from the United States, France, and China to evaluate the effects of cultural and national differences on purchasing habits. This study uses data on national transactions and reputation profiles of sellers gathered from eBay.com, eBay.fr, and eBay.com.cn, including both cross-sectional data and panel data to provide a comprehensive comparison of cultural behavior in the trading process as well as the influence of eBay's reputation management system on online pricing in these three countries. Significant differences confirm that purchasing behavior differs in various national consumer-to-consumer electronic marketplaces and the importance of cultural behavioral patterns.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "383", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "389", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "383 - 389"}, "authors": ["Yan Zhu", "Yan Li", "Mathieu Leboulanqer"], "keywords": ["Communities", "Correlation", "Cultural differences", "Internet", "Marketing and sales", "Portable media players", "auction", "consumer-to-consumer (C2C) electronic marketplace", "cross-cultural comparison", "eBay", "reputation system", ""], "arnumber": "6074866"}
