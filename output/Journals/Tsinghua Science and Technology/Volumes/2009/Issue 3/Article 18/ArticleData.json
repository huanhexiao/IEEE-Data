This paper presents a multi-agent model system for the VRPTW based on the internal behavior of agents and coordination among the agents. The system presents a formal view of coordination using the traditional contract-net protocol (CNP) that relies on the basic loop of agent behavior for order receiving, order announcement, bid calculation, and order scheduling followed by order execution. An improved CNP method based on a vehicle selection strategy is used to reduce the number of negotiations and the negotiation time. The model is validated using Solomon's benchmarks, with the results showing that the improved GNP uses only 30% as many negotiations and only 70% of the negotiation time of the traditional CNP.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "407", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "412", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "407 - 412"}, "authors": ["Zhenggang Dan", "Linning Cai", "Li Zheng"], "keywords": ["Benchmark testing", "Databases", "Multiagent systems", "Protocols", "Routing", "Vehicles", "improved contract-net protocol", "multi-agent system", "vehicle routing problem with time window", ""], "arnumber": "6074869"}
