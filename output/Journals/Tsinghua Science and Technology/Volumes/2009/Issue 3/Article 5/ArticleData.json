The stochastic nucleation, solute redistribution, and growth anisotropy effects were taken into account in the present model. The model was used to simulate the grain size of magnesium alloy AZ91D for various cooling rates during the solidification process. To quantitatively validate the current model, metallographic experiments were carried out on specimens obtained from sand mold AZ91D step castings. The metallographic results agree well with the prediction results. The current model can be used to accurately predict the grain sizes of cast AZ91D magnesium alloy.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "307", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "312", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "307 - 312"}, "authors": ["Liang Huo", "Bin Li", "Yufeng Shi", "Qingyan Xu", "Zhiqiang Han", "Baicheng Liu"], "keywords": ["Casting", "Grain size", "Magnesium", "Microstructure", "Solid modeling", "Solids", "AZ91D", "cellular automaton method", "magnesium alloy", "microstructure", "numerical simulation", ""], "arnumber": "6074856"}
