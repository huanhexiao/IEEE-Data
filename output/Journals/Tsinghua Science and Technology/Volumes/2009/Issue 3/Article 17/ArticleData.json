This study presents a tourist satisfaction model for a destination and explores the antecedents (tourist expectations, destination image, perceived quality, and perceived value) and the consequences (tourist complaints and tourist loyalty) of tourist satisfaction using Guilin for the case study. Structural equation modeling results support the tourist satisfaction model of tourist expectations, destination image, perceived quality, and perceived value as four key antecedents of tourist satisfaction, with tourist satisfaction having a negative effect on tourist complaints and a positive effect on tourist loyalty. Managerial implications are drawn from the study findings and suggestions are given for future work.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "397", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "406", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "397 - 406"}, "authors": ["Xia Wang", "Jie Zhang", "Chaolin Gu", "Feng Zhen"], "keywords": ["Current measurement", "Educational institutions", "Equations", "Mathematical model", "Reliability", "Sun", "Time measurement", "Guilin", "destination", "structural equation modeling (SEM)", "tourist satisfaction", ""], "arnumber": "6074868"}
