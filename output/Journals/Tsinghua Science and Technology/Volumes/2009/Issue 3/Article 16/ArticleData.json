This paper presents a statistical analysis combined with intuitive relationships between lifetime and wealth. Key properties of this relationship are given and then various copulas are analyzed to see whether they have these properties. Other advantages and disadvantages of these copulas for describing the dependence are stated. The results show that some copulas are not appropriate for relating lifetime and wealth, including the Gaussian family.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "390", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "396", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "390 - 396"}, "authors": ["Dongyan Ye"], "keywords": ["Correlation", "Educational institutions", "Finance", "Industries", "Insurance", "Investments", "Probability density function", "copula", "dependence", "lifetime", "mortality rate", "wealth", ""], "arnumber": "6074867"}
