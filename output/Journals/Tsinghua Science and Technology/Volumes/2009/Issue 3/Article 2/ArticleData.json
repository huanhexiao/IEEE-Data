The position synchronization error on each axis was defined as the position difference between this axis and the following axes. The following error of each axis, the synchronization error, and its derivative were considered in the cost function. A Riccati equation was deduced from the Hamilton-Pontryagin equation. The optimal control law was set up from the Riccati equation solution. Simulations of a two-axis system show that the synchronization error can be significantly reduced and the synchronization performance can be adjusted based on the parameters in the cost function.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "287", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "292", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "287 - 292"}, "authors": ["Chunhong Wang", "Jinchun Hu", "Yu Zhu", "Wensheng Yin"], "keywords": ["Force", "Mathematical model", "Semiconductor device modeling", "Synchronization", "Synchronous motors", "Trajectory", "Vectors", "cross-coupling", "motion control", "optimal control", "synchronized scan", ""], "arnumber": "6074853"}
