In boundary contour splicing, the Delaunay triangulation algorithm can generate long, narrow triangles or radial shapes and with end contour closure, the Delaunay triangulation based on the determination of the convex-concave vertices tends to generate long, narrow triangles and triangles whose sizes differ greatly, and in some cases failure. This paper presents a Delaunay triangulation algorithm based on the shortest distance first principle for boundary contour splicing and an improved algorithm which combines Delaunay triangulation based on the determination of convex-concave vertices with interpolation for end contour closure. The results show that the algorithms retain the original advantages of the algorithms while increasing the triangulation effectiveness and enhancing the universality of the algorithms.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "38", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "42", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "38 - 42"}, "authors": ["Xiaodong Yang", "Peng Liu"], "keywords": ["Computed tomography", "Computers", "Image reconstruction", "Interpolation", "Reverse engineering", "Splicing", "Surface reconstruction", "Delaunay triangulation", "boundary contour", "computed tomography (CT) data", "end contour", "surface reconstruction", ""], "arnumber": "6075764"}
