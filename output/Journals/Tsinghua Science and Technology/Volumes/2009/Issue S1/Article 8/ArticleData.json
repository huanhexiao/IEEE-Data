The dimensional parameters associated with cutting tools need to be estimated and compared to the desired values for determining their cutting performance. In this paper, a data analysis methodology for extracting parameters from a measured point set corresponding to the surface of a cutting tool is provided. We propose that the 3-D data can be simplified into 2-D data or regular data by virtually slicing it at a predetermined section or by projecting it onto a same axial plane after a simple fixed-axis rotation. A plurality of curves can be generated and optimized based on the obtained 2-D points on a cross section for calculating the section parameters, including radial (axial) rake angle, relief angle, and land width. Other dimensional parameters can also be extracted from the contour of the presented rotary axial projection data. The experimental results have shown that the approaches elaborated in this paper are effective and robust, which can be potentially extended to other applications such as the inspection of similar parts and their parameters extraction.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "47", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "55", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "47 - 55"}, "authors": ["Tian Chen", "Xiaoming Du", "Jianming Zheng", "Xinjue Zou"], "keywords": ["Curve fitting", "Cutting tools", "Data mining", "Feature extraction", "Fitting", "Machining", "Parameter extraction", "cutting tool", "digital geometry processing", "parameter extraction", "reverse engineering", ""], "arnumber": "6075766"}
