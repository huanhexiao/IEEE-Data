CAE simulation softwares, in particular, MoldFlow, are used to get wax injection moulding parameters such as filling parameters, temperature profiles, freeze time, speed, and pressure. The results of this research were compared with conventional wax model production methods. The criteria of such comparison were based upon parameters such as time, cost, and other related characteristics, which resulted in saving of 50% in time and 60% in cost. In this research, design, assembly, and wax injection operation of the wax tool took 10 days. Considering the fact that wax melting temperature is as low as 70\u00b0C and injection pressure of 0.5 MPa, the tool suffers no damage due to the thermal and pressure stresses, leading to the mass production of wax models.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "108", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "115", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "108 - 115"}, "authors": ["Sadegh Rahmati", "Mohamad Reza Rezaei", "Javad Akbari"], "keywords": ["Biological system modeling", "Casting", "Injection molding", "Solid modeling", "Steel", "Stereolithography", "investment casting", "rapid prototyping", "rapid tooling", "simulation", "stereolithography", "wax injection moulding", ""], "arnumber": "6075776"}
