The design and manufacturing process of a pneumatic thrust bearing is described, and a special tessellation method is developed to further improve the capability of the manufacturing system thus bigger products can also be easily manufactured. Implemented in a layer-by-Iayer fashion, stereolithography has been used for the rapid manufacturing of complex devices, and it avoids the expensive assembly process in the traditional manufacturing. This paper presents that microstereolithography can produce high-resolution products with intricate details, small openings, and smooth surfaces. The potential of the microstereolithograhy technique is explored for the rapid manufacturing of small and complex objects.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "164", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "167", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "164 - 167"}, "authors": ["Hongyi Yang", "Svetan Ratchev", "Michele Turitto", "Joel Segal"], "keywords": ["Assembly", "Lithography", "Micromechanical devices", "Microstructure", "Prototypes", "Resins", "micro devices", "microstereolithography", "precision engineering", ""], "arnumber": "6075786"}
