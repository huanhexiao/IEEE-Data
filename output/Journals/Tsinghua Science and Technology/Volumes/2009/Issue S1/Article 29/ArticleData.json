In this work, an alumina-polymer paste with a relatively high volatility solvent (propanol) was used and the characteristics of the ceramic paste, particularly the rheological features are described. The advantage of high volatility solvent is that the viscosity and elastic modulus of the paste are increased sharply as the solvent evaporates. Thus, the rigidity of the extruded filament is quickly increased as a small amount of solvent evaporates. Finally, by employing this procedure, different EBG structures such as 2-D, 3-D woodpile and aperiodic structures were fabricated and their bandgaps were measured. The experimental results show that extrusion freeforming is a relatively simple and easy method to fabricate these woodpile structures with a bandgap in the 90\u2013110 GHz region.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "168", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "174", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "168 - 174"}, "authors": ["Xuesong Lu", "Yoonjae Lee", "Shoufeng Yang", "Yang Hao", "Julian R G Evans", "Clive Gt Parini"], "keywords": ["Frequency measurement", "Metamaterials", "Photonic band gap", "Solvents", "Stress", "Viscosity", "electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) crystal", "extrusion freeforming", "paste", "rheology", ""], "arnumber": "6075787"}
