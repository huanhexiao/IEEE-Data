Because it can simplify technical process and shorten molding cycles, electroforming is also a rapid manufacturing technology. Compared with direct and unipolar pulse current, bipolar pulse current in electroforming can obtain fine structure and grain size as well as surface leveling, resulting in better precision and surface finish. In this paper, bipolar pulse current electroforming is introduced. The influencing parameters such as electrolyte parameter, additives, current density, pH, temperature, and pulse parameters have been studied by experiments. Experiments on nickel electroforming in molds and dies have been done. The results indicated that bipolar pulse current electroforming could improve the quality and precision further, while reducing internal stress.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "144", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "148", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "144 - 148"}, "authors": ["Hongyou Li", "Kaiyong Jiang", "Yinbiao Guo", "Yunfeng Peng"], "keywords": ["Current density", "Manufacturing", "Nickel", "Optical pulses", "Surface topography", "Surface treatment", "bipolar pulse current", "electroforming", "molds and dies", "precision manufacturing", ""], "arnumber": "6075782"}
