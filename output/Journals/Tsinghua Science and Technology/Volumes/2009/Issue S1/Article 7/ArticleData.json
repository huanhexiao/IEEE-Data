A new surface reconstruction algorithm for slicing point cloud was presented. The contours of slice were extracted. Then, the intersection of two adjacent curve segments in the contour was obtained and curves feature was extracted. Finally, adjacent section contours were matched directly with Fourier-Mellin curve matching method for feature extraction. An example of 3-D model reconstruction shows the reliability and application of the algorithm.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "43", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "46", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "43 - 46"}, "authors": ["Gensong Zhu", "Tianrui Zhou", "Jie Zhou"], "keywords": ["Curve fitting", "Educational institutions", "Feature extraction", "Image reconstruction", "Reverse engineering", "Solid modeling", "Surface reconstruction", "curve reconstruction", "feature matching", "feature recognition", "reverse engineering", "slice", ""], "arnumber": "6075765"}
