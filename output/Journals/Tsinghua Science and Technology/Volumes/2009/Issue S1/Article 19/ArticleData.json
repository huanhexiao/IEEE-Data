Rapid prototyping (RP) uses layer-manufacturing strategies to create physical objects and has the advantage on scaffold fabrication. A new RP technology called aerodynamically assisted tip-pen direct writing was developed to construct the complex architectures. Compared with the traditional nozzle, the new nozzle has a micro-tip in the center of the micro-hole. The flow is determined by the gap between the micro-hole and micro-tip, which makes it practical for more accurate flow control. A highly accurate three-dimensional (3-D) micro-positioning system was employed with the new nozzle to deposit maltose structures. 3-D architectures had been made by this method, the width of fiber in which is about 120 urn. The results show that this method provides a possibility to construct 3-D scaffolds with tissue-scale features (i.e., 10\u2013100 \u03bcm) without bad influence on the biological activities.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "116", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "119", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "116 - 119"}, "authors": ["Feng Liu", "Renji Zhang"], "keywords": ["Fabrication", "Polymers", "Shape", "Substrates", "Tissue engineering", "Writing", "micro fabrication", "rapid prototyping", "scaffold", "tip-pen direct writing", ""], "arnumber": "6075777"}
