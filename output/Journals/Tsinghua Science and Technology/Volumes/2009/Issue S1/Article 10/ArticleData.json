In this work, a rapid human expression measurement system based on a digital fringe projection and phase-shift technique is developed. The measurement system consists of a digital light processing (OLP) projector and a high-speed change-coupled device (CCD) camera. The OLP projector is used to project computer-generated fringe patterns onto the human face, and the high-speed CCO camera synchronized with the projector acquires the fringe images at a frame rate of 30 frames/so Based on a three-step phase-shifting method and an accurate phase-height mapping algorithm, each frame of the 3-D human expression can be reconstructed. The principle of the proposed method is described and some experimental results are presented to demonstrate its performance. The experiment results show that the measurement system can reconstruct accurate 3-D human expression. An obvious merit of this method is that it can reconstruct the 3-D human expression in a very short time and it is not sensitive to the movement of the face during the measurement processing.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "62", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "65", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "62 - 65"}, "authors": ["Gang Zhou", "Zhongwei Li", "Congjun Wang", "Yusheng Shi"], "keywords": ["Cameras", "Charge coupled devices", "Face", "Humans", "Image reconstruction", "Optimized production technology", "Phase measurement", "digital fringe projection", "human expression reconstruction", "phase-shifting", ""], "arnumber": "6075768"}
