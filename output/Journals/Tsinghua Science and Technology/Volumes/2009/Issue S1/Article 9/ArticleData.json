Based on projections of point cloud slicing that correspond to template sectional curves, the method constructs topological relevant information among discrete points, which makes unorganized points ordering and builds up optimal approximated B-spline curve, resamples every curve according to its curvature distribution and performes triangular mesh division on it. Finally, surface reconstruction is achieved. The experimental results demonstrate that the surface reconstruction is done as the point cloud hole is filled simultaneously.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "56", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "61", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "56 - 61"}, "authors": ["Bin Liu", "Ning Shangguan", "Kaiyong Jiang", "Junyi Lin"], "keywords": ["Arrays", "Computational modeling", "Data models", "Reconstruction algorithms", "Solid modeling", "Spline", "Surface reconstruction", "point cloud slicing", "reverse engineering", "surface reconstruction", "template", ""], "arnumber": "6075767"}
