Since many flaws appear in most stereo lithography (STL) models, this algorithm utilizes slice data as input. A top-down approach was used to calculate the support slice layer by layer. The generation algorithm was described in detail including the slice grouping, oriental bounding box (OBB) calculation, offsetting, and Boolean operations. Several cases are given to validate the efficiency and robustness of the procedure. The algorithm provides necessary support not only for hanging surface but also for hanging vertexes and edges with O(n)time complexity, where nis the number of layers. The algorithm fully utilizes the parts' self-support ability and reduces support volume to the maximum extent. This slice data based algorithm has the same efficiency as the STL based algorithm but is more stable, which significantly enhances the robustness of the support generation process.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "223", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "228", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "223 - 228"}, "authors": ["Xiaomao Huang", "Chunsheng Ye", "Jianhua Mo", "Haitao Liu"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Data models", "Design automation", "Engines", "Software algorithms", "Solid modeling", "Transmission line matrix methods", "fused deposition modeling", "rapid prototype manufacturing (RPM)", "support slice data", ""], "arnumber": "6075796"}
