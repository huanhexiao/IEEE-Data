Three-dimensional printing (3DP) is one of such technologies that employ ink-jet printing technology for processing powder materials. During fabrication, a printer head is used to print a liquid on to thin layers of powder following the object's profile as generated by the system computer. This work looks at redesigning 3DP machine, using piezoelectric demand-mode technology head in order to improve accuracy, surface finishing and color quality of constructed models. The layers created with aforesaid system are between 25 to 150 \u03bcm(steps of 25 \u03bcm).", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "24", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "24 - 28"}, "authors": ["Sadegh Rahmati", "Farid Shirazi", "Hesam Baghayeri"], "keywords": ["Magnetic heads", "Powders", "Printing", "Solid modeling", "Viscosity", "piezoelectric head", "prototyping", "three-dimensional printing (3DP)", ""], "arnumber": "6075762"}
