The photonic crystals with a diamond structure composed of acrylic lattice with nanosized alumina particles were fabricated. Dense alumina structures were obtained by successive dewaxing and sintering in an air atmosphere. The electromagnetic wave properties of these samples were measured by using a terahertz spectroscopy device. The micro periodic structures exhibited perfect band gaps in the terahertz range. To control terahertz waves, micrometer sized electromagnetic devices for cavities, filters, and antennas will be necessary.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "160", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "163", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "160 - 163"}, "authors": ["Soshu Kirihara", "Daisuke Sanot", "Masaru Kaneko"], "keywords": ["Diamond-like carbon", "Dielectrics", "Electromagnetic scattering", "Lattices", "Photonic band gap", "band gap", "diamond photonic crystal", "micro-stereolithography", "terahertz wave", ""], "arnumber": "6075785"}
