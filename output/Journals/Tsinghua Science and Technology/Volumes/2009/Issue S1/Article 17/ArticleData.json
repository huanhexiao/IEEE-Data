Total quality manufacturing (TOM) is only possible if mechanical properties are well known in the design stage depending on the processing parameters. This work is mainly focused on testing of several samples made with different selective laser sintering (SLS) parameters and technologies. This procedure is the starting point to establish a basis for designing for RM and the standardization of RM testing. The experiments and the analysis of variance (ANOVA) analyzed the effects of several factors on mechanical properties. The SLS technologies were 3DSystem and EOS. The results show which factor has a large effect on the variables and the interaction between them. The conclusions are very useful for developing rules for designing (designing for RM) and creating new standard rules (ISO, AISI, and DIN) for RM materials and parts testing. The ANOVA gives a better knowledge of the effects of these factors and eliminates unimportant parameters.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "100", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "107", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "100 - 107"}, "authors": ["Mario Monzon", "Pedro M Hernandez", "Antonio N Benftez", "Marfa D Marrero", "Angel Fernandez"], "keywords": ["Analysis of variance", "Earth Observing System", "Mechanical factors", "Plastics", "Power lasers", "Testing", "additive manufacturing", "analysis of variance (ANOVA)", "laser sintering", "rapid manufacturing (RM)", "rapid prototyping", "selective laser sintering (SLS)", ""], "arnumber": "6075775"}
