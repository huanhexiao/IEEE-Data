It is based on an advanced dispersed-accumulated forming principle and originated from 1980s. It generates an entity by first forming a series of layers according to the dispersed section information of the digital model, and then piling the formed layers sequentially together. It is capable of forming parts with complicated structures and non-homogeneous materials. Traditional RPM techniques are mainly used as prototypes in product invention process, such as stereolithography, three-dimensional printing, laminated object manufacturing, and fused deposition modeling. Later, with the progress of material and enabling technology, many new RPM techniques emerged out and have been already applied in the fields such as rapid tooling/moulding, direct formed usable part, nano-/micro-RPM, and biomanufacturing. This high flexible digital manufacturing method has a likely ability to become an almighty forming technology.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "12", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "1 - 12"}, "authors": ["Yongnian Yan", "Shengjie Li", "Renji Zhang", "Feng Lin", "Rendong Wu", "Qingping Lu", "Zhuo Xiong", "Xiaohong Wang"], "keywords": ["Laser beams", "Laser sintering", "Manufacturing", "Powders", "Resins", "Solid modeling", "biomanufacturing", "dispersed-accumulated forming", "rapid manufacturing", "rapid moulding", "rapid prototyping", "rapid tooling", ""], "arnumber": "6075759"}
