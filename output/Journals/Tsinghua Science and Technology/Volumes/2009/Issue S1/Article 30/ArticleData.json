The two different kinds of jetting device and their control circuits are designed based on which the relationship between the jetting system and amount of the catalyst flow is analyzed. The experiments show that the amount of the catalyst by using discrete jetting mode in the discrete jetting device is much lower than that by using continuous jetting mode in the discrete jetting device and in the continuous device when the pressured is fixed. At the same time, in the discrete jetting mode the amount of the catalyst flow can also be changed by adjusting the pulse frequency and its duty cycle, this can ensure the strength of the sand mould. The flow of catalyst in this discrete jetting device can match the scanning speed of the jetting device in real time which will improve the resolution and building precision of casting mould. When the amount of the catalyst jetting is too large, PCM process will fail.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "175", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "179", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "175 - 179"}, "authors": ["Li Jiong", "Yang Weidong", "Liu Libing", "Yan Yongnian"], "keywords": ["Buildings", "Casting", "Coils", "Phase change materials", "Solenoids", "Valves", "continuous jetting", "discrete jetting", "flow", "patternless casting manufacturing (PCM)", "surface quality", ""], "arnumber": "6075788"}
