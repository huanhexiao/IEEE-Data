In this paper, various scan strategies, including iterative scan mode, reverse scan mode, interlaced reverse scan mode, randomized block scan mode, and constant length scan mode, are investigated. The analyses for each scan strategy are presented based on the influence to the temperature field over the formation zone and the powder pushed-away phenomena. The most promising strategy, interlaced reverse scan mode, is approved by the ANSYS simulation and a two-dimensional scan experiment. The result shows interlaced reverse scan mode can improve the uniformity of the temperature field and reduce the powder pushed-away phenomena.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "120", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "126", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "120 - 126"}, "authors": ["Wei Lu", "Feng Lin", "Jiandong Han", "Haibo Qi", "Naisheng Yan"], "keywords": ["Electron beams", "Filling", "Finite element methods", "Metals", "Powders", "Temperature distribution", "Temperature measurement", "electron beam selective melting", "powder pushed-away", "scan strategy", ""], "arnumber": "6075778"}
