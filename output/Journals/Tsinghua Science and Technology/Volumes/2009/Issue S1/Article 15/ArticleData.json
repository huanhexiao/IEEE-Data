In this algorithm, the coordinate information of nodes both in internal and external regions of partition interpolation was used to realize minimized least squares approximation error of surface fitting. The changes between internal and external interpolation regions are continuous and smooth. Meanwhile, surface shape has properties of local controllability, variation reduction, and convex hull. The practical example shows that this algorithm possesses a higher accuracy of curved surface reconstruction and also improves the distortion of curved surface reconstruction when typical approximating algorithms and unstable operation are used.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "89", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "93", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "89 - 93"}, "authors": ["Shan Zhong", "Xueyan Lu"], "keywords": ["Approximation algorithms", "Fascia", "Interpolation", "Mathematical model", "Surface reconstruction", "Surface treatment", "approximating algorithm", "points cloud data", "reconstruction of curved surface", ""], "arnumber": "6075773"}
