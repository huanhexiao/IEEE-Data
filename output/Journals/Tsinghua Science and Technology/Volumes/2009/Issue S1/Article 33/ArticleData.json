The system hardware is composed of a 5 kW CO2 laser, a three-dimensional numeric control table, a three-stock-bin coaxial powder delivery device, and an integration operation control desk. The system software is composed of the CAD slicing and scan filling module, materials component distributing design module, and hardware equipment integration drive module. The real time change proportion allocation technique of three metal powders, powder uniform mixing technique, and coaxial powder delivery technique are studied. According to the principle of the output powder cumulative volume invariable in unit time, the real time powder allocation formulae are deduced. The design method of the materials component distributing regularity in the part entity is studied. The gradient change regularity of the face gradient, line gradient, and point gradient is studied. A sort of the file layout of integrating material information and geometry information is brought forward.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "192", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "199", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "192 - 199"}, "authors": ["Wei Wang", "Xiaofeng Shang"], "keywords": ["Face", "Filling", "Lasers", "Materials", "Metals", "Multiprotocol label switching", "Powders", "functionally gradient material", "laser rapid prototyping", "metal powder laser shaping", "powder delivery device", ""], "arnumber": "6075791"}
