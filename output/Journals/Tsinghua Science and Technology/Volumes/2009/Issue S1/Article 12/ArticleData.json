Using ontology and object-oriented principle (OOP) together to cope with problems in modeling is brought forward in this paper. The two are widely used and do well in modeling, but they each alone cannot cope with all issues and new challenges. Three basic requests are pointed out in DPM modeling. Status, problems, and root of current non-semantic and semantic models are introduced. Ontology, OOP, and their difference are introduced. It is found that the two are entirely complementary with each other. How to assign the roles and to cooperate for the two in coping with the three basic issues in DPM modeling are explained in detail.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "71", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "76", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "71 - 76"}, "authors": ["Jingchang Shangguan", "Yan Yan", "Haitao Liu", "Guoxin Wang", "Bo Zhao"], "keywords": ["Adaptation models", "Computational modeling", "Computers", "Data models", "Object oriented modeling", "Ontologies", "Semantics", "data representation", "digital product model", "object-oriented principle", "ontology", "role assignment and cooperation", ""], "arnumber": "6075770"}
