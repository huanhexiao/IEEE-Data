The u-rnicro motor is fabricated by the micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) process, the structure design must be considered to fabricate or assembly the parts during machining the motor in the meantime. The research proved that integration of IC (integrated circuit) process and MEMS using masks is effective in obtaining the rapid prototyping manufacturing of the u-rnicro motor. With the mature technique to fabricate the motor, there are advantages to produce the motor in short time and with lower cost than before. The motor is a common power source of micro machines in military and civilian applications, for example, applied to micro robot, micro bio medicine, and micro machine. The size of the motor is 190 \u03bcm in maximum diameter by 125 \u03bcm in height that is bulk machined in array with the number of hundreds of micro motors on a substrate.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "149", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "153", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "149 - 153"}, "authors": ["Wei Zheng", "Hui Zheng", "Rui Liao"], "keywords": ["Educational institutions", "Machining", "Rotors", "Silicon", "Stators", "Surface treatment", "China", "advanced manufacturing technology, micro-/nano-technology", "micro electro-mechanical systems (MEMS)", "micro motor", "nontraditional machining", ""], "arnumber": "6075783"}
