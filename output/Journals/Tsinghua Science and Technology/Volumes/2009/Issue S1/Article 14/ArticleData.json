An arithmetic profile curve blending technique was used based on a well-proportioned points cloud data obtained by analyzing computer tomography (CT) images of the patients. This technique uses reverse engineering technique to reconstruct a model of the defective cranium, taking all the characteristics of the protruding cranium into consideration to check the form and appropriateness of the restoration and to adjust the surface in real time to obtain the ideal shape. Then, the model is transferred to a multiple-point forming (MPF) pressure machine to produce a titanium alloy restoration model. The system has greater flexibility, shorter production cycles, and lower cost through the use of digital production technology, guarantees the quality of the cranial defects restoration model, reduces the surgical risks, and alleviates the patients' pain. In addition, an improved contour curved bridge algorithm technique is used to repair any cranium defects on the contour curve to make the contour more complete and closed.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "82", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "88", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "82 - 88"}, "authors": ["Hongsheng Fu", "Liang Gao", "Luyue Ju", "Yuzhang Liu"], "keywords": ["Bridges", "Computed tomography", "Cranium", "Image edge detection", "Image restoration", "Solid modeling", "Surface reconstruction", "blending arithmetic", "computer tomography (CT)", "cranioplasty", "multiple point forming (MPF)", "reverse engineering", ""], "arnumber": "6075772"}
