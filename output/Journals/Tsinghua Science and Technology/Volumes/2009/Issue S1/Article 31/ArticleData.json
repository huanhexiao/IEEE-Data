This paper is to evaluate the dimensional accuracy of sand mould on PCM. The two important factors-the liquid penetration rule in the space of particles and the shape and dimension of the agglomeration unit body, which influence the process parameters such as scanning speed, layer thickness, liquid flux on dimension accuracy, and surface qualities, were investigated systematically, thus the theoretical basis for these parameters was provided. Experiments on rapid manufacturing of sand mould were carried out, and the results of the free penetration and the constraint penetration well verified the relationship of the two factors and the process parameters.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "180", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "185", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "180 - 185"}, "authors": ["Weidong Yang", "Yongnian Yan", "Renji Zhang", "Libing Liu"], "keywords": ["Arrays", "Casting", "Filling", "Permeability", "Phase change materials", "Shape", "Solid modeling", "agglomeration unit body", "patternless casting manufacturing", "penetration process", "permeability", "sand mould", "solidification", ""], "arnumber": "6075789"}
