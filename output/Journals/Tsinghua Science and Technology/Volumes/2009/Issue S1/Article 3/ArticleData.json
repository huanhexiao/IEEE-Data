A number of studies have shown that the bulk properties of such irregular structures are poorly modeled using idealized unit cell approaches. The paper therefore uses novel image based meshing techniques to explore both fluid flow and bulk structural properties of a bone scaffold, as accurate modeling of bio-scaffolds with non-uniform cellular structures is very important for the development of optimal scaffolds for tissue engineering application. In this study, a porous hydroxyapatiteltricalcium phosphate (HA/TCP) bone scaffold has been scanned in a Micro-CT scanner, and converted into a volumetric mesh using image processing software developed by the authors. The resulting mesh was then exported to commercial FEA and CFD solvers for analysis. Initial FEA and CFD studies have shown promising results and have highlighted the importance of accurate modeling to understand how microstructures influence the mechanical property of the scaffold, and to analyze flow regimes through the sample. The work highlights the potential use of image based meshing for the ad hoc characterization of scaffolds as well as for assisting in the design of scaffolds with tailored strength, stiffness, and transport properties.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "20", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "20 - 23"}, "authors": ["Zhiqanq Hu", "Bruno Notarberardino", "Matthew Baker", "Gavin Tabor", "Lianq Hao", "Irene Turner", "Lincoln Yang"], "keywords": ["Bones", "Computational fluid dynamics", "Computational modeling", "Educational institutions", "Finite element methods", "Load modeling", "Solid modeling", "bio-scaffolds", "computational fluid dynamics", "dynamics microstructures", "finite element", "material characterization", ""], "arnumber": "6075761"}
