The coaxial powder delivery system is the key technique. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new type of coaxial powder delivery system and simulate the metal powder and shield gas flow in the powder nozzle. 2-D and 3-D model of the new coaxial powder delivery system are established. Then gas-solid two-phase flow model and the k-\u220a turbulent model are selected to simulate the flow of metal powder in powder nozzle. The Euler-Lagrange method is used in the simulating computation. The results show that the new coaxial powder delivery system has stable performance, uniform powder flux, high cooling efficiency, and long useful life.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "200", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "205", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "200 - 205"}, "authors": ["Zhijian Wang", "Anna Zhang", "Xiaofeng Shang"], "keywords": ["Cavity resonators", "Equations", "Gas lasers", "Mathematical model", "Metals", "Powders", "Solid modeling", "coaxial powder delivery system", "laser rapid prototype", "numerical simulation", "pressure distribution", "velocity distribution", ""], "arnumber": "6075792"}
