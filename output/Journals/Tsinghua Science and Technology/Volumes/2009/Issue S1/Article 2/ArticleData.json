An extrusion device, inspired by the FDM process, was used to create scaffolds from a variety of different polymeric materials and mixtures. The effectiveness of these scaffolds to host cells for bone regeneration has been investigated. This ongoing work has generated significant insight into the future direction of research and the possibilities of developing scaffolds for medium/high load-bearing applications.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "19", "date_publication": "June 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "13 - 19"}, "authors": ["Ian Gibson", "Monica M Savalani", "X F Lam Christopher", "Radoslow Olkowski", "Andrew K Ekaputra", "Kim Chenq Tan", "Dietmar W Hutmacher"], "keywords": ["Bones", "Fabrication", "Frequency division multiplexing", "Materials", "Mechanical factors", "Microscopy", "Roads", "load-bearing bone engineering", "scaffolds", "tissue engineering", ""], "arnumber": "6075760"}
