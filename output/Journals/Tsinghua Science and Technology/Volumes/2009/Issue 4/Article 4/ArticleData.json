A composite controller was designed based on a singularly perturbed model of flexible-link manipulators when the rigid motion and flexible motion are decoupled. The NSMC is employed to control the slow subsystem to track a desired trajectory with a traditional sliding mode controller to stabilize the fast subsystem which represents the link vibrations. A stability analysis of the flexible modes is also given. Simulations confirm that the NSMC performs better than the traditional sliding-mode control for controlling flexible-link manipulators. The control strategy not only gives good tracking performance for the joint angle, but also effectively suppresses endpoint vibrations. The simulations also show that the control strategy has a strong self-adaptive ability for controlling manipulators with different parameters.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "444", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "451", "date_publication": "Aug. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "444 - 451"}, "authors": ["Yu Zhang", "Tangwen Yang", "Zengqi Sun"], "keywords": ["Artificial neural networks", "Computational modeling", "Control systems", "Joints", "Manipulator dynamics", "Torque", "flexible manipulators", "neuro-sliding-mode control", "singular perturbation", "sliding-mode control", ""], "arnumber": "6076232"}
