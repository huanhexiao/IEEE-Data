The antenna consists of a crescent-shaped elliptical patch with a T-shaped stub and a square ground board plane. The antenna is easily integrated with radio-frequency/microwave circuits to reduce the manufacturing cost. The central frequency and the notch bandwidth can be adjusted by changing the size of the T-shaped stub. Simulations verify the design characteristics. Measurements show that the antenna produces the UWB working bandwidth.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "460", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "464", "date_publication": "Aug. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "460 - 464"}, "authors": ["Shengcai Jiao", "Ning Ge", "Jianhua Lu", "Ming Jiang"], "keywords": ["Antenna measurements", "Antenna radiation patterns", "Bandwidth", "Ultra wideband antennas", "band-notched characteristics", "monopole antenna", "ultra wideband (UWB) antenna", ""], "arnumber": "6076234"}
