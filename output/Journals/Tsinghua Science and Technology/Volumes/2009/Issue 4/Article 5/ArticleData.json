A more practical attack model is introduced, and according to this model, an efficient certificateless encryption scheme is presented which is IND-CCA secure against both Type I and Type II attackers without random oracle. This encryption scheme can defend against the malicious key generation center attack, and can reach Girault's trusted level 3 as in traditional public key infrastructure-based cryptography. This certificateless encryption scheme has a shorter public key than other schemes in the standard model.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "452", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "459", "date_publication": "Aug. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "452 - 459"}, "authors": ["Guoyan Zhang", "Xiaoyun Wang"], "keywords": ["Computational modeling", "Educational institutions", "Encryption", "Generators", "Public key", "IND-CCA secure", "certificateless cryptography", "key replacement attack", "malicious key generation center", ""], "arnumber": "6076233"}
