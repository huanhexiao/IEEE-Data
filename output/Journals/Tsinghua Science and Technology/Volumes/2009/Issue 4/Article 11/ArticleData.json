An initial CFO estimate was first obtained based on the received training signals at each user's prescribed subcarrier positions. Then, the received training signals were compensated by using the initial CFO estimates in the frequency domain and the multi-user interferences were estimated. Finally, the interference-cancelled training signals were used to reliably estimate each user's CFO. The CFO estimator performance was evaluated by the bit error rate performances of the CFO compensation-based receivers at the base station. Simulations show that with this optimal interference-cancellation-based CFO compensation receiver, the performance gain with the estimated CFO values is approximately 3 dB better at the 0.1 % bit error rate than the initial CFO estimates.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "487", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "491", "date_publication": "Aug. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "487 - 491"}, "authors": ["Huan Su", "Chao Zhang", "Jianhua Lu"], "keywords": ["Base stations", "Bit error rate", "Frequency conversion", "Interference cancellation", "OFDM", "Receivers", "Training", "carrier frequency offset estimation", "compensation", "interference cancellation", "orthogonal frequency division multiplex access (OFDMA)", "uplink", ""], "arnumber": "6076239"}
