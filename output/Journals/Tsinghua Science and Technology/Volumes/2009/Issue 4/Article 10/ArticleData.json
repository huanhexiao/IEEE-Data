This paper presents a graph cuts algorithm to segment arbitrary skin regions from images. The detected face is used to determine the foreground skin seeds and the background non-skin seeds with the color probability distributions for the foreground represented by a single Gaussian model and for the background by a Gaussian mixture model. The probability distribution of the image is used for noise suppression to alleviate the influence of the background regions having skin-like colors. Finally, the skin is segmented by graph cuts, with the regional parameter \u03b3 optimally selected to adapt to different images. Tests of the algorithm on many real world photographs show that the scheme accurately segments skin regions and is robust against illumination variations, individual skin variations, and cluttered backgrounds.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "478", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "486", "date_publication": "Aug. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "478 - 486"}, "authors": ["Zhilan Hu", "Guijin Wang", "Xinggang Lin", "Hong Yan"], "keywords": ["Colored noise", "Face", "Image color analysis", "Image segmentation", "Lighting", "Skin", "Gaussian mixture model (GMM)", "graph cuts", "noise suppression", "skin segmentation", ""], "arnumber": "6076238"}
