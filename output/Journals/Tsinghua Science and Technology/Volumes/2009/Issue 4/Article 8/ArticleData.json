To apply the knowledge of DPLLs to the design of Kalman filters, this paper studies the steady-state performance of Kalman filters for these system models. The results show that the steady-state Kalman gain has the same form as the DPLL gain. An approximate simple form for the steady-state Kalman gain is used to derive an expression for the equivalent loop bandwidth of the Kalman filter as a function of the process and observation noise variances. These results can be used to analyze the steady-state performance of a Kalman filter with DPLL theory or to design a Kalman filter model with the same steady-state performance as a given DPLL.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "470", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "473", "date_publication": "Aug. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "470 - 473"}, "authors": ["Yi Qian", "Xiaowei Cui", "Mingquan Lu", "Zhenming Feng"], "keywords": ["Bandwidth", "Equations", "Gain", "Global Positioning System", "Kalman filters", "Noise", "Steady-state", "Kalman filter", "digital phase-locked loop (DPLL)", "steady-state performance", ""], "arnumber": "6076236"}
