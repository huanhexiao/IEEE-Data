The present study determined whether the cytosol adenylate kinase (AK) system was involved in the neuronal damage induced by long-term exposure to high corticosterone levels. We investigated the effects of long-term exposure to high corticosterone levels on AK1 activity, AK1 mRNA expression, and energy levels in cultured hippocampal neurons. The results show that long-term exposure to high corticosterone levels induces a reduction of the cultured hippocampal neuron viability, significantly reduces energy levels, and causes a time-dependant reduction of the AK1 activity. These findings indicate that changes in the AK system might be the mechanism underlying neuronal damage induced by long-term exposure to high corticosterone levels.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "519", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "527", "date_publication": "Aug. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "519 - 527"}, "authors": ["Yu'nan Zhao", "Jia Shen", "Hui Su", "Yufang Huang", "Dongming Xing", "Lijun Du"], "keywords": ["Analysis of variance", "Animals", "Educational institutions", "Laboratories", "Neurons", "Proteins", "adenine nucleotide", "adenylate kinase", "cell viability", "corticosterone", "neuron", ""], "arnumber": "6076243"}
