After the one-pot reacting process, the product was easily purified by washing with water. The polyaniline shell covering the polystyrene sphere surface was confirmed with FT-IR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The conductivity of the polyaniline-coated polystyrene particles was 0.0017 S/cm and increased to 0.1 S/cm after being doped in the Hel vapor. The morphology of the microspheres was characterized by TEM and SEM. The particles show a more uniform and smooth surface than previous particles.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "546", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "550", "date_publication": "Aug. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "546 - 550"}, "authors": ["Yi Yuan", "Yanqing Lian"], "keywords": ["Chemicals", "Color", "Conductivity", "Plastics", "Polymers", "Surface morphology", "Surface treatment", "core/shell structure", "microspheres", "polyaniline", ""], "arnumber": "6076247"}
