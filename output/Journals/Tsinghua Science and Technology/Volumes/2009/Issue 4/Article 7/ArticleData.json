Gnutella-like P2P networks are complex heterogeneous networks, in which the underlying overlay topology has a power-law node degree distribution. While scale-free networks have great robustness against random failures, they are vulnerable to deliberate attacks where highly connected nodes are eliminated. Since high degree nodes play an important role in maintaining the connectivity, this paper presents an algorithm based on random walks to locate high degree nodes in P2P networks. Simulations demonstrate that the algorithm performs well in various scenarios and that heterogeneous P2P networks are very sensitive to deliberate attacks.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "465", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "469", "date_publication": "Aug. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "465 - 469"}, "authors": ["Haoxiang Zhang", "Lin Zhang", "Xiuming Shan", "Victor O.
