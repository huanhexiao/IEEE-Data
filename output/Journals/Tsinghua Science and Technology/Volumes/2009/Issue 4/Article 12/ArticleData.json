Service-oriented enterprise (SOE) networks (SOEN) are emerging with the significant advances of EI, SOA, and MDA. However, the implementation and optimization of SOEN is still lacking integrated SOA, MDA, and performance analysis and optimization (PAO) methods. This paper introduces an integrated solution of SOA and MDA with a simulation-based three-stage PAO method with stage 1 being an analytic hierarchy process (AHP)-based comprehensive performance calculation for service matching and binding, stage 2 being a simulation-based comprehensive performance evaluation for business process/service composition, and stage 3 being a business process simulation-based performance optimization for SOEN. The SOE architecture, performance analysis framework, performance indicators, and performance operators are discussed. The system uses MDA as the system development philosophy, SOA as the system implementation infrastructure, and the simulation-based PAO methods to analyze and optimize the SOEN performance. A case study of the SOEN illustrates the usage of the integrated solution.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "492", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "503", "date_publication": "Aug. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "492 - 503"}, "authors": ["Sen Zeng", "Shuangxi Huang", "Yushun Fan"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Business", "Computer architecture", "Data models", "Optimization", "Performance analysis", "Service oriented architecture", "analytic hierarchy process (AHP)", "performance analysis", "service-oriented architecture (SOA)", "service-oriented business process (SOBP)", "service-oriented enterprise (SOE)", "simulation optimization", ""], "arnumber": "6076240"}
