This paper presents a depth-first construction algorithm to obtain simple B\u03cbehl automata from linear-time temporal logic which significantly reduces the sizes of the state spaces. A form-filling algorithm was used to reduce the size of the generated automata and the algorithms were applied directly to state-based B\u03cbehl automata, without transformation into transition-based automata. A form-filling algorithm for the B\u03cbehl automata, which is based on the form-filling algorithm for deterministic automata, was developed by redefining parts of the configuration of the B\u03cbehl automata as well as the transition function. The correctness of this form-filling algorithm was proven. Tests show that this approach is competitive, especially on LTL formulae in the form of G, F, and U.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "75", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "82", "date_publication": "Feb. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "75 - 82"}, "authors": ["Chongyuan Yinn", "Guiming Luo"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Automata", "Barium", "Doped fiber amplifiers", "Information science", "Redundancy", "Symmetric matrices", "B&#x00FC", "chi automata", "form-filling algorithm", "linear temporal logic", "state-based B&#x00FC", "chi automata", ""], "arnumber": "6073162"}
