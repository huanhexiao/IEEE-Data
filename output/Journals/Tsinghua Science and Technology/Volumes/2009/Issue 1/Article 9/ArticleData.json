This paper properly models the 3-D thick mask effects, and then analyses the object-based inverse lithography technique using a simulated annealing algorithm to determine the mask shapes that produce the desired on-wafer results. Evaluations against rigorous simulations show that the synthesized masks provide good image fidelity up to 0.94, and this approach gives improved accuracy and faster results than existing methods.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "68", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "74", "date_publication": "Feb. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "68 - 74"}, "authors": ["Wei Xiong", "Jinyu Zhang", "Min-Chun Tsai", "Yan Wang", "Zhiping Yu"], "keywords": ["Approximation methods", "Lithography", "Mathematical model", "Semiconductor device modeling", "Simulated annealing", "Solid modeling", "3-D mask effect", "inverse lithography technique (ILT)", "simulated annealing", ""], "arnumber": "6073161"}
