The DES is universal in the sense that operations on all sensors are identical and independent of noise distribution. The scheme requires each sensor to transmit just a 1-bit message per observation. Simulation results show that the scheme achieves much better mean-squares error (MSE) performance than the simplified isotropic universal DES and even outperforms the isotropic universal DES which requires more than twice the bandwidth of this scheme.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "121", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "125", "date_publication": "Feb. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "121 - 125"}, "authors": ["Li Zhang", "Xianda Zhang", "Qiubin Gao"], "keywords": ["Ad hoc networks", "Bandwidth", "Estimation", "Noise", "Quantization", "Upper bound", "Wireless sensor networks", "distributed estimation", "distributed signal processing", "quantization", "sensor networks", ""], "arnumber": "6073169"}
