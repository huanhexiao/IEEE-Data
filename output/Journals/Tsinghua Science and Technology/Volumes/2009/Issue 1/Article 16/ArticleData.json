This study assumes that this high-dimensionality problem is related to the redundancy in the term set, which cannot be solved by traditional term selection methods. A greedy algorithm framework named \u201cnon-independent term selection\u201d is presented, which reduces the redundancy according to string-level correlations. Several preliminary implementations of this idea are demonstrated. Experiment results show that a good tradeoff can be reached between the performance and the size of the term set.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "113", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "120", "date_publication": "Feb. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "113 - 120"}, "authors": ["Jingyang Li", "Maosong Sun"], "keywords": ["Cancer", "Classification algorithms", "Indexing", "Machine learning", "Semantics", "Text categorization", "Vectors", "Chinese text categorization", "dimentionality", "term selection", ""], "arnumber": "6073168"}
