This reduces the cost during the abstraction period relative to models requiring many useless states. A dining-philosophers example comparing this abstraction method with conventional methods indicates that a large proportion of the state space has been reduced by this abstraction method. Finally, the abstract method is shown to be correct and an analysis is given to show how such a large proportion of states can be reduced.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "90", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "94", "date_publication": "Feb. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "90 - 94"}, "authors": ["Junbo Sun", "Guiming Luo"], "keywords": ["Automata", "Computational modeling", "Educational institutions", "Information science", "Software", "Solid modeling", "Sun", "B&#x03CB", "chi automaton", "abstraction", "explicit model checking", "linear temporal logic", ""], "arnumber": "6073164"}
