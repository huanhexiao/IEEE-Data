Powerful error-correcting codes must be used with OFDM. This paper presents a quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (LDPC) coded OFDM system, in which the redundant bits of each codeword are mapped to a higher-order modulation constellation. The optimal degree distribution was calculated using density evolution. The corresponding quasi-cyclic LDPC code was then constructed using circulant permutation matrices. Group shuffled message passing scheduling was used in the iterative decoding. Simulation results show that the system achieves better error rate performance and faster decoding convergence than conventional approaches on both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "106", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "112", "date_publication": "Feb. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "106 - 112"}, "authors": ["Binbin Liu", "Dong Bai", "Qihong Ge", "Shunliang Mel"], "keywords": ["Decoding", "Iterative decoding", "Manganese", "Modulation", "Noise", "OFDM", "code design", "degree distribution", "density evolution", "iterative decoding", "quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes", ""], "arnumber": "6073167"}
