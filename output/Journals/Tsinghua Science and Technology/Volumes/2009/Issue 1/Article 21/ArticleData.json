This paper proposes a blind CFO estimation method based on power spectrum analysis, which has high bandwidth efficiency and is much less complex. This method can be used to estimate the residual CFO, which is less than half of the subcarrier spacing. The method uses a cosine cost function to get a closed-form CFO estimate. Simulation results illustrate that the method is effective for MIMO OFDM systems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "146", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "150", "date_publication": "Feb. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "146 - 150"}, "authors": ["Lu Wu", "Xianda Zhang"], "keywords": ["Estimation", "Frequency division multiplexing", "Frequency estimation", "MIMO", "OFDM", "Spectral analysis", "Transmitting antennas", "carrier frequency offset (CFO)", "multi-input multi-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO OFDM)", "power spectrum analysis (PSA)", ""], "arnumber": "6073173"}
