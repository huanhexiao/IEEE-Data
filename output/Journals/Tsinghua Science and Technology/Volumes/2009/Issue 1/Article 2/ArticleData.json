The method divides an XML document into compact connected integral subtrees, called self-integral trees (SI-Trees), to capture the structural information in the XML document. The SI-Trees are generated based on a schema guide. Meaningful self-integral trees (MSI-Trees) are identified, which contain all or some of the input keywords for the keyword search in the XML documents. Indexing is used to accelerate the retrieval of MSI-Trees related to the input keywords. The MSI-Trees are ranked to identify the top-k results with the highest ranks. Extensive tests demonstrate that this method costs 10\u2013100 ms to answer a keyword query, and outperforms existing approaches by 1\u20132 orders of magnitude.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "7", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "Feb. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "7 - 18"}, "authors": ["Guoliang Li", "Jianhua Feng", "Lizhu Zhou"], "keywords": ["Acceleration", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Indexes", "Keyword search", "Relational databases", "XML", "extensive markup language (XML)", "indexing", "keyword searches", "ranking", "self-integral trees", ""], "arnumber": "6073154"}
