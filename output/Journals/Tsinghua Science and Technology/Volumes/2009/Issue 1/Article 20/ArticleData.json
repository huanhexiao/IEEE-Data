The NAM representation algorithm is compared with the popular linear quadtree and run length encoding algorithms. Theoretical and experimental results show that the algorithm has a higher compression ratio for both lossy and loss less cases of binary images and better reconstructed quality for the lossy case.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "139", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "145", "date_publication": "Feb. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "139 - 145"}, "authors": ["Yunping Zheng", "Chuanbo Chen", "Mudar Sarem"], "keywords": ["Complexity theory", "Data compression", "Encoding", "Image coding", "Image reconstruction", "Image segmentation", "Transforms", "binary image", "image compression", "image representation", "linear quadtree", "run length encoding", ""], "arnumber": "6073172"}
