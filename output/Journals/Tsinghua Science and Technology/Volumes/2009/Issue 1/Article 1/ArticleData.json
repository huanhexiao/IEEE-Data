However, there is no rigorous analytical theory for this type of antenna. This paper analyzed the metal parts of a tapered slot antenna in a conical coordinate system with the medium analyzed in rectangular coordinates. This mixed mode gave an approximate analytical form for the tapered slot antenna with the field distribution and radiation characteristics. A planar tapered slot antenna was proposed according to the results of the analysis methods. Measured and simulated results demonstrate the antenna performance. The antenna shows good impedance matching over a wide bandwidth of 9 GHz, from 2 GHz to 11 GHz, and good radiation patterns. It is suitable for ultra-wideband applications.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "6", "date_publication": "Feb. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "1 - 6"}, "authors": ["Yuan Yao", "Wenhua Chen", "Bin Huang", "Zhenghe Feng", "Zhijun Zhang"], "keywords": ["Antenna measurements", "Antenna radiation patterns", "Impedance", "Slot antennas", "Ultra wideband antennas", "Vivaldi antennas", "Vivaldi", "planar antenna", "tapered slot antenna", "ultra-wideband (UWB)", ""], "arnumber": "6073153"}
