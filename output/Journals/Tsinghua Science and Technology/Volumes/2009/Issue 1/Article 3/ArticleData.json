Deep inspection emerges as a seamless integration of packet classification for access control and pattern matching for intrusion prevention. The two function blocks are linked together via well-designed session lookup schemes. This paper presents an architecture-aware session lookup scheme for deep inspection on network processors (NPs). Test results show that the proposed session data structure and integration approach can achieve the OC-48 line rate (2.5 Gbps) with inline stateful content inspection on the Intel IXP2850 NP. This work provides an insight into application design and implementation on NPs and principles for performance tuning of NP-based programming such as data allocation, task partitioning, latency hiding, and thread synchronization.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "14", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "Feb. 2009", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2009", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "19 - 28"}, "authors": ["Bo Xu", "Fei He", "Yibo Xue", "Jun Li"], "keywords": ["Data structures", "Fires", "Inspection", "Out of order", "Resource management", "Security", "deep inspection", "network processor", "performance optimization", "session lookup", ""], "arnumber": "6073155"}
