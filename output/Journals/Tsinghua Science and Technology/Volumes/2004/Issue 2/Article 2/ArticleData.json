Twenty four column specimens were confined with carbon fiber sheet (CFS) and five column specimens were hybrid confined with both CFS and glass fiber sheet (GFS). The influence of aspect ratio, FS material, initial axial force ratio, and FS confinement degree on the strength and deformation of columns were studied. Based on the experimental results, the equations of complete stress-strain curve of CFS confined concrete are proposed. These equations are suitable for the nonlinear analysis of square and rectangular section columns. Suggestions of applying FS to confine concrete columns are presented.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "130", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "137", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "130 - 137"}, "authors": ["Jing Li", "Jiaru Qian", "Jianbiao Jiang"], "keywords": ["Concrete", "Force", "Hafnium", "Polymers", "Strain", "Stress", "axial compressive force", "confined concrete column", "equation of complete stress-strain curve", "fiber-reinforced polymer sheet (FS)", "strength and deformation", ""], "arnumber": "6075646"}
