A 2-D cellular automata (CA) model of the computer network was presented to analyze the algorithm. The results show that the procedure of establishing a stable route is self-organized towards the attractive peculiar state, and the duration of time for the routing establishment is power-law distributed. A practical ant routing protocol over an IP network was also presented, and two simulations were done to compare the performance dynamic and the load balancing performance between this protocol and the open shortest path first (OSPF) protocol. The results show that the ant routing protocol out-performs OSPF in these aspects.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "213", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "218", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "213 - 218"}, "authors": ["Lin Zhang", "Yang Ren", "Xiuming Shan"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Heuristic algorithms", "IP networks", "Load management", "Routing", "Routing protocols", "power-law distribution", "routing", "self-organization", ""], "arnumber": "6075659"}
