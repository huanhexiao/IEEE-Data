In the present study, we extend the boundary-value problem of impermeable varying topography to that of a variable depth porous seabed, which is the situation most likely to be encountered in practical problems of coastal engineering. A wave-induced fluid motion is applied to the porous bottom, while the well-known linear potential theory is applied to the free-water above the bottom. Eigenfunction expansions are employed to derive the matching condition and the so-called modified dispersion relation. As a result of the porous bottom, the wavenumber becomes a complex value, of which the real part represents the spatial periodicity while the imaginary part refers to the energy dissipation. The characteristics of water waves over a porous bottom are studied in detail. By neglecting the non-propagating modes which only have a local effect and damp exponentially with distance, we derive a mathematical model to represent the characteristics of both the wave refraction-diffraction and wave-damping. The developed model is applied to the damping problem of waves over submerged porous breakwaters.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "138", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "147", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "138 - 147"}, "authors": ["Shutang Zhu"], "keywords": ["Damping", "Dispersion", "Equations", "Fluids", "Friction", "Mathematical model", "Surfaces", "porous breakwater", "potential theory", "wave refraction-diffraction", "wave-damping", ""], "arnumber": "6075647"}
