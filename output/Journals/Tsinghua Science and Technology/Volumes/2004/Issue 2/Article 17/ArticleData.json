Neither drilling nor suspending the substrate is required, and the integrity of the ground plane is maintained. This paper presents several modification techniques for sandwich PBG structure fabrication. The forbidden gap can be improved by adopting the chirping technique, applying the tapering technique, enlarging the periodic elements, adjusting the location of the periodic lattice in the substrate, and using different dielectric media H-shape elements. A finite difference time domain method is applied to analyze the structures. Deep and wide stopbands can be obtained using the modified sandwich structures. Experimental measurement results agree well with the theoretical analysis.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "227", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "233", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "227 - 233"}, "authors": ["Yunbo Pang", "Baoxin Gao"], "keywords": ["Chirp", "Impedance", "Lattices", "Microstrip", "Periodic structures", "Sandwich structures", "Substrates", "finite difference time domain method", "microstrip", "photonic bandgap", ""], "arnumber": "6075661"}
