The adaptation of Runge-Kutta methods with a Lagrange interpolation procedure was focused on inheriting the asymptotic stability of underlying linear systems. The results show that an A-stable RungeKutta method preserves the asympototic stability of underlying linear systems whenever an unconstrained grid is used.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "185", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "188", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "185 - 188"}, "authors": ["Siqing Gan", "Weimin Zheng"], "keywords": ["Asymptotic stability", "Delay", "Differential equations", "Equations", "Linear systems", "Numerical stability", "Stability analysis", "Runge-Kutta methods", "delay integro-differential equations", "interpolation", "numerical stability", ""], "arnumber": "6075654"}
