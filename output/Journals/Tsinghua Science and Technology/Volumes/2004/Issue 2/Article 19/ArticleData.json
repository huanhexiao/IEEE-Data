One way to improve the efficiency, and therefore lower the cost, is to increase the minority carrier lifetime by controlling the material defects. The main defects in grain boundaries of polycrystalline silicon gettered by porous silicon and heavy phosphorous diffusion have been studied. The porous silicon was formed on the two surfaces of wafers by chemical etching. Phosphorous was then diffused into the wafers at high temperature (9000\u00b0C). After the porous silicon and diffusion layers were removed, the minority carrier lifetime was measured by photo-conductor decay. The results show that the lifetime's minority carriers are increased greatly after such treatment.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "242", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "245", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "242 - 245"}, "authors": ["Zuming Liu", "Souleymane K Traore", "Zhongwen Zhang", "Yi Luo"], "keywords": ["Charge carrier lifetime", "Chemicals", "Etching", "Gettering", "Grain boundaries", "Photovoltaic cells", "Silicon", "grain boundaries passivation", "heavy phosphorous diffusion", "polycrystalline gettering", "porous silicon", ""], "arnumber": "6075663"}
