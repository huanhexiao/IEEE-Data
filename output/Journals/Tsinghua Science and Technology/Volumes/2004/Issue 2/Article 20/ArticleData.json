This paper describes the system, which consists of a 32-channel high resolution of 0.02% OTR detector, especially the spectrometer. The OTR angular-distribution pattern at the focal plane has two apexes, but the two apexes are smoothed out due to the electron beam energy distribution. The energy spectrum can be measured if the magnet energy resolution is higher than 0.7% to distinguish the electron beam energy distribution.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "246", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "248", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "246 - 248"}, "authors": ["Quanfeng Li", "Pin Wu", "Jianjiang Gao", "Gang Wu"], "keywords": ["Electron beams", "Electron optics", "Laser beams", "Measurement by laser beam", "Optical variables measurement", "beam diagnostics", "energy spectrum", "optical transition radiation", ""], "arnumber": "6075664"}
