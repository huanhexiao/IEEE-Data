The method assumes the deflected shape of the column as a half cosine wave. Analytical results were compared with experimental values obtained from 16 reinforced-concrete pipe columns. Using deflection at column mid-height recorded during the loading process, a typical load-deflection curve can be plotted and used to describe column behavior. The experimental results demonstrate that the failure of concrete columns is a process. The starting point is the cracking load point, when cracks are initiated in the concrete of the tensile zone of the critical cross-section of specimens. The maximum load point is the top of the failure process, and then the maximum bending moment occurs. The first point represents instability while the second one corresponds to the strength failure of the columns. The experimental results are close to the analytical values. The method is simple and can be used for stability analysis of reinforced-concrete pipe columns.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "153", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "159", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "153 - 159"}, "authors": ["Paul Nibasumba", "Xila Liu"], "keywords": ["Concrete", "Elasticity", "Loading", "Stability analysis", "Steel", "Strain", "maximum load", "pipe column", "reinforced-concrete", ""], "arnumber": "6075649"}
