This paper focuses on two representative techniques needed for high-performance network processors: hardwired logic design and multithread design. Using hardwired logic, this paper compares a single-thread design with a multithread design, and proposes general models and principles to analyze the clock frequency and the resource cost for these environments. Then, two IP header processing schemes, one in single-thread mode and the other in double-thread mode, are developed using these principles and the implementation results verified the theoretical calculation.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "207", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "212", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "207 - 212"}, "authors": ["Xudong Li", "Yang Xu", "Bin Liu", "Xiaojun Wang"], "keywords": ["Clocks", "IP networks", "Instruction sets", "Load management", "Pipeline processing", "Process control", "IP header processing", "hardwired logic", "multithread", "network processor (NP)", ""], "arnumber": "6075658"}
