Collaborative learning, as an important principle in constructivist learning theory, is an important instruction mode for open and distance learning systems. Through collaborative learning, students can greatly improve their creativity, exploration capability, and social cooperation. This paper used an agent-based coordination mechanism to respond to the requirements of an efficient and motivating learning process. This coordination mechanism is based on a Web-based constructivist collaborative learning system, in which students can learn in groups and interact with each other by several kinds of communication modes to achieve their learning objectives efficiently and actively. In this learning system, artificial agents represent an active part in the collaborative learning process; they can partially replace human instructors during the multi-mode interaction of the students.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "189", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "196", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "189 - 196"}, "authors": ["Ying Liu", "Fuzong Lin", "Xue Wang"], "keywords": ["Collaboration", "Collaborative work", "Computational modeling", "Education", "History", "Learning systems", "Materials", "agent-based application", "collaborative learning", "intelligent agents", "web-based education", ""], "arnumber": "6075655"}
