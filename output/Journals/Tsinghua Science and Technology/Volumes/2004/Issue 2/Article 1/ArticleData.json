The effects of nonlinear terms on the frequency of Timoshenko beams with simply supported ends (supported-supported, SS), clamped ends (clamped-clamped, CC) and one end simply supported and the other end clamped (clamped-supported, CS) are discussed in detail. Given a specific vibration amplitude, the change of nonlinear frequency according to the effects of boundary conditions is always in the following descending order: SS, CS, and CC. It is found that the slenderness ratio has a significant influence on the nonlinear frequency. For slender beams, the nonlinear effects of bending curvature and shear strain are negligible regardless of the boundary conditions. For short beams and especially for those of large amplitude vibrations, however, the nonlinear effects of bending curvature and shear strain become noticeable in the following ascending order: SS, CS, and CC.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "125", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "129", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "125 - 129"}, "authors": ["Qiang Guo", "Xi Liu", "Hongzhi Zhong"], "keywords": ["Boundary conditions", "Differential equations", "Educational institutions", "Finite element methods", "Nonlinear dynamical systems", "Strain", "Vibrations", "Timoshenko beam", "differential quadrature method", "nonlinear vibration", ""], "arnumber": "6075645"}
