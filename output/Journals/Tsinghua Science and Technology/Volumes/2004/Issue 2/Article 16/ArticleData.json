Subassembly planning and assembly priority reasoning techniques were utilized to find heuristic information to improve the efficiency of assembly process planning. Tool planning was implemented to consider tool requirements in the product design stage. New methods were developed to reduce the computation amount involved in interference checking. As an important feature of the VASS, human interaction was integrated into the whole process of assembly process planning, extending the power of computer reasoning by including human expertise, resulting in better assembly plans and better designs.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "219", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "226", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "219 - 226"}, "authors": ["Huafei Liao", "Linxuan Zhang", "Tianyuan Xiao", "Li Zeng", "Yue Gu"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Assembly", "Computational modeling", "Fasteners", "Planning", "Process planning", "Solid modeling", "assembly process chart", "assembly process planning", "assembly simulation", "tool planning", ""], "arnumber": "6075660"}
