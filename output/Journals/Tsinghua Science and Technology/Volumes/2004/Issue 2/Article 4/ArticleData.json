Under 2-point loading and changing shear span ratio, changes in loading capacity for beams of the same corrosion degree were studied. Formulas relating ultimate moment of reinforcements with the same corrosion level at increasing a/d ratio were then developed. Load-carrying capacity profile for beams with reinforcement corrosion of 1% and the same cross section was described. The minimum ultimate moment occurs at a/d = 2.5 and at 52% of the full flexural moment, suggesting that the difference in ultimate moment between theoretical and experimental results at the minimum point equals 11%. The results show that the developed theoretical relations compared well with experimental values.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "148", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "152", "date_publication": "April 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "148 - 152"}, "authors": ["Victor S.
