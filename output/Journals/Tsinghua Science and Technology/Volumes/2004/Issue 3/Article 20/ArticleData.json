Each part of the BIW was identified and digitalized to conduct a finite element model. A frontal crash was simulated numerically using the explicit finite element analysis software LS-DYNA. BIW crash tests were conducted to validate the finite element model. The computational results agree well with the test data, not only for the collapse mode, but also in the force-time and acceleration-time correlation curves. The methods used to create the finite element model can be used to further improve or develop safer vehicles.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "338", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "344", "date_publication": "June 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "338 - 344"}, "authors": ["Qingchun Wang", "Zijie Fan", "Liangjin Gui", "Zongyu Chen", "Hongwei Song"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Computational modeling", "Computer crashes", "Finite element methods", "Numerical models", "Vehicle crash testing", "Vehicles", "body in white (BIW)", "crashworthiness", "energy absorption", ""], "arnumber": "6075687"}
