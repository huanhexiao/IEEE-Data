The relationship between the frictional heat and the thermal stress was investigated for concave cylinder contact conditions. The results show that, as a nonlinear contact problem, the frictional heat at the contact areas changes with moving velocity in both value and distribution, and that the transient frictional heat at the dynamic condition has a peak within a cycle. The dynamic process of friction heat and thermal stresses affects diffusion of the frictional effects. The result can be helpful for dynamic simulation of diffusion lubrication of elements at elevated temperatures.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "303", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "307", "date_publication": "June 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "303 - 307"}, "authors": ["Yibing Zhang", "Zuomin Liu"], "keywords": ["Force", "Friction", "Heating", "Insulators", "Stress", "Thermal analysis", "Thermal stresses", "dynamic simulation", "frictional heat", "sliding bearing", "thermal stress analysis", ""], "arnumber": "6075680"}
