In the simulation method, times-to-failure of an unreliable large production line is assumed to follow exponential distribution, whereas times-to-repair and times-to-processing are set to follow an Erlang-k distribution. Using a genetic algorithm based on special position-based mapping means and elitist protection strategy, the buffer configuration of an auto-body welding line is optimized. The simulation of the optimized configuration shows that the performance of the production line, such as productivity and the main average utilization of the workstations, is much improved. This model can optimize the allocation of buffers for unreliable large production lines effectively.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "363", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "368", "date_publication": "June 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "363 - 368"}, "authors": ["Ting Wu", "Bo Sui", "Dong Du", "Zandong Han", "Feng Zhai"], "keywords": ["Biological cells", "Computational modeling", "Discrete event systems", "Genetic algorithms", "Resource management", "Welding", "buffer allocation", "discrete event system simulation", "genetic algorithm", "unreliable large production line", ""], "arnumber": "6075691"}
