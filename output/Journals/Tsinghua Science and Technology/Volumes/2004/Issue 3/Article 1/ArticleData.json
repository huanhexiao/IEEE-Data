Different from signal analysis based methods, a dynamic model based diagnosis technique can further diagnose the location and severity of the fault, and detect multiple faults at one time. A model based fault diagnosis method was developed to identify typical faults of rotating machinery. This method can identify mass unbalances, crack locations and sizes, and oil film parameters in rotating machinery by optimization methods and dynamics simulation technique. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate that the method is useful for detecting faults of rotating systems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "249", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "253", "date_publication": "June 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "249 - 253"}, "authors": ["Dan Guo", "Wenxiu Lu", "Zhenyong Chen", "Fulei Chu"], "keywords": ["Fault diagnosis", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Rotors", "Shafts", "Vectors", "Vibrations", "fault identification", "optimized method", "rotor system", "vibration response", ""], "arnumber": "6075668"}
