This system uses two charge coupled device (CCD) cameras mounted on the end-effector of the robot. System analysis is based on the stereovision theory and line-matching technology, using a computer to evaluate the dynamic performance parameters of an articulate robot from the two images captured by the two cameras. The measuring procedure includes four stages, namely, calibration, sampling, image processing, and calculation. The path accuracy of an articulate industrial robot was measured by this system. The results show that this system is a low-cost, easy to operate, and simple system for the dynamic performance testing of articulate robots.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "356", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "362", "date_publication": "June 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "356 - 362"}, "authors": ["Bo Sui", "Dong Du", "Qiang Chen", "Xiangyu Han", "Li Wang", "Hua Zhang"], "keywords": ["Cameras", "Equations", "Mathematical model", "Robot kinematics", "Robot vision systems", "Service robots", "articulate robot", "hand-eye", "path accuracy", "vision measuring system", ""], "arnumber": "6075690"}
