This paper presents a framework for grid manufacturing, which neatly combines grid technology with the infrastructure of advanced manufacturing technology. The paper studies gridoriented knowledge description and acquisition, and constructs a distributed knowledge grid model. The paper also deals with the protocol of node description in collaborative design, and describes a distributed collaborative design model. The protocol and node technology leads to a collaborative production model for grid manufacturing. The framework for grid manufacturing offers an effective and feasible solution for the problems of networked manufacturing. The grid manufacturing will become an advanced distributed manufacturing model and promote the development of advanced manufacturing technologies.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "327", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "330", "date_publication": "June 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "327 - 330"}, "authors": ["Li Chen", "Hong Deng", "Qianni Deng", "Zhenyu Wu"], "keywords": ["Collaboration", "Computational modeling", "Educational institutions", "Job shop scheduling", "Manufacturing", "Protocols", "Solid modeling", "collaborative design", "data grid", "grid manufacturing", "knowledge grid", "manufacturing resources allocation", ""], "arnumber": "6075685"}
