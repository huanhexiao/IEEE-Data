To incorporate more accurately the damping mechanism of belt material, linear viscoelastic models are adopted in a unified form of differential operators. To circumvent high-order differential vibration equation of time-varying coefficients and with gyroscopic and nonlinear terms, where analytical solution is almost impossible, a systematic approach is presented by reforming the motion equation and directly using the method of multiple scales. To exemplify the procedure, the solutions at principal resonance are obtained and their stability conditions are derived for employing a Kelvin-Voigt model to reflect the property of the belt material. The solutions and stability conditions successfully reduce to those for using Kelvin model and elastic model, which validate the present approaches. Numerical simulations highlight the effects of tension fluctuations and translating speeds on the stability of the belt vibration.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "331", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "337", "date_publication": "June 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "331 - 337"}, "authors": ["Zhichao Hou", "J W Zu"], "keywords": ["Belts", "Equations", "Kelvin", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Numerical stability", "Stability analysis", "analytical solution", "belt drive", "moving string", "parametric excitation", "stability", "viscoelastic model", ""], "arnumber": "6075686"}
