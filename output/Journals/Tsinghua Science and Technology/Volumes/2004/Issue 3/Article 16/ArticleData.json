It is necessary to investigate the dry sliding friction and wear behavior of surface. In this paper, 3-D topographical parameters were used to investigate the topographical characteristics of dry sliding surfaces for particle-reinforced aluminum composites on semi-metallic friction material. The experimental results indicate that the surface topography of the particle-reinforced aluminum composites can be divided into two types, the flakingoff pit type and the groove type. The composites whose surface topography is the flaking-off pit type possess superior heat conductivity and bearing area, lower wear rate, and higher friction coefficient than the groove type. Consequently, the flaking-off pit type surface topography is much better than the groove type for particle-reinforced aluminum composites on semi-metallic friction materials in dry sliding.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "317", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "321", "date_publication": "June 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "317 - 321"}, "authors": ["Yue Chen", "Bao Shangguan", "Yongzhen Zhang", "Lemin Sun", "Xishun Tie", "Yuehong Xia"], "keywords": ["Friction", "Materials", "Rough surfaces", "Surface morphology", "Surface roughness", "Surface topography", "3-D surface topography", "dry sliding condition", "particle-reinforced aluminum composites", ""], "arnumber": "6075683"}
