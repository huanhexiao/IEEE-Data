The seal faces are deformed with different loads. The deformation of the seal faces affects the performance of mechanical face seals, which leads to water leakage, so the seal face deformation must be analyzed. A mechanics model with deformation equations was developed to describe ship stern-shaft seals. An example was given to verify the deformation equations. The solution of the deformation equations gives a theoretical basis for the analysis of seal leakage and improvements of seal structures.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "299", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "302", "date_publication": "June 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "299 - 302"}, "authors": ["Hanhua Zhu", "Zhenglin Liu", "Shizhu Wen", "Xinping Yan"], "keywords": ["Equations", "Face", "Load modeling", "Marine vehicles", "Mathematical model", "Seals", "Shafts", "load", "mechanical seal", "pressure", "seal face deformation", "shaft", ""], "arnumber": "6075679"}
