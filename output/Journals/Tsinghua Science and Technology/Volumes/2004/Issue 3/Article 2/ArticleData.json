The fundamental principles of the wear-graphy system and its wear-gram system are discussed here. A method was developed to distribute wear debris on a slide uniformly to reduce overlapping of wear debris while smearing. The composition identification analyzes the wear debris using the scanning electron microscope (SEM) energy spectrum, infrared-thermal imaging and X-ray imaging technology. A wear debris analysis system based on database techniques is demonstrated, and a visible digitized wear-gram is acquired based on the information of wear debris with image collection and processing of the wear debris. The method gives the morphological characteristics of the wear debris, material composition identification of the wear debris, intelligent recognition of the wear debris, and storage and management of wear debris information.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "254", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "257", "date_publication": "June 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "254 - 257"}, "authors": ["Ming Chen", "Weihua Wang", "Yonghui Yin", "Chengtao Wang"], "keywords": ["Feature extraction", "Fluids", "Head", "Image color analysis", "Shape", "X-ray imaging", "material identification", "wear debris monitoring", "wear debris recognition", "wear-gram numeralization", "wear-graphy", ""], "arnumber": "6075669"}
