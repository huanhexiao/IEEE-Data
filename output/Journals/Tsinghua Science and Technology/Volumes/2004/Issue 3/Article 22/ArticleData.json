After analyzing the status and disposal of the municipal refuse in China, this paper proposes a technique of refuse incineration, using a fluid-bed incinerator, which converts refuse into energy. The technique of controlling secondary pollution in combustion is also discussed. In this paper, the technique of incineration using a fluid-bed incinerator is introduced. During the combustion process, the refuse is mixed with coal and remover and a noxious gas removal system is installed, which helps to decrease the generation and emission of noxious material, such as dioxins. The result shows that the secondary pollution in refuse incineration is efficiently controlled.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "351", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "355", "date_publication": "June 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "351 - 355"}, "authors": ["Fayong Wu", "Liping Duan", "Hong Chen", "Maoqing Xie"], "keywords": ["Combustion", "Educational institutions", "Furnaces", "Incineration", "Pollution", "Thermal engineering", "Waste materials", "energy recycling", "municipal refuse", "pollution control", ""], "arnumber": "6075689"}
