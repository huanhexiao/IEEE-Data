The experimental tests were carried out on a modified piston ringcylinder liner bench tester with different particle mass fractions of 0, 0.02%, and 0.10%. The results show that compared with a pure fluid, the mixture of the fluid and UDD not only reduces the friction and wear, but also reduces the bulk temperature of the specimen. The mechanism by which the UDD lubricant improves the tribological properties has some relationship with surface topography, because it can increase the bearing capability of surfaces.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "286", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "289", "date_publication": "June 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "286 - 289"}, "authors": ["Xiaojun Liu", "Kun Liu", "Minghua Jiao", "Wei Wang", "Shuguang Ding"], "keywords": ["Fluids", "Friction", "Lubrication", "Pistons", "Solids", "Surface topography", "Temperature", "cylinder liner", "piston ring", "surface topography", "ultra-dispersed diamond", "wear", ""], "arnumber": "6075676"}
