A finite element analysis and optimum design were carried out. The three-dimensional stress diagram shows that the stress concentration is rather severe in the bridge of the hot extrusion die, and that the stress distribution is very uneven. The optimum dimensions are obtained. The results show that the optimum height of the extrusion die is 89.596 mm. The optimum radii of diffluence holes are 65.048 mm and 80.065 mm. The stress concentration is reduced by 27%.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "290", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "293", "date_publication": "June 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "290 - 293"}, "authors": ["Cijun Shuai", "Gang Xiao", "Zhengshun Ni"], "keywords": ["Aluminum", "Bridges", "Finite element methods", "Presses", "Shape", "Solid modeling", "Stress", "hot extrusion die", "modeling", "optimum design", "three-dimensional method", ""], "arnumber": "6075677"}
