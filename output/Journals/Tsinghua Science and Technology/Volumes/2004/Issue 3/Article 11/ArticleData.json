The lateral vibration of the microresonator was modeled assuming that the symmetry of the microstructures and the applied loads are different. Methods were given to calculate the stress, lateral displacement, spring coefficient, and resonant frequency. The results show that the simple mechanical model is a superfluous system with three unknown variables. The results differ from pervious results for a microresonator suspended from double-side straight-leg beams, which has been commonly used to design linear microvibromotors.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "294", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "298", "date_publication": "June 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "294 - 298"}, "authors": ["Xuejin Shen", "Xiaoyang Chen"], "keywords": ["Force", "Microcavities", "Resonant frequency", "Sensors", "Springs", "Suspensions", "laterally driven microresonator", "mechanical properties", "one-side flexural suspension", ""], "arnumber": "6075678"}
