Nowadays, most measuring methods are based on offline sampling or on online measuring with a single sensor. An online oil monitoring system with multiple sensors was designed. The measurement data was processed with a fuzzy intelligence system. Information from integrated sensors in an oil online monitoring system was evaluated using fuzzy logic. The analyses show that the multiple sensors evaluation results are more reliable than online monitoring systems with single sensors.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "258", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "261", "date_publication": "June 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "258 - 261"}, "authors": ["Huiliang Gao", "Xincong Zhou", "Haiming Cheng", "Chunhua Zhao", "Xinping Yan"], "keywords": ["Fuzzy logic", "Monitoring", "Sensor phenomena and characterization", "Sensor systems", "Temperature measurement", "Viscosity", "fuzzy", "oil monitoring", "online monitor", "sensor", ""], "arnumber": "6075670"}
