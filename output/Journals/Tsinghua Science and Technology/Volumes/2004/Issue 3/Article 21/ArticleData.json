Based on the current protocol (ISO-11898 and SAE J1939), a new practical protocol is proposed and implemented for the control and communication network in fuel cell vehicles. To improve the reliability of data communication and to unify the network management, a new network system based on dual-port RAM is also implemented.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "345", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "350", "date_publication": "June 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "345 - 350"}, "authors": ["Yuan Zhu", "Hao Wu", "Guangyu Tian", "Xianhui Yang", "Zhao Li'an", "Weibo Zhou"], "keywords": ["Communication networks", "Computer architecture", "Fuel cell vehicles", "Fuel cells", "Protocols", "Random access memory", "SAE J1939", "controller area network (CAN)", "dual-port RAM", "fuel cell vehicle", ""], "arnumber": "6075688"}
