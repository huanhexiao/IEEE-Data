The result shows that the wear debris concentration in the circulating drilling mud in a well reflects the total wear rate of the triboelements in the well, while the wear detection of a tooljoint can indicate its wear loss between two contiguous times of drill-pipe lifting. A diagnosis method that integrates the two types of information was developed to identify severe wear regions in well casing. Theoretical analyses and field test show that the severe casing wear region can be located relatively accurately by the integrated method. This method presents a new ground casing wear diagnosis approach with good real-time results.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "266", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "269", "date_publication": "June 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "266 - 269"}, "authors": ["Jianchun Fan", "Laibin Zhang", "Dong Wen", "Lei Yu"], "keywords": ["Cameras", "Charge coupled devices", "Drilling machines", "Friction", "Monitoring", "Petroleum", "Real time systems", "casing wear", "fault diagnosis", "well drilling", ""], "arnumber": "6075672"}
