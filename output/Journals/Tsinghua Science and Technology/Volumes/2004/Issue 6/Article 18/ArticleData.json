The curved shape is obtained by raising the control points above the projection plane. The convergence was improved using pseudo material properties to get a preliminary shape, and then using the real properties to get the final shape. A large number of examples were analyzed to verify the validity and practicality of this method. The results show that the final curved surface after the second shape finding process is always quite similar to the first one. Moreover, the curved surface obtained after the second shape finding process is accurate and will be realized in real materials.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "726", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "730", "date_publication": "Dec. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "726 - 730"}, "authors": ["Yang Weiguo", "Zhen Wei", "Xu Fujiang", "Na Xiangqian"], "keywords": ["Equations", "Finite element methods", "Mathematical model", "Power cables", "Shape", "Stress", "Surface treatment", "membrane structure", "nonlinear", "pseudo material properties", "second shape finding", "shape finding", ""], "arnumber": "6075982"}
