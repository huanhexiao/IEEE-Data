The probe of the flexible eddy current sensor array, which includes a set of sensor coils, is fabricated on a thin flexible substrate using the flexible printed circuit board process which allows the probe to be very thin and flexible so that it can conform to the surface geometry of the measured objects. The sensor coils are connected to an inductance-capacitance oscillator, which converts the distance between the sensor coil and the metallic target to a frequency output. Experimental results show that the measurement accuracy of the sensor system can reach \u00b10.5% for a 2-mm gap and the sensor system is suitable for online gap measurements.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "667", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "671", "date_publication": "Dec. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "667 - 671"}, "authors": ["Tianhuai Ding", "Xianglin Chen", "Yiping Huang"], "keywords": ["Arrays", "Coils", "Current measurement", "Eddy currents", "Frequency measurement", "Probes", "Sensor systems", "eddy current testing", "flexible sensor array", "gap measurement", "time division multiplexing", ""], "arnumber": "6075971"}
