While researchers have studied motor commands needed to drive a limb to follow a path trajectory, various computer algorithms have been reported that provide adequate analysis of limb modeling and motion. This paper uses a rigorous mathematical formulation to model human limbs, understand their reach envelope, delineate barriers therein where a trajectory becomes difficult to control, and help visualize these barriers. Workspaces of a typical forearm with 9 degrees of freedom, a typical finger modeled as a 4-degree-of-freedom system, and a lower extremity with 4 degrees of freedom are discussed. The results show that using the proposed formulation, joint limits play an important role in distinguishing the barriers.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "653", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "666", "date_publication": "Dec. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "653 - 666"}, "authors": ["Jingzhou Yang", "Yunqing Zhang", "Liping Chen", "Karim Abdel-Malek"], "keywords": ["Computational modeling", "Humans", "Jacobian matrices", "Joints", "Kinematics", "Mathematical model", "Trajectory", "barriers", "biomechanics", "degree of freedom", "human extremities", ""], "arnumber": "6075970"}
