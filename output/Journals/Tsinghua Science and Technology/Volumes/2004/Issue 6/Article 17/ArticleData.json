A triangular serendipity transformation was introduced to map the sectorial domain onto a unit isosceles right triangle. The first six non-dimensional frequencies of the sectorial plates were obtained for various combinations of clamped and simply supported boundary conditions. For sectorial plates with simply supported radial edges, the present results agree well with the available exact solutions and finite element solutions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "717", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "725", "date_publication": "Dec. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "717 - 725"}, "authors": ["Li Xin", "Zhong Hongzhi", "He Yuhong"], "keywords": ["Approximation methods", "Boundary conditions", "Convergence", "Equations", "Finite element methods", "Jacobian matrices", "Vibrations", "Mindlin plate", "free vibration", "sectorial plate", "triangular differential quadrature", ""], "arnumber": "6075981"}
