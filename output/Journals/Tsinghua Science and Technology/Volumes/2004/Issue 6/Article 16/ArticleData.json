This paper analyzes the characteristics and probabilistic models of resistance, loads, and load effects. A method was developed to calculate the probability of failure based on Monte Carlo simulation and models proposed in previous articles. Construction examples were used to analyze the influence of live load on the probability of failure. The results show that when the live load increases, the maximum probability of failure increases with acceleration. The results suggest that the construction live load should be carefully addressed during construction.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "710", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "716", "date_publication": "Dec. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "710 - 716"}, "authors": ["Fang Dongping", "Geng Chuandong", "Zhang Chuanmin", "Zhu Hongyi", "Liu Xila"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Concrete", "Load modeling", "Resistance", "Safety", "Uncertainty", "during construction", "failure probability", "load redistribution", "reinforced concrete buildings", ""], "arnumber": "6075980"}
