A 3-D nonlinear finite element model, based on the actual geometry of the residual limb, including internal bones and socket liner, was developed to study the mechanical interaction between the socket and the residual limb during walking. To simulate the friction/slip boundary conditions between the skin and liner, automated surface-to-surface contact was used. The results show that interface pressure and shear stress have a similar double-peaked waveform shape in the stance phase. The average difference in interface stresses between the cases with and without consideration of inertial forces is 8.4% in the stance phase and 20.1% in the swing phase. The results suggest that the dynamic effects of inertial loads on interface stress distribution during walking must be considered in prosthetic socket design.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "680", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "683", "date_publication": "Dec. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "680 - 683"}, "authors": ["Jia Xiaohong", "Zhang Ming", "Wang Rencheng", "Jin Dewen"], "keywords": ["Dynamics", "Finite element methods", "Legged locomotion", "Load modeling", "Prosthetics", "Sockets", "Stress", "dynamic effect", "finite element analysis", "inertial load", "interface stress", "prosthetic socket", ""], "arnumber": "6075974"}
