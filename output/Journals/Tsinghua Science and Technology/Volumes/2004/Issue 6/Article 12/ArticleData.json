The coupled equations were solved to determine the pumping characteristics. The numerical results agree with experimental data from micropumps with different diameter microtubes. The maximum flow rate reached 33 \u03bcL / min and the maximum pump pressure was over 20 kPa for a 200-\u03bcm diameter microtube. Analysis of the pumping mechanism shows that the main factors affecting the flow come from the large density difference between the liquid and vapor phases and the choking effect of the vapor region.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "688", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "693", "date_publication": "Dec. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "688 - 693"}, "authors": ["Wang Moran", "Li Zhixi"], "keywords": ["Cooling", "Electron tubes", "Fluids", "Heating", "Mathematical model", "Micropumps", "micropump", "phase change", "pumping mechanism", "valveless", ""], "arnumber": "6075976"}
