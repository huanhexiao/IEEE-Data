The effects of initial grain size, deformation temperature, strain, and strain rate on the austenitic recrystallized volume fraction and grain size were studied using a Gleeble machine. The results show that deformation reduces the grain size when the recrystallized volume fraction is large. The static recrystallized volume fraction increases with increasing deformation temperature, strain, and strain rate, and decreasing initial grain size. The grain size during metadynamic recrystallization is independent of the deformation strain and the initial grain size. The recrystallized volume fraction, the grain size, and the grown grain size calculated by the correlations are consistent with the measured values.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "622", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "627", "date_publication": "Dec. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "622 - 627"}, "authors": ["Bingzhen Shen", "Nengwei Fang", "Houfa Shen", "Baicheng Liu"], "keywords": ["Grain size", "Microstructure", "Size measurement", "Steel", "Strain", "Temperature measurement", "Volume measurement", "low carbon steel", "metadynamic recrystallization", "microstructure", "static recrystallization", ""], "arnumber": "6075966"}
