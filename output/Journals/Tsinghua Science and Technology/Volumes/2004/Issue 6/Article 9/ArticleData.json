The 45-\u03bcm and 350-\u03bcm diameter glass beads were used as the particles in the experiments. An acoustic speaker was used to introduce velocity perturbations at the jet exit. The Strouhal number based on the nozzle diameter, exit velocity, and forcing frequency was varied from 0.1 to 0.9. The Reynolds number was 9400. The coherent structures were visualized in unforced and forced single-phase jet flows and unforced and forced particle-laden jet flows with different diameter glass beads. The experimental results show that the particles have significant effects on the gas phase coherent structures. The coherent structures are controlled by the large 350-\u03bcm diameter particles, while the structures are mainly dominated by the forced disturbances in the flows with 45-\u03bcm diameter particles.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "676", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "679", "date_publication": "Dec. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "676 - 679"}, "authors": ["Yi Rong", "Huiqiang Zhang", "Xilin Wang", "C K Chan"], "keywords": ["Combustion", "Fluids", "Generators", "Glass", "Periodic structures", "Strontium", "Visualization", "coherent structures", "flow visualization", "forced disturbances", "gas-particle flows", "round jet", ""], "arnumber": "6075973"}
