The unsteady flow field of a model Francis hydraulic turbine was simulated under part-load operation. A sliding mesh model was used to calculate a time-accurate solution for the strong rotor-stator interactions between the runner and guide vanes, and the draft tube. Based on three-dimensional incompressible Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations and on a renormalization group k-\u220a turbulence model, spatial discretization was obtained by using the finite volume method with unstructured grid elements, and a second order fully implicit scheme was applied for time. Pressure fluctuations in the draft tube were recorded and analyzed via a fast Fourier transform calculation. The results were compared with the experimental data, and show that the vortex rope in the draft tube and the induced pressure fluctuations are well simulated.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "694", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "699", "date_publication": "Dec. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "694 - 699"}, "authors": ["Shao Qi", "Liu Shuhon", "Wu Yulin", "Wu Weizhang", "Tao Xingming"], "keywords": ["Blades", "Computational modeling", "Electron tubes", "Hydraulic turbines", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Solid modeling", "Francis hydraulic turbine", "computer simulation", "rotor-stator interaction", "unsteady flow", "vortex rope", ""], "arnumber": "6075977"}
