The model is based on two extremes, sand cement paste in uniaxial tension and a sand-cement-paste/rock interface in uniaxial tension. Uniaxial tension tests with normal strength concrete measuring the tensile strength of normal strength concrete specimens with different geometrical shapes and different ratios of the aggregate size to the characteristic dimension of the concrete specimen show a significant size effect. The theoretical size effect law prediction agrees well with the experimental data.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "700", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "703", "date_publication": "Dec. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "700 - 703"}, "authors": ["Li Qingbin", "Yin Yuxian"], "keywords": ["Aggregates", "Concrete", "Laboratories", "Loading", "Rocks", "Stress", "aggregate size", "concrete", "extreme case", "size effect law", "uniaxial tension", ""], "arnumber": "6075978"}
