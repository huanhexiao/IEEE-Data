CAD software was used to construct the complicated nozzle in the calculational region. The simulation accuracy was validated by comparison with the classic driven cavity flow problem. The simulation results agree well with water modeling experiments. The simulations show that the velocity distribution at the nozzle port is uneven and the jet faces downward more than the nozzle outlet. Simulations with a configured nozzle and the inlet velocity at the nozzle entrance give precise results and overcome the traditional difficulty in determining the nozzle outlet velocity.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "617", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "621", "date_publication": "Dec. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "617 - 621"}, "authors": ["Lei Wang", "Houfa Shen", "Baicheng Liu"], "keywords": ["Boundary conditions", "Casting", "Cavity resonators", "Computational modeling", "Fluid flow", "Mathematical model", "Slabs", "continuous casting", "mold", "nozzle", "numerical simulation", "turbulent fluid flow", ""], "arnumber": "6075965"}
