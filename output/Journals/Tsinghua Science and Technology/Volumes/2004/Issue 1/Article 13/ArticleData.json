A key issue is whether stem cells can survive, migrate and differentiate following transplantation into the adult central nervous system. This research shows that enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) plasmid electroporation transfected neural stem cells can functionally differentiate in vitro and that most of the EGFP-positive cells can survive and migrate towards the damaged areas when transplanted into the brain of a Parkinson's disease model rat. The results suggest an effective and maneuverable tracing tool to detect whether transplanted neural stem and progenitor cells function in the adult brain in vivo.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "81", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "87", "date_publication": "Feb. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "81 - 87"}, "authors": ["Chang Zhou", "Zhexing Wen", "Zhiping Wang", "Xing Guo", "Dongmei Shi", "Huancong Zuo", "Zuoping Xie"], "keywords": ["Fluorescence", "In vitro", "Neurons", "Parkinson's disease", "Rats", "Stem cells", "Suspensions", "electroporation transfection", "enhanced green fluorescent protein", "migrate", "neural stem cell", "transplantation", ""], "arnumber": "6075635"}
