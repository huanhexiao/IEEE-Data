The inhibition of tobacco polyphenol oxidase was studied using the progress-of-substrate-reaction method proposed by Tsou, following the substrate reaction during irreversible inhibition of the enzyme activity. Analysis of the inhibition kinetics shows that inhibition occurs by an irreversible and non-complexation reaction. The microscopic rate constants were determined for reaction of the inhibitor both with the free enzyme and with the enzyme-substrate complex. The results show that the presence of the substrate has a significant protective effect of the enzyme against inactivation by L-cysteine.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "94", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "97", "date_publication": "Feb. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "94 - 97"}, "authors": ["Weiqun Liu", "Xueming Rao", "Jicheng Pan", "Haimeng Zhou"], "keywords": ["Inhibitors", "Kinetic theory", "Microscopy", "Oxidation", "Proteins", "Substrates", "irreversible inhibition", "kinetics", "polyphenol oxidase", "tobacco", ""], "arnumber": "6075637"}
