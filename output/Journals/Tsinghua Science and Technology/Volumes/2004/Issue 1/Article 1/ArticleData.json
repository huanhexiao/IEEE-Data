A large number of I/O operations are synchronous readlwrite operations of only small data blocks. However, reducing the latency of synchronous I/O operation is a non-trivial problem. In this paper, we propose two methods to address this problem. The first method, FastSync, uses a cache disk optimized for write operation via use of a disk-head position prediction algorithm. In this way, disk capacity is traded for synchronous I/O performance. The second method, LND, uses free memory capacity in a network environment as a cache disk for the buffering of synchronous I/O operation. Data integrity in FastSync is ensured by using a data log on the cache disk, whereas in LND, integrity is ensured by the storage in distributed memory of multiple copies of each data block. Both methods succeed in dramatically increasing the performance of synchronous I/O operation. The performance of LND is limited by the network speed, whereas performance of FastSync is determined mostly by the data block size.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "Feb. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "1 - 8"}, "authors": ["Chao Jin", "Weimin Zheng", "Dongsheng Wang", "Yun Mao"], "keywords": ["Distributed databases", "Magnetic heads", "Random access memory", "Reliability", "Servers", "Software", "Tracking", "disk cache", "durability", "low latency", "network RAM", "persistence", "synchronous I/O", ""], "arnumber": "6075623"}
