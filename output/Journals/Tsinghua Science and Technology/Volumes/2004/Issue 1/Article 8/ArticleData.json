In this paper, a detailed analysis of the stability behavior and accuracy characteristics of this method is given. It is proven by a spectral decomposition method that TSNM is conditionally stable and belongs to the category of explicit time integration methods. By a similar analysis, the characteristic indicators of time integration methods, the percentage period elongation and the amplitude decay of TSNM, are derived in a closed form. The analysis plays an important role in implementing a procedure for automatic searching and finding convergence radii of TSNM. Finally, a linear single degree of freedom undamped system is analyzed to test the properties of the method.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "51", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "56", "date_publication": "Feb. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "51 - 56"}, "authors": ["Libin Zhao", "Zhenhan Yao", "Shoumei Wang"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Convergence", "Equations", "Numerical stability", "Stability analysis", "Taylor series", "Thermal stability", "Taylor series", "accuracy", "stability", "structural dynamics", "time integration", ""], "arnumber": "6075630"}
