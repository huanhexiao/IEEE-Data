This nutrient absorbent polymer dramatically conserves water and reduces fertilizer usage while significantly increasing plant and crop yield. There are numerous benefits that LSWA is engineered to produce, and moreover, with every new application new benefits are discovered. The versatility of this additive will undoubtedly lead to some new applications. LSWA crystals in the soil absorb hundreds of times their mass in water and then, upon demand, release the stored moisture regardless of the soil condition. Unlike previously used polymers, LSWA has great absorbability even under soil pressure, and maintains its absorbability in the presence of fertilizers and other water soluble additives. It is completely non-toxic, and has a lengthy effective period of seven to ten years. LSWA is extremely cost effective due to its low initial cost, the dramatic reduction in the number of watering cycles, the decrease of fertilizer usage and the increase in crop yield, as well as allowing utilization of previously unusable land. When LSWA crystals are added into the soil, irrigation schedule times can be reduced by more than 50%, and fertilizer usage reduced by up to 33%. In this paper, some basic researches on the basic properties of the soil additive are reported. Some applications are described by reference to a number of case studies. Finally, specific recommendations are given for the application rates and methods for a range of crops and soil conditions.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "108", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "115", "date_publication": "Feb. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "108 - 115"}, "authors": ["Darning Huang", "Wenkui Zhang", "Ziwei Shen", "Baoshu Xi"], "keywords": ["Additives", "Crystals", "Fertilizers", "Irrigation", "Polymers", "Soil", "absorbent copolymer", "ecotechnology", "slow-release water-fertilizer-nutrition agent", ""], "arnumber": "6075639"}
