The MCMA is compared with the conventional constant modulus algorithm (CMA) for symbol-spaced equalization of 4PSK signals. The result shows that the performance of the MCMA is superior to that of the CMA in both convergence rate and intersymbol interference for frequency selective channels in noisy environments. Simulation results using 8PSK signals also demonstrate that a fractionally spaced equalizer can preserve performance over variations in symbol-timing phase, whereas a baud-rate equalizer cannot.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "38", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "44", "date_publication": "Feb. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "38 - 44"}, "authors": ["Shouyu Sun", "Junli Zheng", "Lijiang Wu", "Qi Zhang"], "keywords": ["Blind equalizers", "Convergence", "Maximum likelihood detection", "Nonlinear filters", "Training", "Vectors", "blind channel equalization", "constant modulus algorithm (CMA)", "fractionally spaced equalization (FSE)", "modified constant modulus algorithm (MCMA)", "symbol spaced equalization", ""], "arnumber": "6075628"}
