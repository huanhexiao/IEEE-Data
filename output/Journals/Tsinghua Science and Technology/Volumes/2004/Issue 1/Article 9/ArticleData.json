The continuous phase simulation was analyzed using the large eddy simulation (LES) method while the particle phase was analyzed by the Lagrangian method. The spatial and temporal results were used to analyze the evolution of the large eddy coherent structures and the vortex-particle interactions. The effect of the particle Stokes number on the instantaneous particle concentration distributions was also discussed. The simulations of the single-phase flow reproduced the character of the separation and reattachment flow and the essential features of the coherent structures. Numerous and complex vortex structures appeared at the high Reynolds number. Furthermore, the simulation shows that the Stokes number plays an important role in the particle dispersion and the instantaneous particle distribution. The continuous phase time-averaged results and the particle phase time-averaged results obtained from the LES analysis agree well with previous experimental data.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "57", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "63", "date_publication": "Feb. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "57 - 63"}, "authors": ["Bing Wang", "Huiqiang Zhang", "Xilin Wang", "Yincheng Guo", "Wenyi Lin"], "keywords": ["Computational modeling", "Dispersion", "Equations", "Fluids", "Force", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "backward-facing step", "large eddy simulation", "particle diffusion", ""], "arnumber": "6075631"}
