For the purpose of performing conformance testing of the open shortest path first protocol link-state database (LSDB) synchronization process, the authors propose a formal model called global behavior tree, which describes global interactions among routers. The model is capable of representing distributed and concurrent behavior and allows for easy test derivation. The corresponding test notation and test derivation algorithm are studied. A simple test method is developed and a software tester is implemented. The results show that this model easily facilitates the testing process and allows a good test coverage.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Feb. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "9 - 16"}, "authors": ["Zhongjie Li", "Xia Yin", "Jianping Wu"], "keywords": ["Internet", "Reliability", "Routing", "Routing protocols", "Synchronization", "Testing", "distributed and concurrent systems", "open shortest path first (OSPF)", "routing protocol testing", ""], "arnumber": "6075624"}
