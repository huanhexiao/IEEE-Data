For inconsistent rules due to improper selection of split-points during discretization, and/or to lack of information, we propose two methods to remove their inconsistency based on irregular decision tables. By using these methods, inconsistent rules are eliminated as far as possible, without affecting the remaining consistent rules. Experimental test indicates that use of the new method leads to an improvement in the mean accuracy of the extracted rules.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "45", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "50", "date_publication": "Feb. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "45 - 50"}, "authors": ["Yidong Lan", "Lin Zhang", "Lianchen Liu"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Approximation algorithms", "Classification algorithms", "Data mining", "Error analysis", "Information systems", "Local area networks", "classification", "discretization split-point", "inconsistent rule", "irregular decision table", "rough set", ""], "arnumber": "6075629"}
