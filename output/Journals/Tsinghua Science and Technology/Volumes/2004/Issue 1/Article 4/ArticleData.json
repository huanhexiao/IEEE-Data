To overcome performance decline for noisy and nonlinear channels, many kinds of neural network models have been used in nonlinear equalization. In this paper, we propose a new nonlinear channel equalization, which is structured by wavelet neural networks. The orthogonal least square algorithm is applied to update the weighting matrix of wavelet networks to form a more compact wavelet basis unit, thus obtaining good equalization performance. The experimental results show that performance of the proposed equalizer based on wavelet networks can significantly improve the neural modeling accuracy and outperform conventional neural network equalization in signal to noise ratio and channel non-linearity.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "24", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "Feb. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "24 - 29"}, "authors": ["Minghu Jiang", "Beixing Deng", "Gielen Georges"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Adaptive equalizers", "Delay", "Neural networks", "Vectors", "Wavelet transforms", "adaptive equalization", "orthogonal least square (OLS)", "wavelet neural networks (WNNs)", ""], "arnumber": "6075626"}
