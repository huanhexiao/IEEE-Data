In our present study, apoptosis induced by high concentrations of nicotinamide was observed in tobacco suspension cells. When cells were preincubated with 250 mmol/L nicotinamide for 24 h, the hallmarks of apoptosis were detected, including DNA fragments increasing in size by multiples of 180\u2013200 bp, the condensation and peripheral distribution of nuclear chromatin, and a positive reaction to the TUNEL assay. At the same time, the degradation of PARP and the reduction in the potential of the inner membrane of mitochondria appeared in apoptotic cells induced by high concentrations of nicotinamide. This result indicates that apoptosis induced by high concentrations of nicotinamide is associated with caspase-3-like activity and with the opening of mitochondrial permeability pores. These results partially support the hypothesis that high concentrations of PARP inhibitor could force cells to enter an apoptotic pathway by delay of DNA repair in replicating cells.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "88", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "93", "date_publication": "Feb. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "88 - 93"}, "authors": ["Guiyou Zhang", "Ruiyu Zhu", "Yaoren Dai"], "keywords": ["Animals", "Cells (biology)", "DNA", "Inhibitors", "Maintenance engineering", "Microscopy", "Suspensions", "apoptosis", "nicotinamide", "poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase", "tobacco suspension cell", ""], "arnumber": "6075636"}
