In this work, a method was developed to construct a color overlay, which enables clients to receive data across multiple paths, based on the forward error correction technique. The color overlay enlarges system capacity by reducing the bottlenecks and extending the bandwidth, improves reliability against node failure, and is more resilient to fluctuations of network metrics. A light-weight protocol for building the overlay is also presented. Extensive simulations were conducted and the results clearly support the claimed advantages.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "416", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "421", "date_publication": "Aug. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "416 - 421"}, "authors": ["Xiaoyu Zhang", "Guobin Shen", "Shipeng Li", "Yuzhuo Zhong"], "keywords": ["Bandwidth", "Bit rate", "Delay", "Image color analysis", "Peer to peer computing", "Reliability", "Vegetation", "application layer multicast", "forward error correction", "multi-path", ""], "arnumber": "6075703"}
