The stability of the group explicit method is proven strictly. The method has second-order accuracy and good stability. This explicit scheme can be used to solve all Reynolds number convection-dominated diffusion problems. A numerical test using a parallel computer shows high efficiency. The numerical results conform closely to the analytic solution.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "468", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "471", "date_publication": "Aug. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "468 - 471"}, "authors": ["Xiaoyu Liu", "Kai Zhao", "Jinfu Lu"], "keywords": ["Computers", "Educational institutions", "Equations", "Mathematical model", "Numerical stability", "Parallel algorithms", "Stability analysis", "group explicit scheme", "quad convection diffusion equation", "upwind scheme", ""], "arnumber": "6075711"}
