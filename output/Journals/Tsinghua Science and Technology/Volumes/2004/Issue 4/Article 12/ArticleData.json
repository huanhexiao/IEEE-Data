This paper presents a new scheme for multiple source video streaming in which the traditional fine granular scalable coding was rebuilt into a multiple sub-streams based transmission model. A peak signal to noise ratio based stream rate allocation algorithm was then developed based on the transmission model. In tests, the algorithm performance is about 1 dB higher than that of a uniform rate allocation algorithm. Therefore, this scheme can overcome bottlenecks along a single link and smooth jitter to achieve high quality and stable video.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "435", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "440", "date_publication": "Aug. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "435 - 440"}, "authors": ["Yanhong Ji", "Changjie Guo", "Yuzhuo Zhong", "Lifeng Sun"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Bandwidth", "Bit rate", "Receivers", "Resource management", "Streaming media", "Vectors", "fine granular scalable coding", "multiple sources video streaming", "stream rate allocation algorithm", ""], "arnumber": "6075706"}
