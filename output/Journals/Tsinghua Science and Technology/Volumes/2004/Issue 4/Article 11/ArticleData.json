However, supervised learning classification is not suitable for interval-scaled attributes, such as age and survival outcome of cancer patients. For this problem, this paper proposed a new method by combining two well-known methods: principal component analysis (PCA) and Fisher analysis (FA). The method, PCA-FA, realizes supervised learning with two types of attributes (nominal attributes and intervalscaled attributes). The fuzzy FA was introduced to model the interval-scaled attributes. In this paper, an approximate linear relationship between gene expression data of lung adenocarcinoma patients and survival outcome is successfully revealed by PCA-TA.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "428", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "434", "date_publication": "Aug. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "428 - 434"}, "authors": ["Shifeng Weng", "Changshui Zhang", "Xuegong Zhang"], "keywords": ["Correlation", "Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions", "Gene expression", "Lungs", "Principal component analysis", "Supervised learning", "Tumors", "Fisher analysis", "gene expression data", "principal component analysis", "supervised learning", ""], "arnumber": "6075705"}
