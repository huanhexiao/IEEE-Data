A novel case-based immune framework was developed for static and dynamic job-shop problems, using the associative memory and knowledge reuse from case-based reasoning (CBR) and immune response mechanisms. A 2-level similarity index which combines both job routing and problem solution characteristics based on DNA matching ideas was defined for both the CBR and immune algorithms. A CBR-embedded immune algorithms (CBR-IAs) framework was then developed focusing on case retrieval and adaptation methods. In static environments, the CBR-IAs have excellent population diversity and fast convergence which are necessary for dynamic problems with jobs arriving and leaving continually. The results with dynamic scheduling problems further confirm the CBR-IAs effectiveness as a problem solving method with knowledge reuse.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "422", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "427", "date_publication": "Aug. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "422 - 427"}, "authors": ["Wenjun Yin", "Min Liu", "Cheng Wu"], "keywords": ["Cognition", "Dynamic scheduling", "Genetics", "Heuristic algorithms", "Indexes", "Routing", "Search problems", "2-level similarity", "case-based reasoning", "dynamic job-shop scheduling", "immune algorithm", "machine learning", ""], "arnumber": "6075704"}
