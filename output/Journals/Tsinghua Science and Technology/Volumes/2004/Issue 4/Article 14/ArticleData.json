Recent advances in studies of three kinds of electrostatic potentials of mean force, three kinds of internal energies (ion-ion, ion-dipole, and dipole-dipole interactions), and three kinds of electrolyte models (primitive, non-primitive, and solvent primitive models) are introduced. The advantages and disadvantages between primitive and non-primitive models, and between MSA and perturbation theory are discussed. Some new equations of state (EOSs) based on MSA and perturbation theory for real electrolyte solutions are introduced. The one-Yukawa EOS and the two-Yukawa EOS for charged colloid systems are presented.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "444", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "454", "date_publication": "Aug. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "444 - 454"}, "authors": ["Yigui Li"], "keywords": ["Computational modeling", "Electric potential", "Equations", "Force", "Ions", "Mathematical model", "Solvents", "electrolyte solutions", "equation of state", "mean spherical approximation", "molecular simulation", "perturbation theory", "primitive and non-primitive models", "statistical mechanics", ""], "arnumber": "6075708"}
