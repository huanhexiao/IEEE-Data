This paper presents a traffic queueing model for resilient packet ring (RPR) networks and a method for quantitatively analyzing queueing delays in RPR nodes. The method was used to calculate the average queueing delays of different priority traffic for different transit queue modes. The simulations show that, in the transmit direction, lower priority traffic is delayed more than higher priority traffic, and that Class-A traffic is delayed more in a single-queue ring than in a dual-queue ring. In the transit direction, the secondary transit buffer in the dual-queue ring contributes more to the traffic delay than the primary transit buffer in the single-queue ring, which in turn causes more delay than the primary transit buffer in the dual-queue ring.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "406", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "409", "date_publication": "Aug. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "406 - 409"}, "authors": ["Guowei Shi", "Hongbo Fang", "Jianling Qu", "Lieguang Zeng"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Delay", "Mathematical model", "Periodic structures", "Protocols", "Queueing analysis", "Scheduling", "queueing delay", "queueing model", "resilient packet ring", ""], "arnumber": "6075701"}
