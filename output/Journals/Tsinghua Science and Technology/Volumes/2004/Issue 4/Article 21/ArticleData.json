To increase the prospects of successful BPR implementation, the role of information technology in BPR should be thoroughly investigated to find the logical relationships between information technology and BPR. This study used a survey methodology to gather information from 72 BPR programs. The results show that different information technologies, such as those examined in this study, electronic data interchange (EDI) and Internet, provide different capabilities and can be useful in different ways and for different purposes. Lack of attention to these relationships may be due to the unacceptable high implementation failure rate in the previous BPR efforts.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "489", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "496", "date_publication": "Aug. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "489 - 496"}, "authors": ["Hamid Reza Ahadi"], "keywords": ["Business process re-engineering", "Companies", "Information technology", "Internet", "Productivity", "business process reengineering", "information technology", "organizational enablers", ""], "arnumber": "6075715"}
