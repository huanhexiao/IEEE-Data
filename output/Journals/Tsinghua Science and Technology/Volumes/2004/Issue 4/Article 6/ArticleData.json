Delayed postprandial hypertriglyceridemia, diabetic gastroparesis, and the possible links between them were investigated using alloxan-induced diabetic mice. After the oral administration of olive oil, delayed and exaggerated postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and diabetic gastroparesis were markedly presented in alloxan-induced diabetic mice. Domperidone shortened the time of triglycerides (TG) peak levels in diabetic mice. After intraperitoneal and intraduodenal administration of olive oil, no delay of TG peak levels occurred in diabetic mice. Simultaneously, serum post-heparin lipoprotein lipase activities significantly decreased just at the time of prolonged and elevated TG peak levels resulting from diabetic gastroparesis, and further deteriorated postprandial hypertriglyceridemia in diabetic mice. The results indicate that diabetic gastroparesis can be one of the important reasons for delayed and exaggerated postprandial hypertriglyceridemia in diabetes mellitus.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "397", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "405", "date_publication": "Aug. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "397 - 405"}, "authors": ["Weidong Xie", "Dongming Xing", "Hui Su", "Jie Cheng", "Wen Jin", "Yi Ding", "Lijun Du"], "keywords": ["Blood", "Diabetes", "Gastrointestinal tract", "Mice", "Plasmas", "Sugar", "diabetic gastroparesis", "domperidone", "lipoprotein lipase", "olive oil", "postprandial hypertriglyceridemia", ""], "arnumber": "6075700"}
