A theoretical model of the mixed frequency phased array based on the interference principle was used to simulate the array's sound distribution. The pressure intensity in the array focal area was enhanced and the scanning area having effective contrast resolution was enlarged. The system is especially useful for high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) with more powerful energy and ultrasound imaging diagnostics with improved signal to noise ratios, improved beam forming and more uniform imaging quality.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "578", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "582", "date_publication": "Oct. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "578 - 582"}, "authors": ["Yong Xiang", "Jian Huo", "Keren Shi", "Yifang Chen"], "keywords": ["Acoustics", "Arrays", "Frequency control", "Nondestructive testing", "Pistons", "Transducers", "Ultrasonic imaging", "mixed phased array", "nondestructive testing and evaluation (NDT&#x0026", "E)", "ultrasound testing", ""], "arnumber": "6075730"}
