X-ray micro-diffraction technique was applied to the post-peened single crystal aluminum of (001) and (110) orientations, and X-ray profile was analyzed by sub-profiling and Fourier analysis method. Spatially resolved residual stress and strain deviation was quantified and explained in terms of the heterogeneous dislocation cell structure. In-plane crystal lattice rotation induced by \u00b5LSP was measured by electron\u00a0 backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and compared with the FEM simulation. Average mosaic size was evaluated from X-ray profile Fourier analysis and compared with the result from EBSD. Surface strength increase and dislocation cell structure formation were studied. The systematical characterization will lay the ground work for better understanding the effect of \u00b5LSP in microlength level and developing more realistic simulations.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "506", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "518", "date_publication": "Oct. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "506 - 518"}, "authors": ["Hongqiang Chen", "Youneng Wang", "Jeffrey W.
