In the past decade, more and more attention has been paid to the modeling and simulation of dendritic microstructures. This paper describes a modified diffusion-limited aggregation model to simulate the complex shape of the dendrite grains during metal solidification. The fractal model was used to simulate equiaxed dendrite growth. The fractal dimensions of simulated Al alloy structures range from 1.63\u20131.88 which compares well with the experimentally-measured fractal dimension of 1.85; therefore, the model accurately predicts not only the dendritic structure morphology, but also the fractal dimension of the dendrite structure formed during solidification.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "546", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "549", "date_publication": "Oct. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "546 - 549"}, "authors": ["Qingyan Xu", "Baicheng Liu"], "keywords": ["Fractals", "Materials", "Metals", "Microstructure", "Morphology", "Shape", "Solid modeling", "dendrite growth", "diffusion-limited aggregation model", "fractal theory", "metal solidification", ""], "arnumber": "6075723"}
