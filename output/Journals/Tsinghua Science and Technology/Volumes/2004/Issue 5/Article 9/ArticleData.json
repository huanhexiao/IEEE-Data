The model is based on the \u201crotation angle series fast wavelet transform\u201d algorithm developed for realtime digital signal processing. Instead of the traditional convolution-based algorithms, the algorithm uses a cascaded structure which can be quickly implemented on digital signal processors. The algorithm runs twice as fast as and is more flexible than the fast wavelet transform, and is applicable for multi-channel and phased array ultrasound systems. By using this algorithm, multi-channel ultrasound systems, including phased array ultrasound systems can have less complex software and hardware designs, lower cost, smaller size, and especially more powerful functions.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "565", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "569", "date_publication": "Oct. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "565 - 569"}, "authors": ["Xiufeng Zhang", "Keren Shi", "Li'nan Zheng"], "keywords": ["Discrete wavelet transforms", "Educational institutions", "Finite impulse response filter", "Signal processing algorithms", "Ultrasonic imaging", "nondestructive testing", "rotation angle series", "rotation angle series fast wavelet transform", "ultrasound", "wavelet", ""], "arnumber": "6075727"}
