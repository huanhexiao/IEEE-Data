Seven types of structure details were tested using a 2000-kN hydraulic-pressure-servo fatigue machine to imitate fatigue behavior in modern steel-truss-structures fabricated using thicker welded steel plates and integral joint technology. The details included longitudinal edge welds, welded attachment affecting detail, integral joint, and weld repairs on plate edges. The fatigue damage locations show that the stress (normal or shear), the shape, and the location of the weld start and end points are three major factors reducing the fatigue strength. The test results can be used for similar large structures.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "583", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "588", "date_publication": "Oct. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "583 - 588"}, "authors": ["Yuling Zhang", "Jiyan Pan", "Jiluan Pan"], "keywords": ["Certification", "Equations", "Fatigue", "Maintenance engineering", "Steel", "Stress", "Welding", "fatigue detail", "fatigue equations", "fatigue sample size", "weld steel truss", ""], "arnumber": "6075731"}
