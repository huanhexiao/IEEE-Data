In this paper, modeling and simulation technologies of solidification process of shape casting at microstructure-scale, especially deterministic, cellular automaton, and phase field models are studied and reviewed.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "497", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "505", "date_publication": "Oct. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "497 - 505"}, "authors": ["Baicheng Liu", "Qingyan Xu"], "keywords": ["Automata", "Casting", "Computational modeling", "Mathematical model", "Microstructure", "Solid modeling", "Stochastic processes", "Monte Carlo method", "cellular automaton", "deterministic model", "microstructure modeling", "phase field", "stochastic model", ""], "arnumber": "6075719"}
