The latent heat of the pure metal was treated using the temperature recovery method and the latent heat of the alloy was treated using an apparent heat capacity method. The model was validated by calculating the classical Stefan moving boundary problem. Analysis of the solid shell growth and temperature distribution of a billet in a mold shows that the solution by the finite point meshless model is quite reasonable, which indicates that the model has potential in metallurgical engineering applications.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "570", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "573", "date_publication": "Oct. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "570 - 573"}, "authors": ["Lei Zhang", "Jinwu Kang", "Houfa Shen", "Tianyou Huang"], "keywords": ["Billets", "Boundary conditions", "Casting", "Heat transfer", "Heating", "Numerical models", "Solid modeling", "continuous casting", "finite point method", "meshless", "mold", "solidification", ""], "arnumber": "6075728"}
