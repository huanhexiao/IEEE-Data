An expression was developed for the transient compression modulus of sand during compression. Based on the hypothesis put forward of the compression state, the differential equation for the nonlinear constitutive equation was deduced by introducing a move-yield potential function. The state constitutive equation under the tri-axial experiment is further studied according to the sand attributes, considering the differential form of Hooke's law and the Mohr-Coulomb condition. The related experiment data are applied to verify the proposed constitutive model of sand.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "560", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "564", "date_publication": "Oct. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "560 - 564"}, "authors": ["Pan Zeng", "Jin Kong"], "keywords": ["Educational institutions", "Equations", "Materials", "Mathematical model", "Soil", "Strain", "Stress", "constitutive equation", "green sand", "tri-axial experiment", ""], "arnumber": "6075726"}
