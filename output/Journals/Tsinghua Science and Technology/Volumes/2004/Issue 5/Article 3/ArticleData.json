To achieve self-maintenance intelligence, robust and fast learning algorithms need to be embedded in machine for real-time decision. This paper presents a credit-assignment cerebellar model articulation controller (CA-CMAC) algorithm to reduce learning interference in machine learning. The developed algorithms on credit matrix and the credit correlation matrix are presented. The error of the training sample distributed to the activated memory cell is proportional to the cell's credibility, which is determined by its activated times. The convergence processes of CA-CMAC in cyclic learning are further analyzed with two convergence theorems. In addition, simulation results on the inverse kinematics of 2-degree-of-freedom planar robot arm are used to prove the convergence theorems and show that CA-CMAC converges faster than conventional machine learning.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "519", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "526", "date_publication": "Oct. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "519 - 526"}, "authors": ["Lei Zhang", "Jay Lee", "Qixin Cao", "Lei Wang"], "keywords": ["Convergence", "Machine learning", "Machine learning algorithms", "Noise", "Symmetric matrices", "Training", "Vectors", "cerebellar model articulation controller", "machine learning", "self-learning", "self-maintenance machine", ""], "arnumber": "6075721"}
