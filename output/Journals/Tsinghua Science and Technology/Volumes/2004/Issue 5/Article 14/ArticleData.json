A specific method for designing small manufacturing cells was developed especially for the press production lines, which is computationally simple, and yet considers product demand and the operating sequences. A simulated application illustrates the robustness of the layouts to demand changes. The method uses simple rules and database tools, so it is accessible to a wide range of facilities.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "589", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "595", "date_publication": "Oct. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "589 - 595"}, "authors": ["Jianfeng Chang", "Yuexian Zhong", "Zandong Han"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Databases", "Layout", "Manufacturing", "Presses", "Robustness", "cells", "demand", "press", "sequence", "simulation", ""], "arnumber": "6075732"}
