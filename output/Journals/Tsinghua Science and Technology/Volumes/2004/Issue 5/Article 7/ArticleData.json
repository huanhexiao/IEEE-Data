The numerical simulation of the metal quenching process was based on the metallo-thermo-mechanical theory using the finite element method to couple the temperature, phase transformation, and stress-strain fields. The numerical models are presented for the heat treatment and kinetics of the phase transformation. The finite element models and the phase transition kinetics accurately predict the distribution of the microstructure volume fractions, the temperature, the distortion, and the stress-strain relation during quenching. The two examples used to validate the models are the quenching of a small gear and of a large turbine rotor. The simulation results for the martensite phase volume fraction, the stresses, and the distortion in the gear agree well with the experimental data. The models can be used to optimize the quenching conditions to ensure product quality.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "555", "volume": "9", "lastpage": "559", "date_publication": "Oct. 2004", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2004", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "555 - 559"}, "authors": ["Gang Fang", "Pan Zeng"], "keywords": ["Carbon", "Finite element methods", "Gears", "Numerical models", "Rotors", "Strain", "Stress", "finite element method", "gear", "heat treatment", "quenching", "turbine rotor", ""], "arnumber": "6075725"}
