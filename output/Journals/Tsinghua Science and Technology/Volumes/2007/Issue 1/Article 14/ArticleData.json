Based on an expected value criterion or a credibility criterion, a fuzzy expected value model and a fuzzy dependent chance programming (DCP) model are constructed. The purpose of the fuzzy expected value model is to find the optimal order quantity such that the fuzzy expected value of the total cost is minimal. The fuzzy DCP model is used to find the optimal order quantity for maximizing the credibility of an event such that the total cost in the planning periods does not exceed a certain budget level. Fuzzy simulations are designed to calculate the expected value of the fuzzy objective function and the credibility of each fuzzy event. A particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based on a fuzzy simulation is designed, by integrating the fuzzy simulation and the PSO algorithm. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed algorithm.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "91", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "96", "date_publication": "Feb. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "91 - 96"}, "authors": ["Xiaobin Wang", "Wansheng Tang", "Ruiqing Zhao"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Biological system modeling", "Economics", "Fuzzy set theory", "Numerical models", "Programming", "dependent chance programming", "fuzzy simulation", "fuzzy variable", "inventory", "particle swarm optimization", ""], "arnumber": "6076184"}
