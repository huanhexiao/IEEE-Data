The system avoids placing highly correlated users in space into the same spatial multiplexing group. This paper describes a user spatial compatibility evaluation criterion based on channel matrix structure analysis. The interferences are evaluated using the distances between subspaces spanned by the users' channel matrixes. The analysis considers row space and column space. Simulation results show that the row space distance criterion significantly outperforms other criteria because it fully utilizes the information from the users' channel matrixes. As the dimensions of the users' channel matrixes increase, the matrix structure analysis-based criteria become even more efficient.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "111", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "114", "date_publication": "Feb. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "111 - 114"}, "authors": ["Zhisheng Niu", "Lei Li"], "keywords": ["Approximation methods", "Interference", "MIMO", "Multiplexing", "Receiving antennas", "Vectors", "Wireless communication", "multiple input multiple output (MIMO)", "multiuser channel", "radio resource management", ""], "arnumber": "6076187"}
