A novel hybrid framework for this classification was developed in this work. A set of effective features derived from the coherence matrix of polarimetric SAR data was proposed. Constituents of the feature set are wavelet, texture, and nonlinear features. The proposed feature set has a strong discrimination power. A neural network was used as the classification engine in a unique way. By exploiting the speed of the conjugate gradient method and the convergence rate of the Levenberg-Marquardt method (near the optimal point), an overall speed up of the classification procedure was achieved. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to shrink the dimension of the feature vector without sacrificing much of the classification accuracy. The proposed approach is compared with the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) based on the complex Wishart distribution and the results show the superiority of the proposed method, with the average classification accuracy by the proposed method (95.4%) higher than that of the MLE (93.77%). Use of PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the feature vector helps reduce the memory requirements and computational cost, thereby enhancing the speed of the process.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "97", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "104", "date_publication": "Feb. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "97 - 104"}, "authors": ["Kamran Ullah Khan", "Jian Yang"], "keywords": ["Artificial neural networks", "Biological neural networks", "Neurons", "Principal component analysis", "Support vector machine classification", "Training", "Vectors", "(PCA)", "neural network", "principal component analysis", "undecimated discrete wavelet transform (UDWT)", ""], "arnumber": "6076185"}
