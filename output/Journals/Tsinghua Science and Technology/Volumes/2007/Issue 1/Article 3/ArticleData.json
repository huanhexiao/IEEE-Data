Multiple multi-layer neural networks are employed to approximate the uncertainty of the nonlinear functions, and robustifying control terms are used to compensate for approximation errors. All parameter adaptive laws and robustifying control terms are derived based on Lyapunov stability analysis so that, under appropriate assumptions, semi-global stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed, and the tracking error asymptotically converges to zero. Simulations performed on a two-link robot manipulator illustrate the approach and its performance.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "21", "date_publication": "Feb. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "14 - 21"}, "authors": ["Tingliang Hu", "Jihong Zhu", "Zengqi Sun"], "keywords": ["Adaptive control", "MIMO", "Neural networks", "Nonlinear dynamical systems", "Robustness", "Vectors", "direct adaptive control", "neural networks", "nonlinear system", "stability", ""], "arnumber": "6076173"}
