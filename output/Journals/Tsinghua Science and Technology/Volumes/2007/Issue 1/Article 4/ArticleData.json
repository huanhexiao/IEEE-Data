An improved compression and decompression structure is described. The captured CFA raw data are firstly lowpass filtered in RGB space by a smooth filter followed by a down-sampling operation. Next, the data are transformed from RGB space to YCbCr space. Lastly, the filtered data in YCbCr space are compressed directly before full color interpolation to avoid redundancy. The presented method can provide a lower compression ratio and has lower complexity than both conventional interpolation-first image compression methods and other similar existing compression-first methods.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "22", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "Feb. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "22 - 29"}, "authors": ["Xiang Xie", "Guolin Li", "Zhihua Wang"], "keywords": ["Arrays", "Color", "Image coding", "Image color analysis", "Low pass filters", "Transform coding", "Bayer color filter array (CFA)", "lossy image compression", "low pass filter", "quincunx pattern", ""], "arnumber": "6076174"}
