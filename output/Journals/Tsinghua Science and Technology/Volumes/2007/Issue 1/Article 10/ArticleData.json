Re-synthesis after floorplan is expected to be very helpful for reducing the interconnect delay of a circuit. In this paper, a force-balance-based re-synthesis algorithm for interconnect delay optimization after floorplan is proposed. The algorithm optimizes the interconnect delay by changing the operation scheduling and the functional unit allocation and binding. With this method the number and positions of all functional units are not changed, but some operations are allocated or bound to different units. Preliminary experimental results show that the interconnect wire delays are reduced efficiently without destroying the floorplan performance.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "63", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "69", "date_publication": "Feb. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "63 - 69"}, "authors": ["Yunfeng Wang", "Jinian Sian", "Xianlong Hong", "Qiang Zhou", "Qiang Wu"], "keywords": ["Delay", "Integrated circuit interconnections", "Registers", "Resource management", "Simulated annealing", "Wires", "floorplan", "high level synthesis", "interconnect delay", "re-synthesis", "reallocation", "reschedule", ""], "arnumber": "6076180"}
