The scheme uses the standard video encoder with a pre-processing stage to generate multiple descriptions. The decoder then uses a post-processing algorithm to combine the descriptions to provide better image quality. A scalable codec in the MDC system allows the system to provide multiple descriptions and scalability at the same time. In addition, since the different scalable descriptions may have different qualities, a simple averaging process is not optimal. An optimal weighted combination of the two descriptions was developed based on the signal to noise ratios. Compared with the simple average combination, the algorithm significantly improved the video quality, especially with large quality differences between the two descriptions, with gains of up to 3.56 dB.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "86", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "90", "date_publication": "Feb. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "86 - 90"}, "authors": ["Anbang Zhao", "Wensheng Wang", "Huijuan Cui", "Kun Tang"], "keywords": ["Codecs", "Educational institutions", "Encoding", "PSNR", "Streaming media", "Video coding", "fine grained scalable video coding", "multiple description video coding", "video transmission", ""], "arnumber": "6076183"}
