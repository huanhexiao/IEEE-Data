Without any excitation conditions, only the convergence rate of the common LS algorithm can be obtained. This paper analyzed the weighted least-squares (WLS) algorithm and described the good properties of the WLS algorithm. The WLS algorithm was then used for adaptive control of linear stochastic systems to show that the linear closed-loop system was globally stable and that the system identification was consistent. Compared to the past optimal adaptive controller, this controller does not impose restricted conditions on the coefficients of the system, such as knowing the first coefficient before the controller. Without any persistent excitation conditions, the analysis shows that, with the regulation of the adaptive control, the closed-loop system was globally stable and the adaptive controller converged to the one-step-ahead optimal controller in some sense.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "105", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "110", "date_publication": "Feb. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "105 - 110"}, "authors": ["Rui Jiang", "Guiming Luo"], "keywords": ["Adaptation models", "Adaptive control", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Educational institutions", "Software algorithms", "Stochastic systems", "globally stable", "optimal adaptive control", "stochastic system", "weighted least-squares (WLS) algorithm", ""], "arnumber": "6076186"}
