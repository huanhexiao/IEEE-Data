The model is a finite mixture with the ARMA component and external inputs. In this paper we focus on a parameter estimate of the ARMAX model. Classical modeling methods are usually based on the assumption that the driven noise in the moving average (MA) part has bounded variances, while in the model considered here the variances of noise may increase by a power of log n. The plant parameters are identified by the recursive stochastic gradient algorithm. The diminishing excitation technique and some results of martingale difference theory are adopted in order to prove the convergence of the identification. Finally, some simulations are given to show the reliability of the theoretical results.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "38", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "43", "date_publication": "Feb. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "38 - 43"}, "authors": ["Ya Jin", "Guiming Luo"], "keywords": ["Adaptive control", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Autoregressive processes", "Biological system modeling", "Convergence", "Signal processing algorithms", "Stochastic processes", "convergence", "increasing variance", "multidimensional autoregressive moving average exogenous (ARMAX) process", "stochastic gradient algorithm", ""], "arnumber": "6076176"}
