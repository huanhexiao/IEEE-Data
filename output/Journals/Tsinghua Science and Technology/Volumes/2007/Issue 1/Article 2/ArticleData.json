The algorithm has better robustness than conventional least squares which can amplify the errors of inaccurate data. The M-estimator places particular emphasis on reducing the effects of large data errors, which are further overcome by an iterative regression process which gives small weights to large off-group data errors and large weights to small data errors. Simulation results are consistent with the hypothesis with 81 groups of regression data having an average accuracy of 3.5%, which demonstrates that the M-estimator provides more accurate and reliable data reconstruction.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "9", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "13", "date_publication": "Feb. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "9 - 13"}, "authors": ["Dan Liu", "Jinwei Sun", "Guo Wei"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Least squares approximation", "Minimization", "Reconstruction algorithms", "Sun", "Table lookup", "M-estimators", "data reconstruction", "least squares", "weighted least squares", ""], "arnumber": "6076172"}
