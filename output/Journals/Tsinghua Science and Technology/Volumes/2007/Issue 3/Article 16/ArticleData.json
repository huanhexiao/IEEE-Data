This paper introduced and reformulated the exact backprojection-filtration (BPF)-type reconstruction algorithm for fan-beam scans based on Zou and Pan's work. Subsequently, a legible and implementary BPF algorithm for region-of-interest (ROI) reconstruction is presented using projection data truncated not only in angle-scanning but also in the transverse direction. The algorithm can be widely used for fan-beam full-scans, short-scans, or super-short-scans. The algorithm uses less projection data than the preceding super-short-scan. The algorithm is implemented using the Shepp-Logan phantom and some primary results are presented. Some new discoveries and implications of ROI reconstruction from truncated data are discussed, which suggests that the BPF algorithm can be used in the ROI reconstruction from truncated projections.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "337", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "344", "date_publication": "June 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "337 - 344"}, "authors": ["Liang Li", "Zhiqiang Chen", "Kejun Kang", "Li Zhang"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Band pass filters", "Detectors", "Image reconstruction", "Image segmentation", "Reconstruction algorithms", "Trajectory", "PI-line", "backprojection-filtration (BPF)", "fan-beam", "region of interest (ROI)", "transverse truncation", ""], "arnumber": "6076223"}
