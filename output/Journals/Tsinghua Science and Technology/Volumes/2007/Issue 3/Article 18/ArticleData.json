The methods have also shown that momentum and price movements can coexist in an asset market with only rational agents. The purpose of this paper is to provide a rational economic theory to explain these phenomena. Results of a dynamic programming model with heterogeneous beliefs show that the dynamic interactions between information diffusion and belief changes create continuation and reversals. The duration and magnitude of momentum and price movements are associated with trading volume. Therefore, rational investors should incorporate price and volume information in their trading decisions.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "352", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "360", "date_publication": "June 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "352 - 360"}, "authors": ["Zhanhui Chen", "Xin Yang"], "keywords": ["Correlation", "Dynamic equilibrium", "Dynamic programming", "Dynamics", "Equations", "Stock markets", "anomalies", "heterogeneous belief", "rational expectation equilibrium", "trading volume", ""], "arnumber": "6076225"}
