The two-dimensional model equations, based on the time-dependent Reynolds averaged NavierStokes equations, are solved numerically using an implicit time integration in a fitted body grid arrangement to simulate stratified flow over an isolated ideally bell-shaped mountain. The simulation results are in good agreement with the existing corresponding analytical and approximate solutions. It is shown that for atmospheric conditions where non-hydrostatic effects become dominant, the model is able to reproduce typical flow features. The dispersion characteristics of gaseous pollutants in the stratified flow have also been studied. The dispersion patterns for two typical atmospheric conditions are compared. The results show that the presence of a gravity wave causes vertical stratification of the pollutant concentration and affects the diffusive characteristics of the pollutants.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "332", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "336", "date_publication": "June 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "332 - 336"}, "authors": ["Ling Li", "Shigeo Kimura"], "keywords": ["Atmospheric modeling", "Atmospheric waves", "Equations", "Fluids", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Surfaces", "complex topography", "internal gravity wave", "numerical method", "stratified flow", ""], "arnumber": "6076222"}
