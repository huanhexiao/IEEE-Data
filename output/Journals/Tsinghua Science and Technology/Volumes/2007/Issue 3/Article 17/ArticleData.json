The unsteady flow fields were computed by solving the filtered incompressible Navier-Stokes equations under low Mach number approximation by the finite difference method. The studies analyzed the influence of different street canyon configurations and aspect ratios on the flow and chlorine gas dispersion. The geometric configuration and aspect ratio both affect the vortices and the local concentration distributions in street canyons.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "345", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "351", "date_publication": "June 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "345 - 351"}, "authors": ["Rui Yang", "Jing Zhang", "Shifei Shen", "Xiaomeng Li", "Jianguo Chen"], "keywords": ["Boundary conditions", "Buildings", "Computational modeling", "Dispersion", "Geometry", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "dense gas", "dispersion", "large eddy simulation", "street canyon", ""], "arnumber": "6076224"}
