The optimum design based on the workspace was presented. Meanwhile, a global, comprehensive conditioning index was introduced to evaluate the kinematic designs. The optimal parallel manipulator is incorporated into a 5-DOF hybrid machine tool which includes a 2-D0F rotational milling head and a long movement worktable. The results show that the planar parallel manipulator-based machine tool can be successfully used to machine blades and guide vanes for a hydraulic turbine.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "269", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "275", "date_publication": "June 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "269 - 275"}, "authors": ["Jun Wu", "Tiemin Li", "Xinjun Liu", "Liping Wang"], "keywords": ["Blades", "Indexes", "Jacobian matrices", "Kinematics", "Machine tools", "Manipulators", "Vectors", "global conditioning index", "hybrid machine tool", "planar parallel manipulator", ""], "arnumber": "6076213"}
