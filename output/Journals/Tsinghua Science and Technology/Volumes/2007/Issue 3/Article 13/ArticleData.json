The efficiency of bicycle traffic in time and space at intersections was investigated for eight typical intersections in the cities of Tianjin, Shenyang, and Changchun, all in China, by means of video recording. Models were developed to calculate the through bicycle traffic and the left-turn bicycle traffic conversion factors in intersections where bicycles and motor vehicles share the same road. The results indicate that the through bicycle conversion factor is 0.28 and the left-turn bicycle conversion factor is 0.33. This conclusion differs from the current value used in China. More research on the conversion factor is necessary to evaluate the impact of intersections.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "318", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "323", "date_publication": "June 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "318 - 323"}, "authors": ["Dianhai Wang", "Chunyan Liang", "Chunguang Jing", "Guohua Wang"], "keywords": ["Bicycles", "Cities and towns", "Delay", "Educational institutions", "Roads", "bicycle conversion factor", "mixed traffic", "vehicle-bicycle conflicts", ""], "arnumber": "6076220"}
