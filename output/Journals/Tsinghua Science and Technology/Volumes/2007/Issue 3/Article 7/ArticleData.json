This paper presents a study of the reclaimation and reuse of nonmetallic materials recovered from waste PCBs. Mechanical processes, such as crushing, milling, and separation, were used to process waste PCBs. Nonmetallic materials in the PCBs were separated using density-based separation with separation rates in excess of 950/0. The recovered nonmetals were used to make models, construction materials, composite boards, sewer grates, and amusement park boats. The PCB nonmetal products have better mechanical characteristics and durability than traditional materials and fillers. The flexural strength of the PCB nonmetallic material composite boards is 30% greater than that of standard products. Products derived from PCB waste processing have been brought into industrial production. The study shows that PCB nonmetals can be reused in profitable and environmentally friendly ways.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "276", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "283", "date_publication": "June 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "276 - 283"}, "authors": ["Peng Mou", "Dong Xiang", "Guanghong Duan"], "keywords": ["Biological system modeling", "Glass", "Powders", "Recycling", "Resins", "Silicon compounds", "electronic waste", "printed circuit boards (PCBs)", "reclaimation", "reusing", ""], "arnumber": "6076214"}
