The main requirements for structure inspection are the full-field strain measurement with the required precision and on-site measurement ability. The digital correlation method (DCM), a new optical deformation measurement tool, can satisfy all of the requirements for structure inspection. A smoothing algorithm which can greatly improve the strain measurement precision, and a 3-D DCM have been developed in this paper. For verifying this improvement, a comparison of strain measurements by computer-simulated speckle images has been carried out. Additionally, three structure inspection examples that cover typical materials and structure styles are presented: the interface shear stress distribution for reinforced concrete piles bedded on rock, the 3-D strain distribution of a composite vessel structure, and stresses in a hookup that connects two steel bridge structures. All the examples show that the new structural inspection tool is exemplary and illustrates the obvious advantages of this optical non-destructive technique.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "237", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "243", "date_publication": "June 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "237 - 243"}, "authors": ["Junda Chen", "Guanchang Jin", "Libo Meng"], "keywords": ["Cameras", "Correlation", "Inspection", "Smoothing methods", "Speckle", "Strain", "Stress", "3-D strain measurements", "digital correlation method (DCM)", "optical non-destructive technique", "structure inspection", ""], "arnumber": "6076208"}
