This paper uses Karachi as a case study, which is the largest urban and economic centre of Pakistan, passing through an uncontrolled phase of rapid urbanization and motorization. The paper first reviews research related to sustainable transportation systems to comprehend the concept of sustainable development and transportation. The paper then evaluates the existing transportation and infrastructure system, national transportation policies, and urban transportation projects to determine if the current paradigm is moving toward or away from sustainable transportation. Furthermore, the principles for sustainable urban transportation are developed to see what significance national transportation policies have given to urban transportation from a sustainable transportation point of view. Finally some strategies are suggested, adoption of which may lead to a sustainable urban development and transportation system in Karachi.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "309", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "317", "date_publication": "June 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "309 - 317"}, "authors": ["Intikhab Ahmed Qureshi", "Huapu Lu"], "keywords": ["Cities and towns", "Economics", "Pollution", "Roads", "Sustainable development", "Vehicles", "integrated land use and urban transportation system", "motorization", "socio-economic", "sustainable development", "urbanization", ""], "arnumber": "6076219"}
