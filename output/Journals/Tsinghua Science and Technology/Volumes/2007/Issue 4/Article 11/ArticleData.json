Considering the characteristics of traditional waste disposal technologies and the subsequent secondary pollution, anaerobic digestion has various advantages such as reduction in the land needed for disposal and preservation of environmental quality. In light of the energy crisis, this paper focuses on the potential production of biogas from biowaste through anaerobic digestion processes, the problems incurred by the waste collection system, and the efficiency of the anaerobic digestion process. Use of biogas in a combined heat and power cogeneration system is also discussed. Finally, the advantages of anaerobic digestion technology for the Chinese market are summarized. The anaerobic digestion is suggested to be a promising treating technology for the organic wastes in China.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "435", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "440", "date_publication": "Aug. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "435 - 440"}, "authors": ["Jianguo Jiang", "Jichao Sui", "Shiyao Wu", "Ying Yang", "Liming Wang"], "keywords": ["Cities and towns", "Cogeneration", "Europe", "Inductors", "Solids", "Waste disposal", "Waste heat", "anaerobic digestion", "bio-waste", "cogeneration", "methane", ""], "arnumber": "6071775"}
