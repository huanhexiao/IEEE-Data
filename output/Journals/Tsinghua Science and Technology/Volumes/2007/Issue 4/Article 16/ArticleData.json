The five information sharing scenarios are centralized information sharing, full information sharing, supplier-dominated information sharing, retailer-dominated information sharing, and noninformation sharing. Iterative procedures are developed to obtain the inventory policies and the system costs at equilibrium points. Numerical examples show that the cost of a centralized inventory system is about 20%\u201340% lower than that of a decentralized system with non-information sharing. Furthermore, a higher information sharing level does not always lead to a lower system cost in a decentralized supply chain due to inventory competition.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "466", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "474", "date_publication": "Aug. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "466 - 474"}, "authors": ["Xiaobo Zhao", "Minmin Qiu"], "keywords": ["Games", "Iterative methods", "Markov processes", "Space stations", "Supply chains", "Markov decision process", "information sharing", "inventory ordering policy", ""], "arnumber": "6071780"}
