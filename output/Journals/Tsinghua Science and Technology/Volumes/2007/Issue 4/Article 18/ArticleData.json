By defining an equivalence relation through such operators on words as inverse, cyclically left shift, and mirror, it is straightforward to get that w\u223cw' implies tr w = trw'. We show by a counter example that tr w = tr w' does not imply w \u223c w'. And in two special cases, we prove that tr w = tr w' if and only if w \u223c w'.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "479", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "484", "date_publication": "Aug. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "479 - 484"}, "authors": ["Guizhen Wang"], "keywords": ["Barium", "Manganese", "Mirrors", "Polynomials", "Radiation detectors", "Video recording", "cyclically reduced word", "equivalence", "trace polynomial", ""], "arnumber": "6071782"}
