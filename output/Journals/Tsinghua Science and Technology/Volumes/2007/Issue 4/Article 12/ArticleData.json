Signal processing techniques were used to relate workpiece surface topography to the dynamic behavior of the machine tool. Spatial domain frequency analyses based on fast Fourier transform were used to analyze the tool behavior. Wavelet reconstruction was used for profile filtering. The results show that machine vibration remarkably affects the surface topography at small feed rates, but has negligible effect at high feed rates. The analyses also show how to control the surface quality during hard turning.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "441", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "446", "date_publication": "Aug. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "441 - 446"}, "authors": ["Haosheng Li", "Su Wu", "Kratz Hubert"], "keywords": ["Feeds", "Surface reconstruction", "Surface topography", "Surface waves", "Turning", "Vibrations", "fast Fourier transform (FFT)", "hard turning", "machine vibration", "surface topography", "wavelet", ""], "arnumber": "6071776"}
