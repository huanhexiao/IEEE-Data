This paper describes a relative gradient non-orthogonal approximate joint diagonalization (AJD) algorithm based on a non-least squares AJD criterion and a special AJD using a non-square diagonalizing matrix and an AJD method for ill-conditioned matrices. Simulation results demonstrate the better performance of the relative gradient AJD algorithm compared with the conventional least squares (LS) criteria based gradient-type AJD algorithms. The algorithm is attractive for practical applications since it is simple and efficient.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "669", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "673", "date_publication": "Dec. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "669 - 673"}, "authors": ["Xilin Li", "Xianda Zhang", "Peisheng Li"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Approximation algorithms", "Convergence", "Joints", "Least squares approximation", "Signal processing", "Signal processing algorithms", "adaptive signal processing", "approximate joint diagonalization", "decorrelation", "gradient methods", "statistics", ""], "arnumber": "6071816"}
