It avoids indirections of directory protocols for common cache-to-cache transfer misses, and achieves higher interconnect bandwidth and lower interconnect latency compared with snooping protocols. However, the broadcasting increases network traffic, limiting the scalability of token protocol. This paper describes an efficient technique to reduce the token protocol network traffic, called sharing relation cache. This cache provides destination set information for cache-to-cache miss requests by caching directory information for recent shared data. This paper introduces how to implement the technique in a token protocol. Simulations using SPLASH-2 benchmarks show that in a 16-core chip multiprocessor system, the cache reduced the network traffic by 15% on average.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "691", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "699", "date_publication": "Dec. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "691 - 699"}, "authors": ["Haixia Wang", "Dongsheng Wang", "Peng Li", "Jinglei Wang", "Chongmin Li"], "keywords": ["Coherence", "Information science", "Laboratories", "Multiprocessing systems", "Process control", "Protocols", "Writing", "network traffic", "sharing relation cache", "token protocol", ""], "arnumber": "6071820"}
