This multiuser detector allows the channel response to be stochastic in one symbol duration, which can be regarded as an effective method of MUD for fast fading CDMA systems. Performance analyses show that the multiuser detector is theoretically valid for CDMA systems over fast fading channels. Simulations show that the multiuser detector performs better than the Kalman filter-based multiuser detector with a faster convergence rate and lower bit error rate.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "663", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "668", "date_publication": "Dec. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "663 - 668"}, "authors": ["Ling Zhang", "Xianda Zhang"], "keywords": ["Bit error rate", "Detectors", "Fading", "Kalman filters", "Multiaccess communication", "Multiuser detection", "Noise", "code-division multiple-access", "fading channel", "multiplicative noise", "multiuser detection", "optimal filtering", ""], "arnumber": "6071815"}
