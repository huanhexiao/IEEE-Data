Thus, parallel FPM algorithms achieve better scalability and performance, so they are attracting much attention in the data mining research community. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art parallel and distributed frequent pattern mining algorithms with more emphasis on pattern discovery from complex data (e.g., sequences and graphs) on various platforms. A review of typical parallel FPM algorithms uncovers the major challenges, methodologies, and research problems in the field of parallel frequent pattern discovery, such as work-load balancing, finding good data layouts, and data decomposition. This survey also indicates a dramatic shift of the research interest in the field from the simple parallel frequent itemset mining on traditional parallel and distributed platforms to parallel pattern mining of more complex data on emerging architectures, such as multi-core systems and the increasingly mature grid infrastructure.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "719", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "728", "date_publication": "Dec. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "719 - 728"}, "authors": ["Yuzhou Zhang", "Jianyong Wang", "Lizhu Zhou"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Data mining", "Itemsets", "Lattices", "Load management", "Partitioning algorithms", "dynamic load balancing", "frequent pattern mining", "parallel computing", ""], "arnumber": "6071824"}
