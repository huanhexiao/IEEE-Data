Various CFO estimation methods have been developed to compensate for the CFO at the receiver. This paper describes a novel minimum output variance method for OFDM systems with CFO in additive white Gaussian noise channels. This method utilizes the phase and the amplitude of the received signal and reduces the mean square error of the CFO by about 3 dB compared with the original minimum output variance method.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "674", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "677", "date_publication": "Dec. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "674 - 677"}, "authors": ["Peisheng Li", "Xianda Zhang", "Yongtao Su", "Lu Wu"], "keywords": ["Cost function", "Estimation", "Frequency division multiplexing", "Frequency estimation", "Frequency modulation", "OFDM", "Signal processing algorithms", "additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)", "carrier frequency offset (CFO)", "minimum output variance (MOV)", "orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)", ""], "arnumber": "6071817"}
