This paper describes an iterative blind receiver consisting of a sequential Monte Carlo detector, a CFO estimator, and a compensator to reduce intercarrier interference. The framework is of low complexity due to the separation of tasks in a joint detection problem. In addition, the CFO estimator utilizes soft output of the sequential Monte Carlo detector, which reduces the information loss caused by hard decisions and can obtain the CFO estimate in only one OFDM symbol. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "678", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "683", "date_publication": "Dec. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "678 - 683"}, "authors": ["Yongtao Su", "Xianda Zhang", "Qiubin Gao", "Zizhe Ding"], "keywords": ["Demodulation", "Detectors", "Estimation", "Frequency division multiplexing", "Monte Carlo methods", "OFDM", "Receivers", "blind receiver", "carrier frequency offset (CFO)", "orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)", "sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)", ""], "arnumber": "6071818"}
