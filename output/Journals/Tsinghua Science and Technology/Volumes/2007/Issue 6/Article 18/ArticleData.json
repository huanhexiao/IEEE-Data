The thin Ge-rich SiGe buffer layer was achieved through a combination of ultrahigh vacuum chemical vapor deposition (UHVCVD) SiGe epitaxial growth and SiGe oxidation. A lower Ge content strained SiGe layer was first grown on the Si (001) substrate and then the Ge mole fraction was increased by oxidation. After removal of the surface oxide, a higher Ge content SiGe layer was grown and oxidized again. The Ge mole fraction was increased to 0.8 in the 50 nm thick SiGe layer. Finally a 150 nm thick pure Ge film was grown on the SiGe buffer layer using the UHVCVD system. This technique produces a much thinner buffer than the conventional compositionally graded relaxed SiGe method with the same order of magnitude threading dislocation density.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "747", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "751", "date_publication": "Dec. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "747 - 751"}, "authors": ["Jialei Liu", "Renrong Liang", "Jing Wang", "Yang Xu", "Jun Xu", "Zhihong Liu"], "keywords": ["Buffer layers", "Oxidation", "Rough surfaces", "Silicon", "Silicon germanium", "Surface roughness", "SiGe buffer", "oxidation", "pure Ge", "ultrahigh vacuum chemical vapor deposition", ""], "arnumber": "6071827"}
