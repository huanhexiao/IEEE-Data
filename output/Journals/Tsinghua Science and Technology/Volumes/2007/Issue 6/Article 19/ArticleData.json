Accurate modeling of T-lines to capture the related electrical effects has, therefore, become increasingly important. This paper describes a method to model the capacitance and conductance of T-Lines on CMOS multilayer, lossy substrates based on conformal mapping, and region subdivision. Tests show that the line parameters (per unit length) obtained by the method are frequency dependent and very accurate. The method is also suitable for parallel multiconductor interconnect modeling for high frequency circuits.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "752", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "756", "date_publication": "Dec. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "752 - 756"}, "authors": ["Zuochang Ye", "Wenjian Yu", "Zhiping Yu"], "keywords": ["Approximation methods", "CMOS integrated circuits", "Capacitance", "Conductors", "Dielectrics", "Permittivity", "Substrates", "capacitance", "circuit characteristics", "frequency dependence", "radio frequency complementry mental-oxide semiconductor (RF-CMOS)", "transmission lines", ""], "arnumber": "6071828"}
