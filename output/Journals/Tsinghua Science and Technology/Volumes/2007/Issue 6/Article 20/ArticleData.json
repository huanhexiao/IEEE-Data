A self-phase modulation-based reshaper was used after the adiabatic soliton compression in a comb-like dispersion profiled fiber. Experiments and simulations confirm that the reshaper effectively removes the pulse pedestal and improves the pulse extinction ratio. As a result, the 10-GHz pulse had no pedestal, a high extinction ratio, and a pulse width of only 1.4 ps.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "757", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "760", "date_publication": "Dec. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "757 - 760"}, "authors": ["Yanfu Yang", "Caiyun Lou"], "keywords": ["Chirp", "Optical fiber communication", "Optical fiber dispersion", "Optical fibers", "Pulse generation", "Solitons", "pulse pedestal", "self-phase modulation", "soliton compression", "ultrashort pulse generation", ""], "arnumber": "6071829"}
