This paper presents an agent-based middleware for providing context-aware services for smart spaces to afford effective support for context acquisition, representation, interpretation, and utilization to applications. The middleware uses a formal context model, which combines first order probabilistic logic (FOPL) and web ontology language (OWL) ontologies, to provide a common understanding of contextual information to facilitate context modeling and reasoning about imperfect and ambiguous contextual information and to enable context knowledge sharing and reuse. A context inference mechanism based on an extended Bayesian network approach is used to enable automated reactive and deductive reasoning. The middleware is used in a case study in a smart classroom, and performance evaluation result shows that the context reasoning algorithm is good for non-time-critical applications and that the complexity is highly sensitive to the size of the context dataset.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "707", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "713", "date_publication": "Dec. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "707 - 713"}, "authors": ["Weijun Qin", "Yuanchun Shi", "Yue Suo"], "keywords": ["Context", "Context modeling", "Middleware", "Ontologies", "Probabilistic logic", "Sensors", "Unified modeling language", "context model", "context-aware system", "first-order probabilistic logic", "ontology", "smart spaces", ""], "arnumber": "6071822"}
