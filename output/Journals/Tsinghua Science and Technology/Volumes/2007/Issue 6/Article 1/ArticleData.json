The algorithm is based on constrained state feedback and Monte-Carlo simulations. The computational complexity of the algorithm increases linearly with increasing the number of species in a gene regulation system. An estimate is derived for the confidence level of the predicted minimum required perturbation strength when targets are prescribed a priori. The algorithm has been used to analyze the cell cycle of Xenopus frog eggs. The results agree well with available results for single target perturbations, and multitarget interference is usually not equal to the summation of the single-target interferences.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "629", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "637", "date_publication": "Dec. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "629 - 637"}, "authors": ["Tong Zhou", "Shao Li"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Biology", "Interference", "Numerical stability", "Prediction algorithms", "Stability analysis", "Vectors", "Monte-Carlo method", "cell cycle", "constrained state feedback", "drug discovery", "intracellular regulation network", "uniform distribution", ""], "arnumber": "6071810"}
