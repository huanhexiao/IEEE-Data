An ANN structure with feedback was designed to use different learning algorithms in the different ANN layers. This actually forms a Turbo iteration process between the different algorithms which effectively improves the estimation performance of the channel equalizer. Simulation results show that this channel equalization algorithm has better computational efficiency and faster convergence than higher order statistics based algorithms.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "658", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "662", "date_publication": "Dec. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "658 - 662"}, "authors": ["Ling Zhang", "Xianda Zhang"], "keywords": ["Artificial neural networks", "Channel estimation", "Equalizers", "Estimation", "Kalman filters", "MIMO", "Vectors", "artificial neural networks", "channel equalization", "channel estimation", "multiple input multiple output", "symbol estimation", ""], "arnumber": "6071814"}
