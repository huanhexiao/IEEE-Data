This paper describes two implementations of the HdBNM, the singular hybrid boundary node method (ShBNM) and the regular hybrid boundary node method (RhBNM). The ShBNM and RhBNM were compared with each other, and the parameters that influence their performance were studied in detail. The convergence rates and their applicability to thin structures were also investigated. The ShBNM and RhBNM are found to be very easy to implement and to efficiently obtain numerical solutions to computational mechanics problems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "509", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "519", "date_publication": "Oct. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "509 - 519"}, "authors": ["Jianming Zhang", "Masa Tanaka", "Zhenhan Yao"], "keywords": ["Educational institutions", "Finite element methods", "Geometry", "Interpolation", "Least squares approximation", "Shape", "hybrid boundary node method", "meshless methods", "moving least", "squares approximation", ""], "arnumber": "6071789"}
