The mechanical properties of such composites depend strongly on micro-structural parameters. This paper presents a new boundary element method (BEM) for numerical analysis of the mechanical properties of 3-D fiberreinforced composites. Acceleration of the BEM is achieved by means of a fast multipole method (FMM), in allowing large scale simulations of a finite elastic domain containing up to 100 elastic fibers to be performed on one personal computer. The maximum number of degrees of freedom can reach a value of over 250 000. The effects of several key micro-structural parameters on the local stress fields and on the effective elastic moduli of fiber-reinforced composites are evaluated. The numerical results are compared with analytical predictions and good agreement is observed. The results show that the fast multipole BEM could be a promising tool for further understanding of the mechanical behavior of such composites.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "554", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "561", "date_publication": "Oct. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "554 - 561"}, "authors": ["Haitao Wang", "Zhenhan Yao"], "keywords": ["Computational modeling", "Kernel", "Materials", "Numerical models", "Solid modeling", "Stress", "boundary element", "fast multipole", "fiber-reinforced composites", "mechanical properties", ""], "arnumber": "6071795"}
