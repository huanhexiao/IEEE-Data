The nonlinear dynamic equation for the corrugated plate was derived by employing Galerkin's technique. The critical conditions for occurrence of the homoclinic and subharmonic bifurcations as well as chaos were studied theoretically using the Melnikov function method. The chaotic motion was also simulated numerically using Maple, with the Poincar\u00e9 map and phase curve used to evaluate when chaotic motion appears. The results indicate some chaotic motion in the corrugated plate. The method is directly applicable to chaotic analysis of an isotropic circular plate.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "572", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "576", "date_publication": "Oct. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "572 - 576"}, "authors": ["Yonggang Wang", "Zhangshi Xu"], "keywords": ["Bifurcation", "Chaos", "Mathematical model", "Nonlinear dynamical systems", "Orbits", "Vibrations", "Melnikov function", "chaotic motion", "corrugated circular plate", "subharmonic bifurcation", ""], "arnumber": "6071798"}
