To get satisfactory control performance, a fuzzy adaptive proportion integration (PI) controller was used rather than a conventional PI controller for the position control. The controller tunes the PI parameters online with fuzzy logic, based on the error and the change of the error between the feedback and reference position. The superiority of the fuzzy PI controller compared to conventional controller is illustrated by simulations and experiments which confirm that the fuzzy PI controller effectively restrains overshoot of the position response. As a result, the servo system gives satisfactory steady state and dynamic performance.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "614", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "619", "date_publication": "Oct. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "614 - 619"}, "authors": ["Yingchao Zhang", "Zhengming Zhao", "Wei Guo", "Xiaoying Sun"], "keywords": ["DC motors", "Fuzzy logic", "Permanent magnet motors", "Pi control", "Position control", "Reluctance motors", "fuzzy logic", "overshoot regulation", "position control", "synchronous reluctance permanent magnetic (SR-PM) motors", ""], "arnumber": "6071804"}
