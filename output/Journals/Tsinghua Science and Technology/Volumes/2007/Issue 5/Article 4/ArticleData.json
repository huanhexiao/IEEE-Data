An appropriate elastic-plastic constitutive relation is used to describe the material behavior and failure in each element, with a two-parameter Weibull distribution used to produce the initial heterogeneous material property variations. An adaptive incremental load-step is applied so that only one or a few elements (or integration points) change their status (i.e., from elastic to plastic, or from plastic to strain failure) within one load step. A failed element is then assigned a very small modulus to simulate the failure rather than removing it from the model, which keeps the continuity of the geometric mesh. The numerical results show that the model is suitable for simulating the effective mechanical properties and failure of heterogeneous materials with local elasto-plastic constitutive relations.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "527", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "532", "date_publication": "Oct. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "527 - 532"}, "authors": ["Yongqiang Chen", "Shuli Sun", "Yi Liu"], "keywords": ["Finite element methods", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Plastics", "Strain", "Stress", "elasto-plastic constitutive relationship", "heterogeneous material", "numerical simulation", "statistical method", ""], "arnumber": "6071791"}
