The look-up table design is very important for the error-correction implementation. This paper presents a CRC look-up table optimization method for single-bit error correction. The optimization method minimizes the address length of the pre-designed look-up table while satisfying certain restrictions. The circuit implementation is also presented to show the feasibility of the method in the application specific integrated circuit design. An application of the optimization method in the generic framing procedure protocol is implemented using field programmable gate arrays. The result shows that the memory address length has been minimized, while keeping a very simple circuit implementation.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "620", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "623", "date_publication": "Oct. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "620 - 623"}, "authors": ["Yun Pan", "Ning Ge", "Zaiwang Dong"], "keywords": ["Error correction", "Field programmable gate arrays", "Optimization methods", "Polynomials", "Protocols", "Table lookup", "cyclic redundancy code", "generic framing", "look-up table", "optimization", "procedure", "single-bit error correction", ""], "arnumber": "6071805"}
