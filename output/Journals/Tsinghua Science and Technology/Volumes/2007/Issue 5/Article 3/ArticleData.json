Two models are analyzed with one being the interface between two half spaces of fluid and solid and the other being a fluid region sandwiched by half space domains of anisotropic elastic solids. Both monopole and dipole point sources are used to generate an initial pressure wave in the fluid. Some snapshots of the transient wave behavior near the fluid-solid interfaces are given. The effect of the anisotropy in the solid on the pressure waveforms in the fluid is discussed. The numerical results allow detailed arrival identification and interpretation of acoustic and elastic waves propagating along the fluid-solid interfaces.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "520", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "526", "date_publication": "Oct. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "520 - 526"}, "authors": ["S.
