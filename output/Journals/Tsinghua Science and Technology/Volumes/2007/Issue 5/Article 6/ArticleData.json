Based on the analytical solution, a numerical method for identifying cavities in the foundation is developed. The position and size of the cavities are identified by minimizing an objective function, which is formulated according to the difference between the computed and measured natural frequencies of the system. The conjugate gradient algorithm is adopted for minimizing the objective function. Some numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the presented cavity determination method. The results show that the presented method can be used to identify the cavity position and size conveniently and efficiently.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "540", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "545", "date_publication": "Oct. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "540 - 545"}, "authors": ["Honghai Ge", "Jinyu Xu"], "keywords": ["Boundary conditions", "Cavity resonators", "Equations", "Frequency measurement", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Shape", "beam on an elastic foundation", "cavity identification", "natural frequency", "conjugate gradient algorithm", "pavement-subgrade system", ""], "arnumber": "6071793"}
