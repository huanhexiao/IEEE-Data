Both the computational complexity and memory requirement are reduced to O(N), where N is the number of degrees of freedom. The effective elastic moduli of a 2-D solid containing thousands of randomly distributed microcracks were evaluated using the FM-BEM. The results prove that both the differential method and the method proposed by Feng and Yu provide satisfactory estimates to such problems. The effect of a non-uniform distribution of microcracks has been studied using a novel model. The numerical results show that the non-uniform distribution induces a small increase in the global stiffness.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "562", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "566", "date_publication": "Oct. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "562 - 566"}, "authors": ["Pengbo Wang", "Zhenhan Yao", "Yintao Wei"], "keywords": ["Boundary element methods", "Computational modeling", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Solid modeling", "Solids", "boundary element", "effective modulus", "fast multipole", "microcrack", ""], "arnumber": "6071796"}
