The molar volume of benzene was calculated using experimental data for the thermal expansivity for constant temperatures of 25\u00b0C, 28.5\u00b0C, 40\u00b0C, and 51\u00b0C at various pressures for both the solid and liquid phases. The predictions are in good agreement with the observed volumes in both the solid and liquid phases of benzene. The predicted values of the molar volume for a constant temperature of 28.5\u00b0C in the liquid phase of benzene agree well with experimental data in the literature.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "624", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "628", "date_publication": "Oct. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "624 - 628"}, "authors": ["H.
