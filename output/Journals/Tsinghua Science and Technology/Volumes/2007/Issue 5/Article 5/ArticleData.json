The analysis shows that the feedback gain and actuator stroke cannot be selected independently and the active isolation system design must make a compromise between the feedback gain and actuator stroke. The performance of active isolation systems can be improved by the joint vibration reduction using an active vibration isolation system with an adaptive dynamic vibration absorber. The results show that the joint vibration reduction method can successfully avoid the compromise between the feedback gain and actuator stroke. The control force and the object vibration amplitude are also greatly reduced.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "533", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "539", "date_publication": "Oct. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "533 - 539"}, "authors": ["Hongling Sun", "Kun Zhang", "Haibo Chen", "Peiqiang Zhang"], "keywords": ["Actuators", "Damping", "Force", "Joints", "Shock absorbers", "Springs", "Vibrations", "actuator stroke", "dynamic vibration absorber", "passive-active", "vibration isolation", ""], "arnumber": "6071792"}
