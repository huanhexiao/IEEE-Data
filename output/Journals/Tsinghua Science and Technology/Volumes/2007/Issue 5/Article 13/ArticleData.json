This paper presents a memory and time efficient string matching algorithm specifically designed for NIMS on commodity processors. Modifications of the Aho-Corasick (AC) algorithm based on the distribution characteristics of NIMS patterns drastically reduce the memory usage without sacrificing speed in software implementations. In tests on the Snort pattern set and traces that represent typical NIMS workloads, the Snort performance was enhanced 1.480/0\u2013200/0 compared to other well-known alternatives with an automaton size reduction of 4.86\u20136.11 compared to the standard AC implementation. The results show that special characteristics of the NIMS can be used into a very effective method to optimize the algorithm design.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "585", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "593", "date_publication": "Oct. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "585 - 593"}, "authors": ["Jianming Yu", "Yibo Xue", "Jun Li"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Automata", "Data structures", "Doped fiber amplifiers", "Heuristic algorithms", "Memory management", "Pattern matching", "Aho-Corasick (AC) algorithm", "network intrusion management system (NIMS)", "string matching", ""], "arnumber": "6071800"}
