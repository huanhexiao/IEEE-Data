A flexible macro manipulator possesses the advantages of wide operating range, high speed, and low energy consumption, but the disadvantage of a low tracking precision. The macro-micro manipulator system improves tracking performance by compensating for the endpoint tracking error while maintaining the advantages of the flexible macro manipulator. A trajectory planning scheme was built utilizing the task space division method. The division point is chosen to optimize the error compensation and energy consumption for the whole system. Then movements of the macro-micro manipulator can be determined using separate inverse kinematic models. Simulation results for a planar 4-DOF macro-micro manipulator system are presented to show the effectiveness of the control system.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "607", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "613", "date_publication": "Oct. 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "607 - 613"}, "authors": ["Lingzhi Luo", "Yu Zhang", "Zengqi Sun"], "keywords": ["Joints", "Manipulator dynamics", "Planning", "Tracking", "Trajectory", "Vectors", "flexible manipulator", "macro-micro manipulator", "task space division", "trajectory planning", "trajectory tracking control", ""], "arnumber": "6071803"}
