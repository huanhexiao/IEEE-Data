In this paper, a novel design of architecture called automated testing system (ATS) is proposed. Based on techniques relating to J2EE including MVC design pattern, Struts framework, etc, ATS can support any black-box testing business theoretically with relevant APls programmed using Tcl script language beforehand. Moreover, as the core of ATS is built in Java, it can work in different environments without being recomplied. The efficiency of the new system is validated by plenty of applications in communication industry and the results also show the effectiveness and flexibility of the approach.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "51", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "56", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "51 - 56"}, "authors": ["Songwen Pei", "Baifeng Wu", "Kun Zhu", "Qiang Yu"], "keywords": ["Automation", "Browsers", "Databases", "Java", "Servers", "Software", "Testing", "J2EE", "Tcl", "automated testing system (ATS)", ""], "arnumber": "6074024"}
