In order to test the pseudorandom performance of the extended chaotic sequence, we also analyze random performance, autocorrelation performance, and balance performance of the extended chaotic sequence. Simulation results show that the extended chaotic sequence generated using our method is pseudorandom and its correlation performance and balance performance are good. As an application, we apply the extended chaotic sequence in image encryption algorithm, the simulation results show that the performance of the encrypted image using our method is better than that using logistic chaotic sequence.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "156", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "161", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "156 - 161"}, "authors": ["Xuefeng Zhang", "Jiulun Fan"], "keywords": ["Chaotic communication", "Correlation", "Encryption", "Logistics", "Performance analysis", "B&#x00E9", "zier curve", "Bernstein function", "balance performance", "correlation performance", "image encryption", "logistic system", ""], "arnumber": "6074043"}
