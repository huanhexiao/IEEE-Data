Most existing scheduling algorithms use fixed-number job replications to provide fault tolerant ability and high scheduling success rate, which consume excessive resources or can not provide sufficient fault tolerant functions when grid security conditions change. In this paper a fuzzy-logic-based selfadaptive replication scheduling (FSARS) algorithm is proposed to handle the fuzziness or uncertainties of job replication number which is highly related to trust factors behind grid sites and user jobs. Remote sensing-based soil moisture extraction (RSBSME) workload experiments in real grid environment are performed to evaluate the proposed approach and the results show that high scheduling success rate of up to 950/0 and less grid resource utilization can be achieved through FSARS. Extensive experiments show that FSARS scales well when user jobs and grid sites increase.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "45", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "50", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "45 - 50"}, "authors": ["Cheng Wang", "Congfeng Jiang", "Xiaohu Liu"], "keywords": ["Fault tolerance", "Fault tolerant systems", "Scheduling", "Scheduling algorithm", "Security", "Uncertainty", "fault tolerance", "fuzzy logic", "grid security", "job scheduling", "self-adaptive replication", ""], "arnumber": "6074023"}
