Through the simulation on the changes of the average path length and network fragmentation of the Barabasi-Albert model when faults happen, it can be observed that generic scale-free networks are quite robust to random failures, but are very vulnerable to targeted attacks at the same time. Therefore, an existing optimization strategy for the robustness of scale-free networks to failures and attacks is also introduced. The simulation similar with the above proved that the so-called (1, 0) network has potentially interconnectedness closer to that of a scale-free network and robustness to targeted attacks closer to that of an exponential network. Furthermore, its resistance to random failures is better than that of either of them.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "246", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "249", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "246 - 249"}, "authors": ["Jingbo Hao", "Jianping Yin", "Boyun Zhang"], "keywords": ["Barium", "Erbium", "Fault tolerance", "Fault tolerant systems", "Optimization", "Peer to peer computing", "Robustness", "optimization strategy", "random failure", "scale-free network", "targeted attack", ""], "arnumber": "6074059"}
