The method utilizes the Hilbert transform to extend the real signal of PLLs output into an analytic signal, and the implementation of Hilbert transform is based on the Fourier transform windowed with Hamming window. Then, the jitter of clock is extracted from the instantaneous phase of analytic signal. The experimental results of simulations validate that the proposed method can effectively extract the jitter on PLL clock, and it has better performance by comparing the sinusoidal jitter extraction results with the other methods.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "101", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "104", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "101 - 104"}, "authors": ["Yanqing Zhu", "Yigang He", "Gefeng Fang", "Hui Yang", "Shaozhong Qi", "Hui Liu"], "keywords": ["Clocks", "Fourier transforms", "Phase locked loops", "Phase measurement", "Timing jitter", "Hilbert transform", "jitter", "phase-locked loops (PLLs)", "window function", ""], "arnumber": "6074033"}
