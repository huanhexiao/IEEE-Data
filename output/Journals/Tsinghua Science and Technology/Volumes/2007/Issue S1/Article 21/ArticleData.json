It is designed as a double 2-out-of-2 architecture based on component redundant technique. Also, a quantitative probabilistic model is presented for evaluating the reliability, availability, maintainability and safety (RAMS) of this architecture. Hierarchical modeling method and Markov modeling method are used in RAMS analysis to evaluate the system characteristics. The double 2-out-of-2 system is compared with the other two systems, all voting triple modular redundancy (AVTMR) system and dual-duplex system. According to the result, the double 2-out-of-2 system has the highest dependability. Especially, the system can satisfy the safety integrity level (SIL) 4, which means the system's probability of catastrophic failure less than or equal to 10\u20138 per hour, therefore, it can be applied to life critical systems such as high-speed railway systems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "116", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "121", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "116 - 121"}, "authors": ["Shuai Wang", "Yindong Ji", "Wei Dong", "Shiyuan Yang"], "keywords": ["Availability", "Computational modeling", "Markov processes", "Mathematical model", "Random access memory", "Safety", "availability maintainability reliability safety (RAMS)", "double 2-out-of-2 system", "hierarchical modeling method", "safety integrity level (SIL)", ""], "arnumber": "6074036"}
