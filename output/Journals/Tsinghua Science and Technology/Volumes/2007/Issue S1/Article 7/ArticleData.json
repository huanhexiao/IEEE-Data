TSHOVER is two-dimensional code, which employs horizontal code and vertical code at the same time with simple exclusive-OR (XOR) computations. This paper shows the new step ascending concepts used in encoding, and it has the capability of realizing fault tolerance. TSHOVER has better data recovery ability to those disk network storage systems with relatively more dynamic changes in the number of disks. Compared with RS and STAR code, TSHOVER has better encoding performance. When updating a data strip, only 6 XOR operations are needed. Both experimental results and theoretical analyses show that TSHOVER has better performance and higher efficiency than other algorithms.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "39", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "44", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "39 - 44"}, "authors": ["Baoyu Na", "Yusen Zhang", "Lili Liu", "Peng Liu"], "keywords": ["Arrays", "Encoding", "Equations", "Fault tolerance", "Fault tolerant systems", "Strips", "DRAID", "MDS codes", "fault tolerance", "redundant array of independent disk (RAID)", ""], "arnumber": "6074022"}
