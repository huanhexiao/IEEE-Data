The relation and computing of mismatch and sensitivity are discussed also, and then a measure method of switched current mismatch using wavelet decomposition is proposed. A selected group of same transconductance is choosing as a cohort firstly, and the sensitivities of cohort in relation to the variation of transconductance are computed. Compared with the nominal deviation and tolerance borderline, the optimization and testing can be performed. As an example, a sixth order chebyshev low-pass filter is simulated and tested. The results have justified the reliability and feasibility of the method.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "229", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "234", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "229 - 234"}, "authors": ["Jierong Guo", "Yigang He", "Meirong Liu", "Shengxue Tang", "Hongmin Li"], "keywords": ["Mirrors", "Sensitivity", "Switching circuits", "Testing", "Transconductance", "Transistors", "Wavelet transforms", "cohort parameter", "decomposition", "mismatch", "sensitivity", "switched-current", "wavelet", ""], "arnumber": "6074056"}
