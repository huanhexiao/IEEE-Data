At present, the technology of code insertion and optimization is widely used in the world to detect and fix this kind of fault. Although this method can examine some of the faults in OOB programs, it cannot test programs thoroughly, neither to find the faults correctly. The way of code insertion makes the test procedures so inefficient that the test becomes costly and time-consuming. This paper, uses a kind of special static test technology to realize the fault detection in OOB programs. We first establish the fault models in OOB program, and then develop an automatic test tool to detect the faults. Some experiments have exercised and the results show that the method proposed in the paper is efficient and feasible in practical applications.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "19", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "14 - 19"}, "authors": ["Chuanping Gao", "Miyi Duan", "Liqun Tan", "Yunzhan Gong"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Arrays", "Automatic testing", "Indexes", "Libraries", "Software", "integer interval set", "out of bounds array access", "software testing", "static analysis", "syntax tree", ""], "arnumber": "6074018"}
