However, CSTP cannot reliably attain high fault coverage because of difficulty of testing random-pattern-resistant faults. This paper presents a deterministic CSTP (DCSTP) structure that consists of a DCSTP chain and jumping logic, to attain high fault coverage with low area overhead. Experimental results on ISCAS'89 benchmarks show that 100% fault coverage can be obtained with low area overhead and CPU time, especially for large circuits.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "20", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "20 - 25"}, "authors": ["Ke Wen", "Yu Hu", "Xiaowei Li"], "keywords": ["Built-in self-test", "Circuit faults", "Clocks", "Computer architecture", "Decoding", "Logic gates", "Radiation detectors", "built-in-self-test (BIST)", "circular self test path", "deterministic", "very large scale integration (VLSI) test", ""], "arnumber": "6074019"}
