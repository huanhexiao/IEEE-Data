With the advent of SOC designs, testing and verification of the core-based designs become a challenging problem. This paper presents an algebraic test generation algorithm with unspecified variable assignments. Given a stuck at fault of the circuit with unspecified signals, the proposed algorithm uses a new encoding scheme for unspecified variable assignments, and solves the Boolean satisfiability formula representing the Boolean difference to obtain a test pattern. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed algorithm.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "180", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "185", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "180 - 185"}, "authors": ["Guanghui Li", "Dongqin Feng"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Automatic test pattern generation", "Circuit faults", "Encoding", "Integrated circuit modeling", "Logic gates", "boolean satisfiability", "formal verification", "test generation", "unspecified assignments", ""], "arnumber": "6074047"}
