A new heuristic algorithm is proposed based on meanvalue approximation and implement fast re-optimization as a subsequence of an earlier best-fit-decrease (BFO) method. The mean length of each scan chain was introduced as an approximation target to balance different scan chains and hence saved testing time. Experimental results present both for assumed arbitrary cores and cores from ITC'02 benchmark and show the effectiveness of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm can provide more balanced wrapper design efficiently for the test scheduling stage.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "61", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "66", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "61 - 66"}, "authors": ["Daoheng Niu", "Hong Wang", "Shiyuan Yang", "Benmao Cheng", "Yang Jin"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Approximation algorithms", "Benchmark testing", "Heuristic algorithms", "Partitioning algorithms", "System-on-a-chip", "balance", "re-optimization", "scan chain", "system-an-chip", "wrapper", ""], "arnumber": "6074026"}
