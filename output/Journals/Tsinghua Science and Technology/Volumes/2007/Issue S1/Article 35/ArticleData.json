The traditional USB developing is only to develop USB peripheral devices. For the USB2.0 peripheral devices IP core system that has wide application foreground, some interference inevitably exists in signal transmitting. Some fault-tolerant design and test methods must be adopted in order to correctly transmit and receive data. Combining with a project, this paper introduces in detail about measures, hardware implement, and test methods of fault-tolerant design about USB2.0 peripheral devices IP core system. Fault-tolerant design measures, noise reduction measures of signal processing, fault-tolerant methods about data encode and decode, package identification (ID) field fault-tolerant methods, and cyclic redundancy checks fault-tolerant methods are discussed. The paper also presents some hardware implement methods about fault-tolerant design of data decode and test methods about fault-tolerant design of USB2.0 IP core system. These methods can offer the reference for development of USB2.0 system in all kinds of electronics instrumentations.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "197", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "201", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "197 - 201"}, "authors": ["Xiaoping Bai", "Yuanfeng Wei"], "keywords": ["Decoding", "Encoding", "Fault tolerance", "Fault tolerant systems", "Hardware", "Synchronization", "Universal Serial Bus", "fault-tolerant diagnosis", "hardware", "signal processing", "testing", "universal serial bus", ""], "arnumber": "6074050"}
