Hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) can provide more reliability to high-speed wireless data transmission. A new path weight complementary convolutional (PWCC) code used in the type-II BICM-HARQ system is proposed. The PWCC code is composed of the original code and the complimentary code. The path in trellis with large hamming weight of the complimentary code is designed to compensate for the path in trellis with small hamming weight of the original code. Hence, both of the original code and the complimentary code can achieve the performance of the good code criterion of corresponding code rate. The throughput efficiency of the BICM-HARQ system wit PWCC code is higher than repeat code system, a little higher than puncture code system in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values and much higher than puncture code system, the same as repeat code system in high SNR values. These results are confirmed by the simulation.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "240", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "245", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "240 - 245"}, "authors": ["Yuxin Cheng", "Lei Zhang", "Na Yi", "Haige Xiang"], "keywords": ["Automatic repeat request", "Convolutional codes", "Error analysis", "Fading", "Hamming weight", "Modulation", "Throughput", "bit interleaved coded modulation", "path weight complementary convolutional code", "throughput efficiency", "type-II hybrid automatic repeat request", ""], "arnumber": "6074058"}
