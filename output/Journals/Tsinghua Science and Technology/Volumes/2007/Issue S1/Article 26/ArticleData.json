An NoG-based mapping algorithm is shown in this paper. It can map irregular intellectual properties (IPs) cores onto regular tile 2-D mesh NoC architectures. The basic idea is to decompose a large IP into several dummy IPs or integrate several small IPs into one dummy IP, such that each dummy IP can fit into a single tile. It can also allocate buffer space according to the input/output degree and avoid connection congestion by adapting communication density. Experimental data indicate that using the algorithm proposed in this paper, the communication energy can be reduced about 7%.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "146", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "149", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "146 - 149"}, "authors": ["Guangshun Li", "Junhua Wu", "Guangsheng Ma"], "keywords": ["Computer architecture", "Design methodology", "Educational institutions", "IP networks", "System-on-a-chip", "communication density", "communication matrix", "network on chip (NoC)", "router weight", ""], "arnumber": "6074041"}
