In order to improve the circuit testability, this paper proposes a weighted compatibility graph (WCG), which provides a weighted formula of compatibility graph based on register allocation for testability and uses improved weighted compatibility clique partition algorithm to deal with this WCG. As a result, four rules for testability are considered simultaneously in the course of register allocation so that the objective of improving the design of testability is acquired. Tested by many experimental results of benchmarks and compared with many other models, the register allocation algorithm proposed in this paper has greatly improved the circuit testability with little overhead on the final circuit area.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "57", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "60", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "57 - 60"}, "authors": ["Qiang Sun", "Tao Zhou", "Haijun Li"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Automatic test pattern generation", "Benchmark testing", "Partitioning algorithms", "Registers", "Resource management", "USA Councils", "clique partition algorithm", "compatibility graph", "high-level synthesis", "register allocation", "testability", ""], "arnumber": "6074025"}
