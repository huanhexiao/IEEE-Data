We propose a novel scheme which cannot only detect but also correct errors occurred in FSM states. The error state will be corrected and sent back to the FSM, so that the concurrent error in the current state is detected and corrected immediately. Moreover, we realize the I P core of the self-checking module by SMIC 0.25-\u03bcm CMOS technology and also simulate its function in FPGA.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "73", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "77", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "73 - 77"}, "authors": ["Ming Li", "Shiyi Xu", "Fayu Wan", "Jianwei Gu", "Mingming Peng", "Jinsai Jiang"], "keywords": ["Circuit faults", "Convolutional codes", "Decoding", "Fault tolerance", "Fault tolerant systems", "Transient analysis", "Very large scale integration", "convolutional codes", "error-detection", "finite state machines (FSMs)", "self-checking", ""], "arnumber": "6074028"}
