This paper presents an efficient testability-improved data path scheduling scheme based on mobility scheduling, in which the scheduling begins from the operation with least mobility. In our data path scheduling scheme, the lifetimes of the I/D variables are made as short as possible to enlarge the possibility of the intermediate variables being allocated to the I/D registers. In this way, the controllability/observability of the intermediate variables can be improved. Combined with a weighted graph-based register allocation method, this scheme can obtain better testability. Experimental results on some benchmarks and example circuits show that the proposed scheme can get higher fault coverage compared with other scheduling schemes at little area overhead and even less time delay.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "134", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "138", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "134 - 138"}, "authors": ["Benmao Cheng", "Hong Wang", "Shiyuan Yang", "Daoheng Niu", "Yang Jin"], "keywords": ["Circuit faults", "Registers", "Resource management", "Scheduling", "Scheduling algorithm", "USA Councils", "high-level synthesis(HLS)", "mobility", "scheduling", "testability", ""], "arnumber": "6074039"}
