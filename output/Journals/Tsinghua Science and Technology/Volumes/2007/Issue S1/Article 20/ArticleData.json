This paper proposes a novel checkpoint protocol to effectively reduce the coordinating overhead. By using a communication vector, only a few processes participate in the checkpointing event. During checkpointing, the scheme can save the time used to trace the dependency tree by sending checkpoint requests to dependent processes at once. In addition, processes are non-blocking in this scheme, since the inconsistency is resolved by the piggyback technique. Hence the unnecessary and orphan messages can be avoided. Compared with the traditional coordinated checkpoint approach, the proposed non-blocking algorithm obtains a minimal number of processes to take checkpoints. It also reduces the checkpoint latency, which brings less overhead to mobile host with limited resources.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "110", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "115", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "110 - 115"}, "authors": ["Chaoguang Men", "Liujuan Cao", "Liwen Wang", "Zhenpeng Xu"], "keywords": ["Chaotic communication", "Checkpointing", "Educational institutions", "Mobile communication", "Mobile computing", "Protocols", "Vectors", "coordinated checkpoint", "fault tolerant", "mobile computing", "rollback recovery", ""], "arnumber": "6074035"}
