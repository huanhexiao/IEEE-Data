In order to deal with the case of large inter- and intra-die variations, we induce a novel theory prototype of the statistical leakage power analysis (SLPA) for function blocks. Because inter-die variations can be pinned down into a small range but the number of gates in function blocks is large(>1000), we continue to simplify the prototype. At last, we induce the efficient methodology of SLPA. The method can save much running time for SLPA in the low power design since it is of the local-updating advantage. A large number of experimental data show that the method only takes feasible running time (0.32 s) to obtain accurate results (3 \u03c3-error <0.5% on maximum) as function block circuits simultaneous suffer from 7.5%(3\u03c3/mean)inter-die and 7.5% intra-die length variations, which demonstrates that our method is suitable for statistical leakage power analysis of VLSIs under rampant process variations.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "67", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "72", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "67 - 72"}, "authors": ["Zuying Luo"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Computational modeling", "Integrated circuit modeling", "Logic gates", "Mathematical model", "Optimization", "Transistors", "leakage power", "process variations", "statistical analysis", "very large scale integration (VLSI)", ""], "arnumber": "6074027"}
