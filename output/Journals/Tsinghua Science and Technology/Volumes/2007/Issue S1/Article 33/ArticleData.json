In this paper, we discuss a fault-tolerant mechanism under Linux circumstance to improve the fault-tolerant ability of the system, namely a scheme and frame to form the stable computing platform. In terms of the structure and function of the distributed system, active list and file invocation strategies are employed in the task management. System multilevel fault-tolerance can be achieved by repeated processes in a single node and task migration on multi-nodes. Manager node agent introduced in this paper administrates the nodes using the list, disposes of the tasks according to the nodes' performance, and hence, to be able to make full use of the cluster resources. An evaluation method is proposed to appraise the performance. The analyzed results show the usefulness of the scheme proposed except for some additional overhead of memory consumption.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "186", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "191", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "186 - 191"}, "authors": ["Yizi Shang", "Yang Jin", "Baosheng Wu"], "keywords": ["Checkpointing", "Fault tolerance", "Fault tolerant systems", "Kernel", "Linux", "Mirrors", "Servers", "active list", "distributed system", "file invocation", "multilevel fault-tolerance", ""], "arnumber": "6074048"}
