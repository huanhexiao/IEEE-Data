Distances are calculated on directed acyclic graph (AIG). Multiplier and multiplicand are distinguished on multiplications with different coding methods, with which the operand ordering/grouping information could be extracted from a given implementation gate netlist, helping the RTL synthesis engine generate a gate netlist with great similarity. This technique has been implemented in an internal equivalence checking tool, ZD_ VIS. Compared with the simple equivalence checking, the speed is accelerated by at least 400/0 in its application to a class of arithmetic designs, addition and multiplication trees. The method can be easily incorporated into existing RTL-to-gate equivalence checking frameworks, increasing the robustness of equivalence checking for arithmetic circuits.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "235", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "239", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "235 - 239"}, "authors": ["Yanling Weng", "Haitong Ge", "Xiaolang Yan", "Ren Kun"], "keywords": ["Adders", "Design automation", "Encoding", "Engines", "IEEE Computer Society", "Input variables", "Logic gates", "arithmetic circuit", "equivalence checking", "synthesis", ""], "arnumber": "6074057"}
