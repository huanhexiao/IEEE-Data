However, it brings more challenges to the aspect of reliability. Integrated circuits become more susceptible to soft errors. Therefore, it is imperative to study the reliability of circuits under the soft error. This paper implements three probabilistic methods (two pass, error propagation probability, and probabilistic transfer matrix) for estimating gate-level circuit reliability on PC. The functions and performance of these methods are compared by experiments using ISCAS85 and 74-series circuits.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "32", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "38", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "32 - 38"}, "authors": ["Zhen Wang", "Jianhui Jiang", "Guang Yang"], "keywords": ["Estimation", "Integrated circuit modeling", "Integrated circuit reliability", "Logic gates", "Probabilistic logic", "Probability", "failure probability", "reliability estimation", "signal reliability", "soft error", "soft error rate", ""], "arnumber": "6074021"}
