Chip many-core processors are emerging to take advantage of these greater transistor densities to deliver greater performance. Effective fault tolerance techniques are essential to improve the yield of such complex chips. In this paper, a core-level redundancy scheme called N+Mis proposed to improve N-coreprocessors' yield by providing M spare cores. In such architecture, topology is an important factor because it greatly affects the processors' performance. The concept of logical topology and a topology reconfiguration problem are introduced, which is able to transparently provide target topology with lowest performance degradation as the presence of faulty cores on-chip. A row rippling and column stealing (RRCS) algorithm is also proposed. Results show that PRCS can give solutions with average 13.80/0 degradation with negligible computing time.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "169", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "174", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "169 - 174"}, "authors": ["Lei Zhang", "Yinhe Han", "Huawei Li", "Xiaowe Li"], "keywords": ["Arrays", "Network topology", "Program processors", "Redundancy", "Resource management", "System-on-a-chip", "Topology", "chip many-core processors", "fault tolerance", "network-on-chip", "reconfiguration", "yield", ""], "arnumber": "6074045"}
