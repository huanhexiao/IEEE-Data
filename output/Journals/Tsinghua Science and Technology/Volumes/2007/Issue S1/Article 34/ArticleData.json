This would consume the limited energy and bandwidth of WSNs. Furthermore, the base station may make inappropriate decisions when it receives the incorrect data sent by the faulty sensors. To solve these problems, this paper develops an online distributed algorithm to detect such faults by exploring the weighted majority vote scheme. Considering the spatial correlations in WSNs, a faulty sensor can diagnose itself through utilizing the spatial and time information provided by its neighbor sensors. Simulation results show that even when as many as 30% of the sensors are faulty, over 95% of faults can be correctly detected with our algorithm. These results indicate that the proposed algorithm has excellent performance in detecting fault of sensor measurements in WSNs.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "192", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "196", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "192 - 196"}, "authors": ["Jianliang Gao", "Yongjun Xu", "Xiaowei Li"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Circuit faults", "Fault detection", "Fault tolerance", "Fault tolerant systems", "Weight measurement", "Wireless sensor networks", "fault detection", "fault diagnosis", "fault tolerance", "spatial correlation", "wireless sensor networks", ""], "arnumber": "6074049"}
