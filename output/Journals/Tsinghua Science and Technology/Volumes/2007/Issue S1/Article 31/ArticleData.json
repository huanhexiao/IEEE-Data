A formal analysis method of survivable network was proposed based on stochastic process algebra, which incorporates formal modeling into performance analysis perfectly, and then various performance parameters of survivable network can be simultaneously obtained after formal modeling. The formal description with process expression to the survivable network system was carried out based on the simply introduced syntax and operational semantics of stochastic process algebra. Then PEPA workbench tool was used to obtain the probability of system's steady state availability and transient state availability. Simulation experiments show the effectiveness and feasibility of the developed method.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "175", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "179", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "175 - 179"}, "authors": ["Guosheng Zhao", "Huiqiang Wang", "Jian Wang"], "keywords": ["Algebra", "Analytical models", "Availability", "Computational modeling", "Servers", "Stochastic processes", "Unified modeling language", "formal analysis", "network survivability", "performance analysis", "stochastic process algebra", ""], "arnumber": "6074046"}
