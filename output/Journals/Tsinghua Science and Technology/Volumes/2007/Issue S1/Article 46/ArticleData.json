A fair and reasonable rostering method plays a very important role in the arousing worker's enthusiasm and improving the work efficiency. This paper presents a method of building models for automatic crew rostering mode with computer and advancing the multi-objective optimum scheme. The method to build models for crew rostering system is also discussed. The question to crew rostering system model is solved by genetic algorithms and simulated annealing algorithms. Simulation results show the correctness of algorithms. The actual data of the airways have justified its reasonability and efficiency.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "255", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "259", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "255 - 259"}, "authors": ["Yinghui Zhang", "Yunbo Rao", "Mingtian Zhou"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Atmospheric modeling", "Genetic algorithms", "Genetics", "Optimization", "Schedules", "Software", "crew rostering system", "crew rostering system model", "genetic algorithms", "multi-objective combinatorial optimization", "service system", "simulated annealing algorithms", ""], "arnumber": "6074061"}
