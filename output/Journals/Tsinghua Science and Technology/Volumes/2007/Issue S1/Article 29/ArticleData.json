In this paper, distributed multi-layered structure is applied to the computer cluster system, and the MPI-2 is adopted as a mature parallel programming standard. An agent is introduced which makes it possible to be multi-level fault-tolerant in software development. The communication protocol based on checkpointing and rollback recovery mechanism can realize the transaction reprocessing. Compared with conventional platform, the new system is able to make better use of the computing resource. Experimental results show the speedup ratio of the platform is almost 4 times as that of the conventional one, which demonstrates the high efficiency and good performance of the new approach.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "162", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "168", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "162 - 168"}, "authors": ["Yizi Shang", "Baosheng Wu", "Tiejian Li", "Shenguang Fang"], "keywords": ["Checkpointing", "Computational modeling", "Databases", "Fault tolerance", "Fault tolerant systems", "Rivers", "Servers", "MPI-2", "computer cluster", "digital watershed model", "fault-tolerant", ""], "arnumber": "6074044"}
