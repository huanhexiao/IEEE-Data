The output voltage and supply current of the circuit were monitored when using the oscillation test technique. The frequency, average value, maximum value and amplitude of both output voltage and supply current were taken as test parameters. Tolerance bands of test parameters were analyzed. Fault detectabilities of test parameters were compared and combined, and optimal parameter sets were derived. Experimental results show that both the output voltage and supply current give significant contribution to fault detection. Considering catastrophic, single and double parametric faults, the fault coverage in testing the benchmark circuit can be raised from 90.60% for traditional voltageonly oscillation test strategy to 97.2% by monitoring both output voltage and current parameters.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "78", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "82", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "78 - 82"}, "authors": ["Geng Hu", "Hong Wang", "Mei Hu", "Shiyuan Yang"], "keywords": ["Active filters", "Electrical fault detection", "Fault detection", "Monitoring", "Oscillators", "Testing", "analog filters", "oscillation test", "supply current", "voltage", ""], "arnumber": "6074029"}
