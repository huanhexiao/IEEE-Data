Reliability should be redefined as a function of software complexity, test effectiveness, and operating environment. This paper focuses on software complexity with its relation to the software reliability. Today, many software complexity measurements have been proposed, but most of them treat the reliability model incompletely. This paper proposes a new method which considers a relatively complete view of software reliability including its complexity and test effectiveness of the software being tested.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "266", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "269", "date_publication": "July 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "July 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "266 - 269"}, "authors": ["Yanming Chu", "Shiyi Xu"], "keywords": ["Complexity theory", "Hardware", "Software", "Software measurement", "Software reliability", "failure rate", "software complexity", "software reliability", "test effectiveness", ""], "arnumber": "6074063"}
