The focus of this paper is the behavior of pedestrians and the influence of pedestrians' behavior on the vehicle flow, pedestrian flows, and the vehicle waiting time. The proportion of pedestrians who do not obey traffic laws, the group effect, and expected waiting time of pedestrians, regarded as the most important pedestrian characteristics, are taken into consideration in the analysis. Simulation results show the ability of the microsimulation to capture the most important features of mixed traffic flow.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "214", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "222", "date_publication": "April 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "214 - 222"}, "authors": ["Yi Zhang", "Houli Duan", "Yi Zhang"], "keywords": ["Adaptation models", "Analytical models", "Automata", "Bidirectional control", "Roads", "Turning", "Vehicles", "cellular automata", "micro-simulation", "mixed traffic flow", ""], "arnumber": "6076202"}
