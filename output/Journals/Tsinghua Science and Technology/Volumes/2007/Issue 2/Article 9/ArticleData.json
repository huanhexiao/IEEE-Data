This paper uses the logit model and data to analyze the factors influencing railway access choices in a railway choice access model. The results indicate that access time, access cost, and access distance are factors significantly affecting railway access choices. The user's income significantly affects the probability of choosing to walk rather than to take a taxi, but is not related to choosing buses or bicycles. Vehicle ownership significantly affects the probability of choosing a taxi, but is not significantly related to the other modes. The conclusions provide an analysis tool for urban railway planning and construction.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "192", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "197", "date_publication": "April 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "192 - 197"}, "authors": ["Hongzhi Guan", "Yuanfei Yin", "Hai Yan", "Yan Han", "Huanmei Qin"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Bicycles", "Data models", "Legged locomotion", "Probability", "Rail transportation", "logit model", "railway access model", "urban railway", ""], "arnumber": "6076199"}
