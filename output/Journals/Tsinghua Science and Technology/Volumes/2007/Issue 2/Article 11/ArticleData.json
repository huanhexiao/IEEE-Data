The practical significance of the network parameters was then analyzed. The public transport networks in Langfang, Jining, and Dalian were then chosen as specific research cases. The results show that the public transportation networks have the characteristics of complex networks. In addition, the urban transportation network parameters all significantly affect the accessibility, convenience, and terrorist security capability of the urban public transportation network. The results link the findings with the actual situations to explore means to solve transportation system problems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "204", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "213", "date_publication": "April 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "204 - 213"}, "authors": ["Huapu Lu", "Ye Shi"], "keywords": ["Barium", "Cities and towns", "Complex networks", "Complexity theory", "Joining processes", "Marine vehicles", "Transportation", "complex networks", "degree distribution", "public transportation networks", "small world effect", ""], "arnumber": "6076201"}
