The signal control of a single intersection was then modeled as a discrete-time optimal control problem, with consideration of the constraints of stream conflicts, saturation flow rate, minimum green time, and maximum green time. The problem cannot be solved directly due to the nonlinear constraints. However, the results of qualitative analysis were used to develop a first-phase signal control algorithm. Simulation results show that the algorithm substantially reduces the total delay compared to fixed-time control.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "231", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "235", "date_publication": "April 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "231 - 235"}, "authors": ["Jinyuan Li", "Xin Pan", "Xiqin Wang"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Delay", "Equations", "Mathematical model", "Real time systems", "Vehicles", "first-phase algorithm", "optimal control", "signal control", "state-space equations", ""], "arnumber": "6076204"}
