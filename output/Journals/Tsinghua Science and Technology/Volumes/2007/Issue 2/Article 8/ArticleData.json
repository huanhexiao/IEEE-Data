The efficiency of the method is governed by the algorithmic performance of the uncapacitated model. A skew gradient-based Newton method is used to solve the capacitated user equilibrium within the feasible region of path flows. In the path-flow region, the straight gradient is defined as the derivative of the objective function with respect to the flow of the corresponding path, while the skew gradient is defined for each particular origin destination pair and is characterized by the average cost of all the paths for that pair. Instead of movement of flow toward the shortest path, in the equilibration procedure path flows below the average decrease and path flows above the average increase. The characteristics of the Newton method with the column generation procedure are combined to achieve the efficient determination of the equilibrium point. Numerical experiments demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method and highlight its potential applications.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "184", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "191", "date_publication": "April 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "184 - 191"}, "authors": ["Lin Cheng", "Wei Wang", "Zhijian Zhu", "Chunqing Yu"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Approximation methods", "Equations", "Mathematical model", "Newton method", "Roads", "Vectors", "Newton method", "side constraint", "skew gradient", "traffic assignment", ""], "arnumber": "6076198"}
