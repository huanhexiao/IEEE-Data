The aim of this work is to examine the effects on these two objectives of a recent pricing policy implemented in Japan's expressway networks. Recently the Nippon (Japan) Expressway Companies (NEXCO, operators of Japan's nation wide expressway network) have implemented several toll discount policies for users equipped with electronic toll collectors (ETCs). One of the policies is the commuter discount policy that discounts 50% for a journey on the NEXCO expressway no longer than 100 km during the commuting peak hours. This paper examines its effect on congestion reduction in the road network of Nagoya area and its influence on the use of expressways operated by another major local public expressway company in Nagoya. The congestion easing effect of this policy is compared with a potential marginal cost pricing scheme. These observations suggest that policy coordination regarding toll levels is needed for expressway corporations and transportation authorities for improving transportation efficiency of utilization of the whole network.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "151", "volume": "12", "lastpage": "157", "date_publication": "April 2007", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2007", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "151 - 157"}, "authors": ["Jiangqian Ying", "Ryosuke Ando"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Computational modeling", "Pricing", "Roads", "Urban areas", "Vehicles", "discount", "electronic toll collector (ETC)", "expressway toll", "marginal cost pricing", "revenue", "user equilibrium", ""], "arnumber": "6076194"}
