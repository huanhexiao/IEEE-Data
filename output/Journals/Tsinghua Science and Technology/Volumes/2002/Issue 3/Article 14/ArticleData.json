Nineteen species and twenty chemical reactions are considered. The chemical kinetics package (CHEMKIN) subroutines are employed to calculate species thermodynamic properties and chemical reaction rate constants. The flow field is calculated by simultaneously solving a continuity equation, an axial momentum equation and an energy equation in a cylindrical coordinate system. Thermal diffusion and Brownian diffusion are considered in the radial direction while they are neglected in the axial direction. The results suggest that the main flame is buoyancy-controlled.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "286", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "290", "date_publication": "June 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "286 - 290"}, "authors": ["Suyuan Yu", "L\u00fc Xuefeng"], "keywords": ["Chemicals", "Equations", "Fires", "Fuels", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Numerical simulation", "buoyancy", "hydrogen/air flame", "laminar diffusion flame", "numerical simulation", ""], "arnumber": "6077320"}
