Digital particle imaging velocimetry (DPIV) is used to measure velocities in the turbulent wake behind a sine shaped island for different characteristic coefficients S. Flow streamlines are given for the wake flows. The measured results show that the characteristic coefficient S is uniquely related to the flow pattern around a sine shaped island in a shallow water layer. An S value of approximately 0.20 is the critical value for transition from a vortex street to unsteady flow and a value of approximately 0. 40 is the critical value for transition from unsteady flow to steady flow.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "251", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "253", "date_publication": "June 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "251 - 253"}, "authors": ["Ling Li", "Yuliang Li", "Jiafan Chen"], "keywords": ["Atmospheric measurements", "Friction", "Imaging", "Shape measurement", "Stability analysis", "System-on-a-chip", "Water", "digital particle imaging", "flow around sine shaped island", "shallow water layer", "turbulent wake", "velocimetry (DPIV)", ""], "arnumber": "6077313"}
