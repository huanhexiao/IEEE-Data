One aspect that improves precision is the limitation, if not elimination, of manipulator compliance. This paper presents a manipulator compliance optimization approach for determining an optimal manipulator configuration for a given position in the robot's task space. A numerical solution for minimal compliance, a nonlinear constrained optimization problem, is presented for an arbitrary position and illustrated by an example, using a model developed on ADAMS software and using MATLAB optimization tools. Also, this paper investigates the optimal value function for robot tasks in which the tool-point is subjected to applied force as it generates an important trajectory such as in grinding processes. The optimal value function is needed for optimal configuration control.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "281", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "285", "date_publication": "June 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "281 - 285"}, "authors": ["H.
