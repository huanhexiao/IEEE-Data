The influence of construction plans and improved materials on the stresses in the Taxi River dam is also given. Earlier impoundment of water is shown to not only benefit the engineering design but also improve the stresses during construction in winter. Low cement content in the concrete and artificial short joints improved the monolithic structure and the transmitted forces. The concrete plug installed in the first cooled part of the arch dam provides excellent force transmission in the arch, which increases the monolith of the earlier arch, reduces the increasing thermal stresses that occur later, and improves the deformation flexibility of the dam.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "243", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "250", "date_publication": "June 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "243 - 250"}, "authors": ["Guangting Liu", "Penghui Li", "Yu Hu", "Fude Zhang", "Shunan Xie"], "keywords": ["Concrete", "Face", "Joints", "Plugs", "Rivers", "Tensile stress", "artificial short joint", "concrete plug", "roller compacted concrete (RCC) arch dam", ""], "arnumber": "6077312"}
