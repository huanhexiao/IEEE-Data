In this paper, particle filtering (PF) as an optimal method is used for solving the problem of INS alignment. A sub-optimal two-step filtering algorithm is presented to improve the real-time performance of PF. The approach combines particle filtering with Kalman filtering (KF). Simulation results illustrate the superior performance of these approaches when compared with extended Kalman filtering (EKF).", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "263", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "269", "date_publication": "June 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "263 - 269"}, "authors": ["Rui Zhao", "Qitai Gu"], "keywords": ["Approximation methods", "Atmospheric measurements", "Kalman filters", "Particle measurements", "Random variables", "Uncertainty", "extended Kalman filtering (EKF)", "inertial navigation", "particle filtering (PF)", "system (INS) alignment", "two-step filtering", ""], "arnumber": "6077316"}
