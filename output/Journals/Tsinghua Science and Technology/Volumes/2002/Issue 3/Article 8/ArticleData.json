A stochastic boundary element method based on the equations is developed to solve engineering problems of gravity dams using random factors including material parameters of the dam body and the foundation, the water level in the upper reaches, the anti-slide friction coefficient of the dam base, etc. A numerical example shows that the stochastic boundary element method presented in this paper to calculate the reliability index of large construction projects such as a large concrete gravity dam has the advantages of less input data and more precise computational results.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "254", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "257", "date_publication": "June 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "254 - 257"}, "authors": ["Ming Zhang", "Qinggao Wu"], "keywords": ["Boundary element methods", "Finite element methods", "Gravity", "Indexes", "Integral equations", "Random variables", "Reliability", "gravity dam", "partial derivatives", "random variable", "reliability index", "stochastic boundary element", ""], "arnumber": "6077314"}
