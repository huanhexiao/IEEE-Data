It is assumed that the initial data f(x, v, 0) satisfies 0 \u2264 f(x, v, 0) < c\u03a6(x, v, 0) for a positive constant c and certain types of control functions \u03a6(x, v, t). Then within a given function space B(\u03a6), we prove that f(x + tv, v, t) uniformly converges to f = (x, v) in a certain norm where f = (x, v) = limf(x + tv, v, t) and different initial data determines different long time limits.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "215", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "218", "date_publication": "June 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "215 - 218"}, "authors": ["Yingkui Zhang", "Xuguang Lu"], "keywords": ["Boltzmann equation", "Educational institutions", "Force", "Gases", "Kernel", "Kinetic energy", "Boltzmann equation", "long time behavior", "quantum effects", "spatial decay solution", ""], "arnumber": "6077307"}
