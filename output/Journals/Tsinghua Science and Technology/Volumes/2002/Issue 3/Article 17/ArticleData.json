The computational load of estimation algorithms can be reduced using the hierarchical least squares identification algorithm (HLS) for large scale multivariable systems. The convergence analysis using the Martingale Convergence Theorem indicates that the parameter estimation error (PEE) given by the HLS algorithm is uniformly bounded without a persistent excitation signal and that the PEE consistently converges to zero for the persistent excitation condition. The HLS algorithm has a much lower computational load than the RLS algorithm.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "299", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "304", "date_publication": "June 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "299 - 304"}, "authors": ["Feng Ding", "Tao Ding"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Convergence", "Least squares approximation", "MIMO", "Matrix decomposition", "Parameter estimation", "Vectors", "hierarchical identification", "identification", "large scale system", "parameter estimation", ""], "arnumber": "6077323"}
