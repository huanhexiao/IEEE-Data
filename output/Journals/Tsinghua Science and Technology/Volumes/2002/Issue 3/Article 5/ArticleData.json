We start by defining characteristic functionals of the velocity field, the density field and the temperature field of a compressible field. Using the continuity equation, the Navier-Stokes equations and the equation of energy we derive a functional equation governing the motion of an ideal gas flow and a van der Waals gas flow, and then give some general methods of deriving a functional equation governing the motion of any compressible fluid flow. These functional equations can be considered as the generalization of the Hopf functional equation.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "235", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "242", "date_publication": "June 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "235 - 242"}, "authors": ["M.
