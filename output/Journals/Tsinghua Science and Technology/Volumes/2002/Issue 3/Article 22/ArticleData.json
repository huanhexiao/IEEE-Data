The partly expanded Taylor-Galerkin (TG) discretization scheme is combined with implicit stream-upwind diffusion in the finite element formulation of the basic equations with Gauss filtering. The vortex viscosity subgrid model is used in the numerical simulation. The numerical results agree well with the available experimental data, showing that the LES method can more accurately predict the size and location of large eddies in clean-rooms than the standard k-\u220a two equation model.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "326", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "330", "date_publication": "June 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "326 - 330"}, "authors": ["Hongming Fan", "Shunlong Liu", "Zhongyi He", "Xianting Li"], "keywords": ["Atmospheric modeling", "Equations", "Finite element methods", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Numerical simulation", "Predictive models", "air distribution", "clean-room", "finite element method", "flow field", "large eddy simulation", "numerical simulation", "turbulent flow", ""], "arnumber": "6077328"}
