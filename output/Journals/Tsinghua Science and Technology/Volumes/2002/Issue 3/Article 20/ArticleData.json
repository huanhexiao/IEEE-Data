However, current devices for recording digital fingerprints can only capture plain-touch fingerprints. Rolled fingerprints have much more information for recognition, so a method is needed to construct a rolled fingerprint from a series of plain-touch fingerprints. This paper presents a novel algorithm for image mosaicing for real time rolled fingerprint construction in which the images are assembled with corrections to create a smooth, non-fragmented rolled fingerprint in real time. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing it with other conventional algorithms.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "317", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "321", "date_publication": "June 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "317 - 321"}, "authors": ["Di He", "Gang Rong", "Jie Zhou"], "keywords": ["Biomedical imaging", "Educational institutions", "Fingerprint recognition", "Fingers", "Image matching", "Image reconstruction", "Real time systems", "fingerprint identification", "image mosaic", "rolled fingerprint", ""], "arnumber": "6077326"}
