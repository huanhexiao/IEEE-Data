The linear buckling, nonlinear primary buckling, and secondary bifurcation buckling behavior of arches are compared taking into account the large deformation and the effects of initial geometric imperfections or perturbations. The theoretical investigation emphasizes the nonlinear secondary bifurcation buckling behavior for a full span uniformly distributed load. The efficiency of compact method for tracing secondary buckling path is shown through several examples. Finally, a new structural design, which prevents the secondary bifurcation buckling by adding some crossed cables across the arch, is proposed to improve the limit load carrying capacity.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "322", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "325", "date_publication": "June 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "322 - 325"}, "authors": ["Jinsan Ju", "Yanlin Guo"], "keywords": ["Approximation methods", "Bifurcation", "Chemicals", "Educational institutions", "Finite element methods", "Fuel cells", "Vectors", "load-carrying capacity", "nonlinear primary buckling", "post-buckling", "pre-buckling", "secondary bifurcation buckling", ""], "arnumber": "6077327"}
