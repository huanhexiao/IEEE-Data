This paper theoretically analyzes the roughness, electrical conductivity, and temperature corrections due to the Casimir force between two parallel polysilicon plates. The theoretical results show that the combined effects of roughness, conductivity and temperature cause a maximum relative error of the Casimir force per unit area of 26.2% between parallel polysilicon plates separated by 1 p.m. Therefore, the surface roughness and finite conductivity corrections should be taken into account when calculating precise Casimir forces with separations on the order of 1 \u03bcm.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "276", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "280", "date_publication": "June 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "276 - 280"}, "authors": ["Jianning Ding", "Yonggang Meng", "Shizhu Wen"], "keywords": ["Casimir effect", "Conductivity", "Force", "Rough surfaces", "Surface roughness", "Surface topography", "Surface waves", "Casimir force", "microelectromechanical system (MEMS)", "polysilicon", ""], "arnumber": "6077318"}
