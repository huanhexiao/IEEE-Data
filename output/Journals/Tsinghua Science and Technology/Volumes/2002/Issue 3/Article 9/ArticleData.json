Closed-form solutions are developed for both the inverse and direct kinematics. The formulation of the dexterity and the definitions of the theoretical workspace and the valid workspace are used to analyze the effects of the design parameters on the dexterity and workspace. The analysis results are used to propose an approach to satisfy the platform motion requirement while realizing orientation capability, dexterity and valid workspace. A design example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of this approach.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "258", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "262", "date_publication": "June 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "258 - 262"}, "authors": ["Jinsong Wang", "Xiaoqiang Tang", "Guanghong Duan", "Wensheng Yin"], "keywords": ["Equations", "Jacobian matrices", "Kinematics", "Machine tools", "Manipulators", "Parallel machines", "Vectors", "design", "dimensional synthesis", "parallel machine tool", ""], "arnumber": "6077315"}
