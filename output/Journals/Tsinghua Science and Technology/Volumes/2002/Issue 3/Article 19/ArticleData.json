For common randomly rough surfaces without obvious two-scale characteristics, a scale-compression filter can divide the auto-correlation spectrum into two parts with different correlation lengths. The Kirchhoff approximation and the small perturbation method are used to obtain the surface field, then a bistatic scattering model, the bi-spectrum model (BSM), is used to derive an explicit expression from the surface field. Examples using the integral equation model (IEM), finite difference of the time domain (FDTD) method, and BSM show that the BSM accuracy is acceptable and its range of validity is similar to IEM. BSM can also be extended to a scattering model for dielectric randomly rough surfaces.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "309", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "316", "date_publication": "June 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "309 - 316"}, "authors": ["Ning Liu", "Zongqian Li"], "keywords": ["Low pass filters", "Mathematical model", "Rough surfaces", "Scattering", "Sea surface", "Surface roughness", "Surface waves", "bi-spectrum scattering model", "conducting randomly rough surface", "microwave remote sensing", "scattering model", "spectral domain", ""], "arnumber": "6077325"}
