Among these methods, chirped fiber grating (CFG) is a promising scheme. This paper describes a linearly chirped fiber grating with 95% reflectivity and 0. 3 nm bandwidth written using a double exposure method with a uniform phase mask. The CFG resonant wavelength is 1554. 5 nm and dispersion is 1700 ps/nm. Dispersion compensation in a 10-Gb/s optical transmission system has been demonstrated using this chirped fiber grating. The power penalty induced by the dispersion compensation after 180-km transmission is 1 dB. This is the first report describing dispersion compensation of 180 km at 10-Gb/s optical transmission now-return to zero (NRZ) system in China.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "305", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "308", "date_publication": "June 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "305 - 308"}, "authors": ["Chengcheng Sun", "Jing Cao", "Chunyun Li"], "keywords": ["Chirp", "Fiber gratings", "Optical fiber amplifiers", "Optical fiber devices", "Optical fiber dispersion", "chirped fiber grating", "dispersion compensation", "double exposure", ""], "arnumber": "6077324"}
