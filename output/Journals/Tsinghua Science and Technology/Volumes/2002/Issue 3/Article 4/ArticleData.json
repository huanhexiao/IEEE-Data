New unknowns are introduced to reduce the order of the derivatives of the unknown to two. The result is an equivalent mixed variational problem which was solved using bilinear finite elements. The primary advantage is that special finite elements are not needed on the adjacent layer of the artificial boundary for the higher-order derivatives. Error estimates are obtained for some local artificial boundary conditions with prescibed orders. A numerical example demonstrates the effectiveness of this method.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "228", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "234", "date_publication": "June 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "228 - 234"}, "authors": ["Houde Han", "Chunxiong Zheng"], "keywords": ["Approximation methods", "Boundary conditions", "Finite element methods", "Minimization", "Poisson equations", "Zirconium", "artificial boundary", "high-order artificial boundary condition", "mixed finite element method", ""], "arnumber": "6077310"}
