The mechanisms for producing acoustic signals and their propagation are analyzed to extract the features of the radiated noise from different targets. Analysis of the acoustic spectra of typical vehicle targets acquired outdoors shows that the vehicles can be classified based on the acoustic spectra and amplitudes.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "291", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "293", "date_publication": "June 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "291 - 293"}, "authors": ["Jinhui Lan", "Baohua Ma", "Kejie Li"], "keywords": ["Acoustics", "Educational institutions", "Engines", "Feature extraction", "Frequency domain analysis", "Noise", "Vehicles", "acoustic detection", "feature extraction", "signal processing", ""], "arnumber": "6077321"}
