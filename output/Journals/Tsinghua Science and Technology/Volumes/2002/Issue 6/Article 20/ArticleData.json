A novel optical scanning system for gene disease diagnostics described in this paper has four kinds of optical devices, including beam splitters, an array lens, an array filter and detection arrays. A software was developed to design the binary optics system using an iterative method. Two beam splitters were designed and fabricated, which can divide a beam into a 9 \u00d7 9 array or into a 13 \u00d7 13 array. The beam splitters have good diffraction efficiencies (>70%) and an even energy distribution. The gene disease diagnostic system is a portable biochip and binary optics technology. The binary optical devices in the non-confocal scanning system can raise the fluorescence detection sensitivity of the micro-array hybrid biochip.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "665", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "667", "date_publication": "Dec. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "665 - 667"}, "authors": ["Guoliang Huang", "Tengfei Zhang", "Jing Cheng", "Yuxiang Zhou", "Chengxun Liu", "Guofan Jin", "Minxian Wu", "Yingbai Yan", "Rong Yang"], "keywords": ["Arrays", "Diseases", "Fluorescence", "Gratings", "Lenses", "binary optics", "biochip", "gene", ""], "arnumber": "6072686"}
