This paper presents a workflow-based method to dynamically execute the enterprise model. This method gives an explicit representation of the business process logic and the relationships between the elements involved in the process. An execution-oriented integrated enterprise modeling system is proposed in combination with other enterprise views. The enterprise model can be established and executed dynamically in the actual environment due to the dynamic properties of the workflow model.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "619", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "623", "date_publication": "Dec. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "619 - 623"}, "authors": ["Shuangxi Huang", "Yushun Fan", "Haibin Luo", "Huiping Lin"], "keywords": ["Adaptation models", "Computational modeling", "Data models", "Organizations", "Personnel", "Synchronization", "business process", "enterprise modeling", "workflow", ""], "arnumber": "6072677"}
