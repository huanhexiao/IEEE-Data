Mirror-symmetric matrices defined in this paper can represent mirror-symmetric structures with various components on the mirror plane. Some basic properties of mirror-symmetric matrices were studied and applied to interconnection analysis. A generalized odd/even-mode decomposition scheme was developed based on the mirror reflection relationship for mirror-symmetric multiconductor transmission lines (MTLs). The per-unit-length (PUL) impedance matrix Z and admittance matrix Y can be divided into odd-mode and even-mode PUL matrices. Thus the order of the MTL system is reduced from n to k and k + p, where p (\u2265 0) is the conductor number on the mirror plane. The analysis of mirror-symmetric matrices is related to the theory of symmetric group, which is the most effective tool for the study of symmetry.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "602", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "607", "date_publication": "Dec. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "602 - 607"}, "authors": ["Guolin Li", "Zhenghe Feng"], "keywords": ["Capacitance", "Conductors", "Matrix decomposition", "Mirrors", "Symmetric matrices", "Transmission line matrix methods", "Vectors", "mirror-symmetric matrix", "mirror-symmetric multiconductor transmission line (MTL)", "odd/even-mode decomposition", ""], "arnumber": "6072675"}
