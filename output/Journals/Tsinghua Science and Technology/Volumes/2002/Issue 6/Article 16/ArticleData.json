PCC 6803", "abstract": "The transient effects of NaCl on chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells were examined. In dark-adapted cells, salt shock induced a transition from state 2 to state 1, and the artificial quinones, phenyl, 4-benzoquinone (PBQ) and 2, 5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-1, 4-benzoquinone (DBMIB), quenched the Chl fluorescence markedly after addition of 0.8 mol/L NaCl. In light-adapted cells, the addition of NaCl caused a significant increase in the stationary fluorescence yield, which resulted in a decrease in the quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII). The results indicate that salt shock can induce a change in the affinity between the photosystems and the phycobilisomes (PBS) and can perturb the orientation of the Chl molecules in PSII.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "645", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "648", "date_publication": "Dec. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "645 - 648"}, "authors": ["Haibin Mao", "Xiang Ruan", "Guofu Li", "Yandao Gong", "Xiufang Zhang", "Nanming Zhang"], "keywords": ["Biomembranes", "Electric shock", "Fluorescence", "Frequency modulation", "Ions", "Stress", "Suspensions", "chlorophyll fluorescence", "cyanobacteria", "salt shock", "state transition", ""], "arnumber": "6072682"}
