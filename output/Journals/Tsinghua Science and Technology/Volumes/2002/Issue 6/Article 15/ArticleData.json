A potent melanoma inhibitor, purified from the seeds of C. minax and termed Caesalpinia minax protein (CMP), is a protein with a relative molecular mass of 19.8 \u00d7 10\u2022 Experiments were conducted to assay the inhibitive effects of CMP on the proliferation, migration, and adhesion of murine melanoma cell line K1735M2. The results showed that cell proliferation was suppressed by about 60 % with treatment of 22\u03bcg/mL CMP. Furthermore, the migration of K1735M2 cells was inhibited by 30% in the presence of 22\u03bcg/mL CMP. The results also demonstrated that the inhibitive effect of CMP on the migration was dose-dependent. Although low-doses of CMP had no obvious inhibitive effect on the adhesion of K1735M2, 22 \u03bcg/mL CMP inhibited the adhesion of K1735M2 by 50%. These results suggest that CMP might be a potential medicine for melanoma therapy.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "641", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "644", "date_publication": "Dec. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "641 - 644"}, "authors": ["Xuya Yu", "Liping Xie", "Yong Zhang", "Honzhong Wang", "Chonghua Li", "Chaoyin Chen", "Rongqing Zhang"], "keywords": ["Adhesives", "In vitro", "Malignant tumors", "Metastasis", "Proteins", "USA Councils", "Caesalpinia minax", "cell adhesion", "cell migration", "melanoma", "metastasis", ""], "arnumber": "6072681"}
