This paper describes the limitations of the reachability analysis method in analyzing complex systems for existing TCPNs. Based on further research on the schedulability analysis method with various topology structures, a more general state reachability analysis method is proposed. To meet various requirements of timely response for actual systems, this paper puts forward a heuristic method for selecting decision-spans of transitions and develops a heuristic algorithm for schedulability analysis of TCPNs. Examples are given showing the practicality of the method in the schedulability analysis for real-time systems with various structures.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "596", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "601", "date_publication": "Dec. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "596 - 601"}, "authors": ["Huifang Li", "Yushun Fan"], "keywords": ["Fires", "Firing", "Petri nets", "Reachability analysis", "Real time systems", "Time factors", "Timing", "Petri nets", "decision-span", "schedulability analysis", "timing constraint", ""], "arnumber": "6072674"}
