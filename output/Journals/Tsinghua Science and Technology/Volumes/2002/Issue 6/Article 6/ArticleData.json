Analysis of the movement and distribution of nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) in subsurface domain is critical for contaminant remediation. Two-dimensional experiments were conducted in a transparent plexiglass trough (105.0 cm \u00d7 70.0 cm \u00d7 1. 5 cm) to simulate the release and redistribution of gasoline and kerosene in porous media. The results show that before the contaminant distribution reaches equilibrium, the movement of light NAPLs (LNAPLs) can be divided into four sub-staqes, After the contaminant front reaches the upper boundary of the capillary fringe, contaminant movement along the upper boundary of the capillary fringe is the primary transport process. Most of the contaminants then move into the capillary fringe except for the residual part. One-dimensional and two-dimensional capillary tube models were developed to analyze the movement of LNAPLs in the capillary fringe.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "584", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "590", "date_publication": "Dec. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "584 - 590"}, "authors": ["Xiaofeng Wu", "Jie Tang", "L\u00fc Xianbi"], "keywords": ["Atmospheric modeling", "Electron tubes", "Lenses", "Media", "Petroleum", "Shape", "Silicon compounds", "capillary-tube", "light nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL)", "multiphase flow", "nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL)", ""], "arnumber": "6072672"}
