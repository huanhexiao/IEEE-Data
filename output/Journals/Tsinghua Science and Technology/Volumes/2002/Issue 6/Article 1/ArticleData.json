This paper presents a drawing recognition method for automatic dimensioning of shear-walls. The regional relationship method includes a graphic shape template library that can learn new shear-wall shapes. The automatic dimensioning of shear-walls is then realized by matching the templates. The regional relationship method for graph recognition effectively describes the topological relationships for graphs to significantly increase the recognition efficiency.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "555", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "559", "date_publication": "Dec. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "555 - 559"}, "authors": ["Aizhu Ren", "Qiang Yu", "Yun Xu"], "keywords": ["Arrays", "Computers", "Libraries", "Pattern recognition", "Shape", "Topology", "computer-aided design", "dimensioning", "drawing recognition", "shear-wall", ""], "arnumber": "6072667"}
