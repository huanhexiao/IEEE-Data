The mAb 17\u20131A has been used for immunotherapy of colorectal cancer. We obtained mAb 19F4 using a synthetic peptide containing antigen determinants of 17\u2013lA antigen. The mAb 19F4 can bind the corresponding dominants of the 17\u20131A antigen in ELISA. Western-blot analysis demonstrated that mAb 19F4 recognized a 50-kD protein from cell Iysates of MCF-7 (breast cancer cell line). Both mAb 19F4 and 17\u20131A detected a 42-kD protein in the cell Iysates of HT-29 (colorectal cancer cell line). The results suggest that new members of the tumor-associated antigen family 17\u20131A may exist.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "649", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "651", "date_publication": "Dec. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "649 - 651"}, "authors": ["Li Qin", "Yinghua Chen"], "keywords": ["Cancer", "Humans", "Immune system", "Mice", "Peptides", "Proteins", "Vaccines", "17&#x2013", "1A antigen", "epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Ep-CAM)", "monoclonal antibody", "peptide", ""], "arnumber": "6072683"}
