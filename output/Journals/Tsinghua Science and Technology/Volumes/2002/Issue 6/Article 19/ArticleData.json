Currently, different methods are used for ceramide analysis, some of which are insensitive or cumbersome. This paper described methods utilizing thin layer chromatography (TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) followed by evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD) to detect ceramide directly in cell extracts without derivatization, which was proved to be efficient and reproducible. Five kinds of ceramides were used as standards. Both TLC and normal-phase HPLC /ELSD results indicate that yeast contains several kinds of ceramides.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "660", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "664", "date_publication": "Dec. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "660 - 664"}, "authors": ["Lin Zhang", "Quan Zhou", "Xueqi Fu", "Guoqiang Chen"], "keywords": ["Biochemistry", "Carbon", "Educational institutions", "Light scattering", "Lipidomics", "Standards", "Strain", "ceramide", "ergosterol", "evaporative light scattering detection (ELSD)", "high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)", "sphingolipid", "thin layer chromatography (TLC)", ""], "arnumber": "6072685"}
