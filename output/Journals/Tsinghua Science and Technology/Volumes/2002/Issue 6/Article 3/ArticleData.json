Free vibration analysis of beams with rectangular cross-section for various combinations of end conditions is studied. The results show that the differential quadrature method is reliable and accurate compared with other available results.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "567", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "573", "date_publication": "Dec. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "567 - 573"}, "authors": ["Lijuan Feng", "Hongzhi Zhong", "Zhaoping Hao", "Delong Wu"], "keywords": ["Boundary conditions", "Composite materials", "Differential equations", "Equations", "Lamination", "Strain", "Vibrations", "differential quadrature method", "free vibration", "laminated composite beam", ""], "arnumber": "6072669"}
