The method characterizes the sentence meaning as a linear sequence of dependency relationships which are the semantic or syntactic relationships between words in the sentence. This representation method is used to build a Chinese statistical parser model to understand the sentence meaning. Specific experiments on automatic telephone switchboard conversations show that the proposed parser has a precision of 80%. This work provides a foundation for building a large-scale Chinese semantic corpus and for research on understanding modeling of the Chinese language.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "591", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "595", "date_publication": "Dec. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "591 - 595"}, "authors": ["Juanzi Li", "Zuoying Wang"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Grammar", "Merging", "Probability", "Semantics", "Syntactics", "Tagging", "dependency grammar", "natural language understanding", "statistical parser", ""], "arnumber": "6072673"}
