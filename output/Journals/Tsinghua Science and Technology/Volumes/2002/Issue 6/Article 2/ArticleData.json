The analysis results show that this kind of composite wall panel works very well, and can be regarded as a solid panel. The composite wall panel with a hidden frame is essential for bringing its effect on shear resistance into full play. Comprehensive analysis of the shear-resistant behavior of the composite wall panel suggests that the shear of the composite shear wall panel can be controlled by the cracking strength of the web shearing diagonal crack.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "560", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "566", "date_publication": "Dec. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "560 - 566"}, "authors": ["Shengcai Li", "Jianjing Jiang", "Qingrong Yu"], "keywords": ["Bars", "Concrete", "Force", "Shearing", "Steel", "Stress", "Wires", "composite shear wall", "cracking strength", "hidden frame", "shear design", "shear test", "shearing diagonal crack", ""], "arnumber": "6072668"}
