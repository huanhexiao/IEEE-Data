Transcription factors (TFs) play an important role in controlling the temporal special specificity of gene expression. The regulation area of actin genes was analyzed statistically to predict the transcription factor binding sites in the regulatory area. A group of transcription factors located in most of the sequences is believed to play an important role in co-regulating the expression of actin genes.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "652", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "659", "date_publication": "Dec. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "652 - 659"}, "authors": ["Jiashun Zheng", "Jiashun Wu", "Zhirong Sun"], "keywords": ["Animals", "Bioinformatics", "Embryo", "Gene expression", "Random sequences", "Statistical analysis", "actin", "computational analysis", "transcription factor", "transcriptional regulation", ""], "arnumber": "6072684"}
