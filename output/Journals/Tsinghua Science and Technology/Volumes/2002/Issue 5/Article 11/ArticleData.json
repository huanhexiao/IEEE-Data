In this paper, the wavelet transform was used to analyze different AE signals from cracks (surface and inner), pencil-lead-breakage and leakage. These acoustic sources were applied on an actual pressure vessel. While the vessel experienced hydraulic pressure, their AE signals were acquired by a digital AE testing system with a wide frequency band transducer and a high speed A/D converter. Then, the digital signals were analyzed using the wavelet transform method. Correlation coefficients of the transformed data show that the different acoustic sources can be easily identified.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "488", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "491", "date_publication": "Oct. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "488 - 491"}, "authors": ["Luming Li", "Peng Zheng", "Shifeng Liu", "Keren Shi"], "keywords": ["Acoustic emission", "Bioinformatics", "Correlation", "Wavelet analysis", "Wavelet transforms", "acoustic emission", "acoustic source", "correlation coefficient", "pressure vessel", "wavelet analysis", ""], "arnumber": "6079147"}
