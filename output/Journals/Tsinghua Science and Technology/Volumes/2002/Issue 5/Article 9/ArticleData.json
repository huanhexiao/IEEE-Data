The Navier-Stokes equations were solved on a moving grid system using a time-dependent coordinate transformation. Several numerical schemes were tested to investigate the vortex-shedding characteristics and the effects of Reynolds number and other dimensionless parameters such as the reduced amplitude and the reduced frequency. The numerical results indicate that several types of vortex shedding modes depend on the reduced frequency and the reduced amplitude due to synchronization or lock-on.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "475", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "480", "date_publication": "Oct. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "475 - 480"}, "authors": ["Song Liu", "Song Fu"], "keywords": ["Acceleration", "Force", "Mathematical model", "Numerical simulation", "Oscillators", "Time frequency analysis", "Vibrations", "circular cylinder", "in-line oscillating", "reduced frequency", "vortex shedding", ""], "arnumber": "6079145"}
