In the proposed method, the fuzzy logic controller can make adjustments to signal timing in response to observed changes. The \u201curgency degree\u201d term that can describe different user's demands for a green light is used in the fuzzy logic decision-making. In addition, a three-level fuzzy controller model decides whether to extend or terminate the current signal phase and the sequence of phases. Simulation results show that the fuzzy controller can adjust its signal timing in response to changing traffic conditions on a real-time basis and that the proposed fuzzy logic controller leads to less vehicle delays and a lower percentage of stopped vehicles.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "502", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "507", "date_publication": "Oct. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "502 - 507"}, "authors": ["Wu Wei", "Yi Zhang", "Zuo Zhang", "Jingyan Song"], "keywords": ["Decision making", "Delay", "Detectors", "Fuzzy logic", "Green products", "Vehicles", "fuzzy logic controller", "traffic signal control", "urban intersection", "urgency degree", ""], "arnumber": "6079150"}
