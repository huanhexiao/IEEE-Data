Design and operating experience for the demonstration plant was gained through pilot tests of advanced treatment technologies with soil infiltration of well treated secondary effluent. The test results showed that the selected treatment technology meets the recommended water quality criteria for groundwater recharge and the gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC/MS) analysis results showed significantly improved water quality.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "539", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "543", "date_publication": "Oct. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "539 - 543"}, "authors": ["Xuzhou Cheng", "Lei Yang", "Tianbao Wu", "Yiping Gan", "Jun Hu"], "keywords": ["Biology", "Effluents", "Filtration", "Laboratories", "Soil", "Wastewater", "Water pollution", "adsorption", "groundwater recharge", "soil infiltration", "wastewater effluent", ""], "arnumber": "6079157"}
