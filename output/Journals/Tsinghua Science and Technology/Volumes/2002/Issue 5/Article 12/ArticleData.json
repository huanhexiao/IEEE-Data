The dynamic equations were solved numerically using the Runge-Kutta method to calculate the vibration amplitudes of the flexible beams and the attitude angular velocity. The results show that the vibration amplitudes increase as the beam length increases or as the initial attitude angular velocity increases. The results also show that the vibration amplitudes decrease as the deployment velocity increases.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "492", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "495", "date_publication": "Oct. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "492 - 495"}, "authors": ["Xuduo Cheng", "Junfeng Li", "Yong Fan", "Zhaolin Wang"], "keywords": ["Angular velocity", "Dynamics", "Equations", "Interference", "Mathematical model", "Space vehicles", "Vibrations", "attitude dynamics", "flexible beam", "spacecraft", ""], "arnumber": "6079148"}
