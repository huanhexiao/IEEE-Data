Many speech recognition algorithms have been developed to solve this problem by filtering the input signal with a single-zero high pass filter. Unfortunately, this technique increases the noise energy at high frequencies above 4 kHz, which in some cases degrades the recognition accuracy. This paper solves the problem using a pre-emphasis filter in the front end of the recognizer. The aim is to develop a modified parameterization approach taking into account the whole energy zone in the spectrum to improve the performance of the existing baseline recognition system in the acoustic phase. The results show that a large vocabulary speaker-independent continuous speech recognition system using this approach has a greatly improved recognition rate.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "521", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "526", "date_publication": "Oct. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "521 - 526"}, "authors": ["Fadhil H.
