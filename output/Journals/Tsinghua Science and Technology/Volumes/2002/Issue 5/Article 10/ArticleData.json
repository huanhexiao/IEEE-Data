Detailed manufacturing information is conveyed to the designer through micro-circles within the concurrent design process for machined parts, focusing on instantaneous product design and process planning. The process has three key elements: a hierarchical architecture design of the concurrent process planning system, modeling and reengineering of the concurrent process planning, and modeling of information. The approach is successfully implemented and applied for concurrent design and process planning of some complicated parts.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "481", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "487", "date_publication": "Oct. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "481 - 487"}, "authors": ["Dan Wu", "Xiankui Wang", "Zhizhong Li"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Fixtures", "Machining", "Manufacturing", "Process planning", "Product development", "Solid modeling", "concurrent design", "concurrent engineering", "process planning", ""], "arnumber": "6079146"}
