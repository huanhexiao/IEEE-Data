This paper presents a new image watermarking method based on integer-to-integer wavelet transforms. The watermark is embedded in the significant wavelet coefficients by a simple exclusive OR operation. The method avoids complicated computations and high computer memory requirements that are the main drawbacks of common frequency domain based watermarking algorithms. Simulation results show that the embedded watermark is perceptually invisible and robust to various operations, such as low quality joint picture expert group (JPEG) compression, random and Gaussian noises, and smoothing (mean filtering).", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "508", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "512", "date_publication": "Oct. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "508 - 512"}, "authors": ["Tao Chen", "Jingchun Wang"], "keywords": ["PSNR", "Robustness", "Simulation", "Watermarking", "Wavelet transforms", "data hiding", "digital watermark", "integer-to-integer wavelet transform", "steganography", ""], "arnumber": "6079151"}
