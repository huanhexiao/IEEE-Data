The Monte Carlo method was used to simulate the potential energy, intermolecular forces, radial distribution function, density profile, surface thickness and surface tension for a TY fluid at different temperatures. The results for a TY fluid are compared to those for a Lennard-Jone fluid, which shows that the surface properties are more sensitive to the intermolecular potential than the bulk properties and the repulsive action with a shore range can also influence the surface properties.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "458", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "462", "date_publication": "Oct. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "458 - 462"}, "authors": ["Jinchen Liu", "Wei Wu", "Jiufang Lu", "Yigui Li"], "keywords": ["Fluids", "Force", "Mathematical model", "Monte Carlo methods", "Resource description framework", "Surface tension", "Temperature", "Monte Carlo", "computer simulation", "surface property", "two-Yukawa fluid", ""], "arnumber": "6079141"}
