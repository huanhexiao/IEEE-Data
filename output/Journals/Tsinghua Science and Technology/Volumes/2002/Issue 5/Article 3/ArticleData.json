In this paper, the effects of culture conditions, including culture temperatures, light levels, the carbon source and its concentration, and the preserve of regulators (mainly hormones), are studied for callus cultures. All the experiments used Murashige and Skoog (MS) solid medium as the basic medium with 10g/L agar, pH 5.7\u20135.8. Saffron callus was cultured at 20\u00b0C in the dark, with a sucrose concentration of 45g/L (or starchy hydrolysate concentration of 40g/L), but 30g/L sucrose was best for the synthesis of crocin (for starchy hydrolysate the concentration can range from 20 to 40g/L). To promote callus growth, the best auxin was \u03b1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and the optimum ratio of NAA (mg/L) to benzylaminopurine (BA) (mg/L) was 2 : 0.25. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) (4 mg/L), gibberellin (GA3) (2 mg/L), and uniconazole (S-07) (1.25 mg/L) increased the crocin content remarkably as analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). NAA (2 mg/L) promoted the growth of saffron callus but had no benefit and may inhibit crocin synthesis while S-07 (1.25 mg/L) had the opposite effect. GA3 promoted both growth and synthesis.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "448", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "453", "date_publication": "Oct. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "448 - 453"}, "authors": ["Xue Liu", "Zhigang Guo", "Ruizhi Liu"], "keywords": ["Barium", "Biochemistry", "Biomass", "Carbon", "Regulators", "Sugar", "Temperature measurement", "callus", "crocin", "saffron", ""], "arnumber": "6079139"}
