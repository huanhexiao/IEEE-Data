A general tire ring model was then developed including all the nonlinear terms in the ring strain and the initial stresses induced by the internal pressure and rotation. The general equations of motion were derived from the Hamilton principle whth the geometric parameters for the model directly obtained from the tire design. The physical parameters were calculated from experimental mode parameters. A numerical example is given for a 195/70 R14-type tire. The analysis shows that the predicted natural frequencies and the tire mode shape agree well with experimental results.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "496", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "501", "date_publication": "Oct. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "496 - 501"}, "authors": ["Yintao Wei", "Chengjian Fan", "Dihua Quan"], "keywords": ["Equations", "Load modeling", "Mathematical model", "Strain", "Stress", "Tires", "Vehicle dynamics", "mode", "ring model", "tire", "variational principle", ""], "arnumber": "6079149"}
