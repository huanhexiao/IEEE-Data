Optimal channel widths are designed by estimating the power consumption of the Fibonacci-like charge pump. An optimal frequency is a compromise between the rise time and the dynamic power dissipation. The optimization of the two-phase nonoverlapping clock generator circuit improves the efficiency. Simulation results based on 1.2 \u03bcm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology parameters verify the efficiency of the design.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "517", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "520", "date_publication": "Oct. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "517 - 520"}, "authors": ["Hairong Yu", "Zhiliang Chen"], "keywords": ["Boosting", "Capacitors", "Charge pumps", "Clocks", "Power dissipation", "Switches", "Topology", "DC-DC converter", "charge pump circuit", "liquid crystal display driver", ""], "arnumber": "6079153"}
