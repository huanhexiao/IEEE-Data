The wide symmetrical dynamic range of this neuron ensures high noise immunity. The pulsed activation strategy provides a power efficient architecture, so the circuit has very low power dissipation. The simplicity of the circuit ensures its suitability for large-scale integration.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "513", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "516", "date_publication": "Oct. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "513 - 516"}, "authors": ["Jiwei Chen", "Bingxue Shi"], "keywords": ["Biological neural networks", "Computer architecture", "Dynamic range", "Mirrors", "Neurons", "Pulse width modulation", "Transistors", "complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistor", "low power design", "neuron network", "pulse width modulation (PWM)", "pulsed activation", "very large scale integration (VLSI)", ""], "arnumber": "6079152"}
