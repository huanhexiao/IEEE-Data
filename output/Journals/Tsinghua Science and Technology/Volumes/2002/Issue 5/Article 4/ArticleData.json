BP networks are often trained using the generalized delta-rule (GDR) algorithm but application of such networks is limited because of the low convergent speed of the algorithm. This paper presents a new algorithm incorporating the Marquardt algorithm into the BP algorithm for training feedforward BP neural networks. The new algorithm was tested with several case studies and used to model the Reid vapor pressure (RVP) of stabilizer gasoline. The new algorithm has faster convergence and is much more efficient than the GDR algorithm.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "454", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "457", "date_publication": "Oct. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "454 - 457"}, "authors": ["Jianyu Wu", "Xiaorong He"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Approximation algorithms", "Artificial neural networks", "Convergence", "Educational institutions", "Jacobian matrices", "Training", "Marquardt algorithm", "neural network", "training", ""], "arnumber": "6079140"}
