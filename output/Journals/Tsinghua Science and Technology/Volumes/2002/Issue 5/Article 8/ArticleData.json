The acetoacetyl group can be introduced into the side group of hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) to activate HEC using the ester exchange reaction between HEC and ethyl acetoacetate (EAA) to improve HEC grafting. This paper discusses the main factors affecting the reaction, such as the amount of EAA and catalyzer, the reaction temperature, and the reaction time. The acetoacetyl group was successfully introduced into HEC. Within specified ranges, increasing the amount of EAA, the reaction temperature and the reaction time will increase the acetoacetylation.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "471", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "474", "date_publication": "Oct. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "471 - 474"}, "authors": ["Xiaofeng Chen", "Yanfang Gao", "Yi Du", "Deshan Liu"], "keywords": ["Educational institutions", "Films", "Heating", "Polymers", "Resins", "Spectrogram", "Temperature", "acetoacetylate", "ethyl acetoacetate (EAA)", "hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC)", ""], "arnumber": "6079144"}
