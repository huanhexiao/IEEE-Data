Consequently, the thermodynamic states within a thermosyphon are distributed more heterogeneously. In a glass thermosyphon, flows and phase distributions were observed. A break-down of the heat transport mechanism was found as a consequence of flooding the cooling region with liquid. Observed and explained \u2014 by use of a density/pressure diagram \u2014 were the effects of heating, of pressure and of fluid quantity on the distribution of the phases, the appearance of pulsations and the propagation of a heat pulse near the critical state.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "109", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "115", "date_publication": "April 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "109 - 115"}, "authors": ["E.
