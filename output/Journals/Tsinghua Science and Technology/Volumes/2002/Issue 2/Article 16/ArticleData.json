The numerical simulation results are compared with experimental data. The difference between convection heat transfer in packed beds and in sintered porous media and the effects of the boundary condition assumptions are investigated. The results show that the numerical simulation of convection heat transfer of air or water in packed beds using the local thermal non-equilibrium model and the variable porosity model agrees well with the experimental data. The convection heat transfer coefficient in sintered porous media is much higher than that in packed beds. In the numerical simulation of convection heat transfer in sintered porous media, the boundary conditions on the wall should be that the particle temperatures are equal to the fluid temperature.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "202", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "208", "date_publication": "April 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "202 - 208"}, "authors": ["Peixue Jiang", "Meng Li", "Zepei Ren"], "keywords": ["Boundary conditions", "Data models", "Fluids", "Heat transfer", "Media", "Numerical models", "Solids", "boundary condition", "heat transfer", "local thermal non-equilibrium", "packed bed", "porosity", "sintered porous media", ""], "arnumber": "6077299"}
