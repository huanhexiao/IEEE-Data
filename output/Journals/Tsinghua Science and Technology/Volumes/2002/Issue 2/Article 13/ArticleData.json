A polygeneration system based on coal gasification was analyzed using the exergy method to calculate the system thermal efficiency. The results show that the polygeneration system has less pollutants and higher efficiency than the separate systems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "190", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "193", "date_publication": "April 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "190 - 193"}, "authors": ["Yuanyuan Duan", "Jin Zhang", "Lin Shi", "Mingshan Zhu", "Lizhong Han"], "keywords": ["Chemicals", "Coal", "Heating", "Methanol", "Particle separators", "Turbines", "exergy analysis", "gasification", "polygeneration", ""], "arnumber": "6077296"}
