The mass fractions of copper oxide nanoparticles in the experiment, w, varied between 0.02 and 0. 10, and the temperature range was 30\u00b0C to 80\u00b0C. The experimental results show that the temperature was the major factor affecting the viscosity of the nanoparticle suspensions, while the effect of the mass fraction on the viscosity was not so obvious as that of the temperature for the mass fractions chosen in the experiment. The effect of the capillary tube size on the viscosity was also found to be relatively important at higher mass fractions.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "198", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "201", "date_publication": "April 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "198 - 201"}, "authors": ["Junming Li", "Zeliang Li", "Buxuan Wang"], "keywords": ["Conductivity", "Heat transfer", "Nanoparticles", "Suspensions", "Temperature measurement", "Viscosity", "capillary viscometer", "nanoparticle-suspensions", "viscosity", ""], "arnumber": "6077298"}
