These analytical solutions are useful for their description of actual flow fields and as benchmark solutions to check the rapidly developing numerical calculations and to study various computational methods such as the discrete approximations of the governing equations and grid generation methods. In addition, some novel mathematical methods are used in the analyses.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "187", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "189", "date_publication": "April 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "187 - 189"}, "authors": ["Na Zhang", "Ruixian Cai"], "keywords": ["Benchmark testing", "Equations", "Fluid flow", "Mathematical model", "Media", "Water heating", "analytical solutions", "flow transfer", "permeable system", ""], "arnumber": "6077295"}
