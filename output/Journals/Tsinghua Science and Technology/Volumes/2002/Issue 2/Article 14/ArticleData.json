The design and performance simulation of the geothermal heat exchangers is vital to the success of this technology. In GSHP systems, the load of the geothermal heat exchanger varies greatly and is usually discontinuous even during a heating or cooling season. This paper outlines a heat transfer model for geothermal heat exchangers. The model was used to study the influence of the discontinuous operation of the heat pumps on the performance of the geothermal heat exchangers. A simple and practical approach is presented for sizing the geothermal heat exchangers.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "194", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "197", "date_publication": "April 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "194 - 197"}, "authors": ["Zhaohong Fang", "Nairen Diao", "Ping Cui"], "keywords": ["Approximation methods", "Cooling", "Heat pumps", "Heat transfer", "Heating", "Land surface temperature", "Load modeling", "geothermal heat exchanger", "ground-source heat pump (GSHP)", "heat conduction", ""], "arnumber": "6077297"}
