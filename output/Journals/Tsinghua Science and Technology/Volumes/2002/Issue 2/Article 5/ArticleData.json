A simple coordinate transformation is employed to transform the complex wavy-wall channel to a parallel-plate channel, and the cubic spline alternating-direction implicit method is then used to solve the flow patterns and heat transfer characteristics. The effects of the wavy geometry, vortex viscosity parameter and Reynolds number on skin-friction coefficient and Nusselt number have been examined in detail. Results show that the flow through a sinusoidally curved converging-diverging channel forms a strong forward flow and a reticular vortex within each wave for larger Reynolds number and wavy amplitudes. The heat transfer rate of a micropolar fluid is smaller than that of a Newtonian fluid, but the skin friction of a micropolar fluid is larger than that of a Newtonian fluid. Moreover, both Reynolds number and wavy amplitude tend to enhance the total heat transfer rate, irrespective of whether the fluids are Newtonian fluids or micropolar fluids.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "146", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "154", "date_publication": "April 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "146 - 154"}, "authors": ["Cha'o-Kuang Chen", "Chi-Chang Wang"], "keywords": ["Boundary conditions", "Equations", "Heat transfer", "Mathematical model", "Spline", "Viscosity", "cubic spline", "forced convection", "micropolar fluids", "wavy surface", ""], "arnumber": "6077288"}
