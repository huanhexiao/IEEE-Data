The analysis compares the condensation and convective heat transfer rates. For the concentration range investigated, the water vapor condensation transfers more energy than the flue gas convection, but the convective heat transfer can not be neglected. The heat transfer intensification due to the condensation increased as the water vapor fraction increased. The theoretical results compared well with experimental data.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "177", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "181", "date_publication": "April 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "177 - 181"}, "authors": ["Li Jia", "Xiaofeng Peng"], "keywords": ["Electron tubes", "Films", "Heat transfer", "Mathematical model", "Predictive models", "Temperature measurement", "Water heating", "condensation", "convection", "flue gas", "heat transfer", "mixture", ""], "arnumber": "6077293"}
