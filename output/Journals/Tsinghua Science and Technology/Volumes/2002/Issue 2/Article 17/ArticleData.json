Observations showed that bubbles escaping from the channels enhanced the heat transfer. Three regimes were identified: liquid flooding, bubbles in the channel and the bottom drying out region. The maximum heat transfer occurred for an optimum vapor channel density and the boiling heat transfer performance was increased if the channels were open to the bottom of the porous coating.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "209", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "212", "date_publication": "April 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "209 - 212"}, "authors": ["Wei Wu", "Jianhua Du", "Buxuan Wang"], "keywords": ["Coatings", "Copper", "Heat transfer", "Heating", "Media", "Surface treatment", "Temperature measurement", "boiling enhancement", "porous media", "vapor channels", ""], "arnumber": "6077300"}
