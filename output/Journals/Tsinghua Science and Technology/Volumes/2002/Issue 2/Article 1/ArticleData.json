The experimental data reveals that departing periods of successive bubbles evolve multiple periods from single to triple periods when the gas flow rate is increased and that the micro-convection evolves bifurcation phenomena similar to the so-called \u201cperiod doubling\u201d in chaos dynamics. The photographic observation using high-speed video movies and data analysis indicate that the nonlinear features come from the deformation of the bubble and also the interaction between consecutive bubbles. A new comprehensive theoretical model is developed for describing the instantaneous bubble behaviors during formation and ascendance processes and for predicting the departing periods and sizes of successive bubbles for constant flow rate conditions. Owing to the estimation of instantaneous interactions between successive bubbles and the incorporation of the wake effect of previous bubbles, the present model describes the evolution process and mechanisms of bubble departing periods corresponding to different gas flow rate regimes. The theoretical results are in good agreement with experimental results.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "97", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "108", "date_publication": "April 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "97 - 108"}, "authors": ["Masahiro Shoji"], "keywords": ["Bifurcation", "Films", "Fluid flow", "Fluid flow measurement", "Orifices", "Predictive models", "Probes", "Nonlinear bubbling", "aperiodic bubble formation", "bubble interaction", "micro-convection", "nonlinear model", ""], "arnumber": "6077284"}
