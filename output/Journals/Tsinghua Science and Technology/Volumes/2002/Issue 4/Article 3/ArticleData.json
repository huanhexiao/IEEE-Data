Creatine kinase (CK) is a typical model for studying unfolding and refolding of proteins due to several interesting properties. Recent studies on the folding of CK show that its partially folded monomeric intermediate is present kinetically and is stable at equilibrium. The present paper contains 33 references as a mini review to characterize the properties of CK from studies on the CK folding pathway. Characterization of these intermediates is an essential step toward understanding the mechanism of protein folding. Some well-determined schemes are suggested as protein folding models.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "347", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "351", "date_publication": "Aug. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "347 - 351"}, "authors": ["Yongdoo Park", "Haimeng Zhou"], "keywords": ["Fluorescence", "In vitro", "In vivo", "Kinetic theory", "Muscles", "Proteins", "creatine kinase", "folding pathway", "intermediate", "partially folded state", ""], "arnumber": "6077345"}
