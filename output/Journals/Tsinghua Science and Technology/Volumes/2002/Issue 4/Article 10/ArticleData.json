Efficiencies higher than 10 cfu/\u03bcg (cfu, clone forming unit) plasmid DNA were obtained for Streptococcus zooepidemicus H2004 cells. Results demonstrate that the broad-host-range plasmid pDL276 can be replicated in Streptococcus zooepidemicus H2004 and foreign genes responsible for polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthesis inserted into the pDL276 can be successfully expressed in the transformant, in which PHB is detected using the Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) method.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "387", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "392", "date_publication": "Aug. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "387 - 392"}, "authors": ["Xiaoming Wu", "Haijun Gao", "Ge Tian", "Guoqiang Chen"], "keywords": ["DNA", "Electric fields", "Media", "Microorganisms", "Protocols", "Strain", "Suspensions", "Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR)", "Streptococcus", "electroporation", "polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)", ""], "arnumber": "6077352"}
