Heat denaturation of photosystem II (PSII) membrane was studied using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (OSC) and oxygen electrode. Complete loss of oxygen-evolving activity of the PSII membrane was observed at temperatures below 45\u00b0C. The decrease of excitonic interaction between chlorophyll molecules occurred more rapidly than the change of the protein secondary structure of the PSII membrane at temperatures above 45\u00b0C. The results indicate that the protein secondary structure of the membrane proteins in PSII membranes is more stable than the excitonic interaction between chlorophyll molecules during heat denaturation.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "407", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "410", "date_publication": "Aug. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "407 - 410"}, "authors": ["Donghai Li", "Xiang Ruan", "Qiang Xu", "Kebin Wang", "Yandao Gong", "Tingyun Kuang", "Nanming Zhao"], "keywords": ["Biomembranes", "Heat treatment", "Heating", "Proteins", "Spectroscopy", "Temperature measurement", "Temperature sensors", "circular dichroism (CD)", "differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)", "excitonic interaction", "heat denaturation", "oxygen-evolving activity", "photosystem II (PSII)", ""], "arnumber": "6077356"}
