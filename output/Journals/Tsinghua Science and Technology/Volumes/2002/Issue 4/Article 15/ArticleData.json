Interestingly, recombinant protein E2 that contains only one structural antigenic unit (unit B/C or A) could protect pigs from a lethal challenge of CSFV. Based on these findings, we designed and prepared five overlapping synthetic peptides that covered the sequence unit B/C (aa 693\u2013777) of Shimen E2 and conjugated individual peptides with bovine serum albumin (BSA). After the vaccination, the specificity of the rabbit sera was analyzed in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). The results show that each of the five candidate peptide-vaccines can successfully induce a high titer of specific antibodies in New Zealand White Rabbits (n = 3). Subsequently, the five candidate peptide-vaccines were applied in combination for immunization of pigs (n = 10) and induced specific and strong humoral responses against all of the five designed peptides in pigs. Our studies indicate that the candidate multi-peptide-vaccine would prove an excellent marker vaccine against CSFV and provide a model for developing effective synthetic peptide vaccines to stop viral epidemics in humans and animals.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "411", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "415", "date_publication": "Aug. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "411 - 415"}, "authors": ["Geng Zhang", "Xiaonan Dong", "Yinghua Chen"], "keywords": ["Immune system", "Peptides", "Proteins", "Rabbits", "Strain", "Temperature measurement", "Vaccines", "antibody", "classical swine fever virus (CSFV)", "multi-peptide-vaccine", ""], "arnumber": "6077357"}
