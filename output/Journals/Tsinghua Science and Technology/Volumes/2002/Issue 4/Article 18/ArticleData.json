Unfolding and inactivation rate constants were measured and compared. The inactivation course is much faster than that of unfolding, which suggests that the active site of CIP containing two zinc ions and one magnesium ion is situated in a limited and flexible region of the enzyme molecule, which is more fragile to the denaturant than the protein as a whole.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "425", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "429", "date_publication": "Aug. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "425 - 429"}, "authors": ["Yingxia Zhang", "Shulian Yan", "Yongli Liu", "Hongwei Xi", "Haimeng Zhou"], "keywords": ["Biotechnology", "Fluorescence", "Ions", "Metals", "Proteins", "alkaline phosphatase", "guanidinium chloride", "inactivation", "unfolding", ""], "arnumber": "6077360"}
