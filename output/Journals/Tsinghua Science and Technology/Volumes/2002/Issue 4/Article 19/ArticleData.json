Based on the specific binding, this paper presented the molecular assembly of protein-nucleic acid multilayers on the surface of a gold film. The first layer was a biotin-lipid (B-DMPE/DMPE) containing a monolayer prepared using the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique. The second and third layers were avidin and DNA labeled biotin, respectively. The fourth layer was anti-DNA antibody extracted from the serum of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). These interactions provide stability in the multilayer films of the complexes. The multilayer formation process was detected by SPR spectroscopy. The results show that the chip-based sensor system can be used for functional characterization of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "430", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "434", "date_publication": "Aug. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "430 - 434"}, "authors": ["Wenzhang Xie", "Yingjie Lu", "Senfang Sui"], "keywords": ["DNA", "Films", "Gold", "Nonhomogeneous media", "Plasmons", "Proteins", "Surface treatment", "Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) film", "avidinbiotin", "molecular recognition", "surface plasmon resonance (SPR)", "systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)", ""], "arnumber": "6077361"}
