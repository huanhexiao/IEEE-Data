Most of the species and subspecies of sturgeons are threatened or endangered in at least some of their habitats. Many are nearing extinction. The threat against sturgeons will continue to grow as the world's population increases. Therefore, the problem of conserving sturgeons and replenishing their stock in the entire range has become urgent for scientists of various countries. Materials given here will be useful for solving this difficult but important problem. The problems concerning the Acipenseridae, such as the investigation of resource classification and biological conservation, are also discussed.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "416", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "420", "date_publication": "Aug. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "416 - 420"}, "authors": ["Daming Huang"], "keywords": ["Asia", "Europe", "Lakes", "Marine animals", "Oceans", "Rivers", "Acipenseriformes", "conservation biology", "distribution", "species", "sturgeon", ""], "arnumber": "6077358"}
