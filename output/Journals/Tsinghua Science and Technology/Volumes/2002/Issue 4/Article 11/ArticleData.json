A maximal poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHHx) content of 49. 13% in dry cells was obtained in a shake flask culture. PHBHHx of 6.26 g/L was produced in a fermentation experiment over 48 h on a sole carbon source containing 100 g/L soybean oil, while 12.40 g/L PHBHHx was produced on a mixed carbon source containing 80 g/L soybean and 20 g/L lauric acid over the same period of time, resulting in a polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) productivity of 0.25 g/(L \u2022 h). The results show that mixed carbon sources are suitable for industrialized production of PHBHHx from A. hydrophila 4AK4, as the mixed carbon sources also overcome the foaming problem that occurs when lauric acid is employed as a sole carbon source in PHBHHx production.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "393", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "397", "date_publication": "Aug. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "393 - 397"}, "authors": ["Jin Zhang", "Guang Zhang", "Jinchun Chen", "Xiuying Hua", "Guoqiang Chen"], "keywords": ["Carbon", "Educational institutions", "Microorganisms", "Minerals", "Strain", "Sugar", "Aeromonas hydrophila", "mixed carbon source", "poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyhexanoate) (PHBHHx)", "polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs)", ""], "arnumber": "6077353"}
