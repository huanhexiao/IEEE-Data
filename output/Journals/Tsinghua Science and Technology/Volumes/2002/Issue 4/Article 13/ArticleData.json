However, as a nerve conduit biomaterial, its solubility was very low, so chitosan was modified chemically to enhance its solubility. The free amino groups of long molecular chains in chitosan are responsible for its solubility, and the solubility could be adjusted by controlling the free amidogen capacity with N-alkylation. The results show that the solubility of N-alkylation chitosan is increased to 10%, which is an increase of 500%.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "404", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "406", "date_publication": "Aug. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "404 - 406"}, "authors": ["Jinguang Deng", "Yandao Gong", "Mingyu Cheng", "Nanming Zhao", "Xiufang Zhang"], "keywords": ["Chemicals", "Educational institutions", "Plastics", "Presses", "Production facilities", "Tissue engineering", "alkylation", "chitosan", "nerve conduit", "solubility", ""], "arnumber": "6077355"}
