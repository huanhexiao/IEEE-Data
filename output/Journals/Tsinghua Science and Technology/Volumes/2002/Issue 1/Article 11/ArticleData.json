A single CGA dispersed in water is composed of a gaseous inner core, surrounded by a double water-soapy layer. CGAs have large interfacial area per unit volume and exhibit relatively high stability. These characteristics make CGAs very suitable in flotation systems. This paper studied the flotation of organic dyes from water using CGAs. The experimental results show that the flotation process may follow four mechanisms, i. e., ion coupling of the oppositely charged species of the surfactant forming the CGA and the organic dye, reactions between CGA and the organic dye, ion-dye complex adsorbed on the surface of CGAs, and hydrophilic or hydrophobic characteristics of the organic dyes.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "46", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "51", "date_publication": "Feb. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "46 - 51"}, "authors": ["Yingyi Huang", "Yundong Wang", "Youyuan Dai"], "keywords": ["Couplings", "Electric potential", "Films", "Infrared spectra", "Ions", "Suspensions", "Colloidal gas aphrons (CGAs)", "flotation", "organic dye", "surfactant", ""], "arnumber": "6077269"}
