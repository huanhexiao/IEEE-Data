Tri-n-octylamine (TOA) and tributyl phosphate (TBP) were selected as complexing agents. 1-Octanol and kerosene were selected as diluents. The effects of extractant concentration and pH on the distribution ratio were discussed in detail. It was found that there are ion-pair association and hydrogen-bond complexing in the extraction. Expressions of the equilibrium distribution for different solvent systems are proposed. The precision of the models is satisfactoy.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "52", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "55", "date_publication": "Feb. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "52 - 55"}, "authors": ["Jin Zhang", "Youyuan Dai"], "keywords": ["Chemicals", "Educational institutions", "Industries", "Materials", "Solid modeling", "Solvents", "USA Councils", "aminobenzoic acid", "extraction based on chemical complexation", "tri-n-octylamine", "tributyl phosphate", ""], "arnumber": "6077270"}
