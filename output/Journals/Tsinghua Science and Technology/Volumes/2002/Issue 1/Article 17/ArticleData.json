The van der Waals mixing rules are used and the binary parameters are adjusted to experimental data. The SAFT-BACK equation of state provides a better correlation of vapor-liquid equilibrium than the original BACK equation. Consequently, the binary parameters computed from the data sets can be used to accurately predict the saturated densities of the vapor and liquid phases.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "73", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "77", "date_publication": "Feb. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "73 - 77"}, "authors": ["Zhiyu Zhang", "Zhongqiao Hu", "Jichu Yang", "Yigui Li"], "keywords": ["Carbon", "Carbon dioxide", "Correlation", "Equations", "Ethanol", "Fluids", "Mathematical model", "Boubl&#x00ED", "k-Alder-Chen-Kreglewshi (BACK)", "equation of state", "statistical associating fluid theory (SAFT)", "supercritical fluids", "vapor-liquid equilbrium", ""], "arnumber": "6077275"}
