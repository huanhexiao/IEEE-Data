Experiments have been carried out in a loop reactor with 100 mm inner diameter and 2. 5 m height, in which air, tap water and silica gel particles are used as the gas, liquid and solid phase, respectively. The radial profile of gas holdup, bubble size, bubble rising velocity, liquid circulating velocity, and the influence of the main operating conditions such as superficial gas velocity and solids concentration have been studied experimentally in the TPAL slurry reactor. The experimental results show that the bubble characteristics are different in various flow regimes and the radial profiles of some hydrodynamic parameters in the TPAL slurry reactor are more uniform than those in traditional three-phase reactors. The distribution of the bubble size and bubble rising velocity can be described by a lognormal function. The influence of superficial gas velocity on the hydrodynamic parameters is more remarkable than that of the solids concentration.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "Feb. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "17 - 24"}, "authors": ["Fei Ren", "Jinfu Wang", "Tiefeng Wang", "Yong Jin"], "keywords": ["Hydrodynamics", "Inductors", "Optical fibers", "Probes", "Slurries", "Solids", "Ultrasonic variables measurement", "hydrodynamics", "optic fiber probe", "three-phase airlift loop (TPAL) slurry reactor", "ultrasonic Doppler velocimeter", ""], "arnumber": "6077263"}
