A rigorous approach including a set of molecular reactions, radiation and coke formation models was used to simulate the naphtha pyrolysis in the cracking furnace. The simulation predicted the periodic operating state of the cracking furnace. The profiles of main product yields, coke layer thickness, tube skin temperature, and other operation parameters were studied with respect to time. The simulation showed that the calculated results were in good agreement with the real working plant experience.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "36", "volume": "7", "lastpage": "40", "date_publication": "Feb. 2002", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2002", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "36 - 40"}, "authors": ["Qiang Xu", "Chen Bingzhen", "Xiaorong He"], "keywords": ["Biological system modeling", "Coils", "Electron tubes", "Furnaces", "Mathematical model", "Temperature distribution", "Temperature measurement", "Cracking furnace", "ethylene", "simulation", ""], "arnumber": "6077267"}
