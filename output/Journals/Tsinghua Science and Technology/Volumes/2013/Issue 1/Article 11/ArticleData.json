A differential coherent algorithm is given here to improve the SNR and reduce the performance degradation due to the Squaring-Loss and the navigation-bit effect. The algorithm uses fast navigation-bit correction for Delay-Doppler Maps (DDM) in airborne Global Navigation Satellite Signal Reflectometry (GNSS-R) software receivers. The system model is introduced with an analysis of the statistical properties with simulations to support the theoretical analysis. Field experiments with real airborne receivers then demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm. Comparisons with test results show that this algorithm offers a significant SNR gain over conventional algorithms.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "88", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "99", "date_publication": "Feb. 2013", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "1", "pages": "88 - 99"}, "authors": ["Yiran Wang", "Bo Zhang", "Dingrong Shao"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Global Navigation Satellite Systems", "Receivers", "Satellite navigation systems", "Sea surface", "Signal to noise ratio", "Software algorithms", "Delay-Doppler maps", "Global Navigation Satellite Signal Reflectometry (GNSS-R)", "differential coherence", "satellite navigation", "signal processing", "signal-to-noise ratio", ""], "arnumber": "6449412"}
