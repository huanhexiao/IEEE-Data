This paper presents a constraint sampling feature extraction method that improves the SRC recognition rate. The method combines texture and shape features to significantly improve the recognition rate. Tests show that the combined constraint sampling and facial alignment achieves very high recognition accuracy on both the AR face database (99.52%) and the CAS-PEAL face database (99.54%).", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "62", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "67", "date_publication": "Feb. 2013", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "1", "pages": "62 - 67"}, "authors": ["Jing Wang", "Guangda Su", "Ying Xiong", "Jiansheng Chen", "Yan Shang", "Jiongxin Liu", "Xiaolong Ren"], "keywords": ["Classification", "Databases", "Face recognition", "Feature extraction", "Shape analysis", "Sparse representation", "classification", "face alignment", "face recognition", "feature extraction", ""], "arnumber": "6449409"}
