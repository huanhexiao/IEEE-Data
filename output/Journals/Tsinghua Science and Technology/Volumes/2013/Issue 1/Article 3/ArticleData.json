This paper describes a baseline GPGPU cloud system built on Kepler GPUs, for the purpose of exploring hardware potential while improving task performance. This paper elaborates a general scheme which defines the whole cloud system into a cloud layer, a server layer, and a GPGPU layer. This paper also illustrates the hardware features, task features, scheduling mechanism, and execution mechanism of each layer. Thus, this paper provides a better understanding of general-purpose computing on a GPGPU cloud.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "22", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "Feb. 2013", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "1", "pages": "22 - 23"}, "authors": ["Liang Hu", "Xilong Che", "Zhenzhen Xie"], "keywords": ["Cloud computing", "Graphics processing units", "Multiprocessor interconnection", "Servers", "Virtualization", "GK110", "GPGPU cloud", "Kepler", "SMX", "virtualization", ""], "arnumber": "6449404"}
