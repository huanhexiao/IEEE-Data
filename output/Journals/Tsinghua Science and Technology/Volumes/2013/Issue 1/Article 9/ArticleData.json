KM provides insight into the interdependencies and uncertainties contained in the system. This paper uses a model-free method to mine KMs in historical data to analyze component stock corporations of the Shanghai Stock 50 index. The analyses use static and time-domain analyses. The results indicate that a knowledge map is useful for representing knowledge and for monitoring the health of companies. Furthermore, sudden changes of the key features of the KMs should be taken seriously by policymakers as an alarm of a crisis.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "68", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "76", "date_publication": "Feb. 2013", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "1", "pages": "68 - 76"}, "authors": ["Wenhui Shou", "Wenhui Fan", "Boyuan Liu", "Yuyang Lai"], "keywords": ["Biomedical monitoring", "Data mining", "Fuzzy logic", "Knowledge management", "Knowledge represenation", "Medical services", "Knowledge Map (KM)", "crisis warning", "data mining", "health monitoring", ""], "arnumber": "6449410"}
