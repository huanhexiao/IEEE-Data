X-to-MapReduce (X is a program language) translator is a possible solution to help traditional programmers easily deploy an application to cloud systems through translating sequential codes to MapReduce codes. Recently, some SQL-to-MapReduce translators emerge to translate SQL-like queries to MapReduce codes and have good performance in cloud systems. However, SQL-to-MapReduce translators mainly focus on SQL-like queries, but not on numerical computation. Matlab is a high-level language and interactive environment for numerical computation, visualization, and programming, which is very popular in engineering. We propose and develop a simple Matlab-to-MapReduce translator for cloud computing, called M2M, for basic numerical computations. M2M can translate a Matlab code with up to 100 commands to MapReduce code in few seconds, which may cost a proficient Hadoop MapReduce programmer some days on coding so many commands. In addition, M2M can also recognize the dependency between complex commands, which is always confusing during hand coding. We implemented M2M with evaluation for Matlab commands on a cluster. Several common commands are used in our experiments. The results show that M2M is comparable in performance with hand-coded programs.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "9", "date_publication": "Feb. 2013", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "1", "pages": "1 - 9"}, "authors": ["Junbo Zhang", "Dong Xiang", "Tianrui Li", "Yi Pan"], "keywords": ["Cloud computing", "Computational modeling", "MATLAB", "Mathematical model", "Programming", "MapReduce", "Matlab", "cloud computing", "translator", ""], "arnumber": "6449402"}
