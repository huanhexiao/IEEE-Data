Good load balancing makes cloud computing more efficient and improves user satisfaction. This article introduces a better load balance model for the public cloud based on the cloud partitioning concept with a switch mechanism to choose different strategies for different situations. The algorithm applies the game theory to the load balancing strategy to improve the efficiency in the public cloud environment.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "34", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "39", "date_publication": "Feb. 2013", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "1", "pages": "34 - 39"}, "authors": ["Gaochao Xu", "Junjie Pang", "Xiaodong Fu"], "keywords": ["Cloud computing", "Computational modeling", "Game theory", "Heuristic algorithms", "Load management", "Load modeling", "Round robin", "cloud partition", "game theory", "load balancing model", "public cloud", ""], "arnumber": "6449405"}
