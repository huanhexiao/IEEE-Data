The correction term is implemented as a look-up table. The algorithm uses the correction term redundancy by means of a coordinate transformation to reduce the hardware complexity. Simulations and hardware tests indicate that the decoding performance is very good with the appropriate look-up table.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "57", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "61", "date_publication": "Feb. 2013", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "1", "pages": "57 - 61"}, "authors": ["Chen Qian", "Weilong Lei", "Zhaocheng Wang"], "keywords": ["Broadcasting", "Complexity theory", "Decoding", "Parity check codes", "Table lookup", "Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) code", "decoding", "look-up table", ""], "arnumber": "6449408"}
