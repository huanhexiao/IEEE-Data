Among the cognitive models, HMAX has been widely used in computer vision systems for its robustness shape and texture features inspired by the ventral stream of the human brain. This work presents a Color-HMAX (C-HMAX) model based on the HMAX model which imitates the color vision mechanism of the human brain that the HMAX model does not include. C-HMAX is then applied to the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) which has 43 categories and 51840 sample traffic signs with an accuracy of 98.41%, higher than most other models including linear discriminant analysis and multi-scale convolutional neural network.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "51", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "56", "date_publication": "Feb. 2013", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 07 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "1", "pages": "51 - 56"}, "authors": ["Bo Yang", "Lipu Zhou", "Zhidong Deng"], "keywords": ["Artificial neural networks", "Brain modeling", "Cognitive models", "Computational modeling", "Feature extraction", "Image color analysis", "Visualization", "artificial cognitive model", "machine learning", "traffic sign recognition", ""], "arnumber": "6449407"}
