Using community detection algorithms in biological networks, the community structure of biological networks can be determined, which is helpful in analyzing the topological structures and predicting the behaviors of biological networks. In this paper, we analyze the diseasome network using a new method called disease-gene network detecting algorithm based on principal component analysis, which can be used to investigate the connection between nodes within the same group. Experimental results on real-world networks have demonstrated that our algorithm is more efficient in detecting community structures when compared with other well-known results.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "454", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "461", "date_publication": "Oct. 2013", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 03 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "5", "pages": "454 - 461"}, "authors": ["Wei Liu", "Ling Chen"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Bioinformatics", "Communities", "Covariance matrices", "Diseases", "Genomics", "Principal component analysis", "community detection", "disease-gene network", "principal component analysis", ""], "arnumber": "6616519"}
