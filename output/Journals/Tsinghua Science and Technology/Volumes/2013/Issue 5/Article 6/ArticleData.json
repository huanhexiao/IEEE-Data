The huge volume of reads, along with short read length, high coverage, and sequencing errors, poses a great challenge to de novo genome assembly. However, the paired-end information provides a new solution to these problems. In this paper, we review and compare some current assembly tools, including Newbler, CAP3, Velvet, SOAPdenovo, AllPaths, Abyss, IDBA, PE-Assembly, and Telescoper. In general, we compare the seed extension and graph-based methods that use the overlap/lapout/consensus approach and the de Bruijn graph approach for assembly. At the end of the paper, we summarize these methods and discuss the future directions of genome assembly.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "500", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "514", "date_publication": "Oct. 2013", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 03 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "5", "pages": "500 - 514"}, "authors": ["Yiming He", "Zhen Zhang", "Xiaoqing Peng", "Fangxiang Wu", "Jianxin Wang"], "keywords": ["Bioinformatics", "Error analysis", "Genomics", "Next generation networking", "Sequential analysis", "de Bruijn graph", "genome assembly", "next-generation sequencing", "overlap/lapout/consensus", ""], "arnumber": "6616523"}
