In this paper, an integrated tool kit named Biomolecular Network Match (BNMatch) is designed and developed based on Cytoscape\u2014a popular and open-source tool for analyzing and visualizing networks. BNMatch integrates the comparison of the outputs of algorithms used for processing biomolecular networks and expresses the matching data between them by defining similar vertices and links with similar attributes. Moreover, in order to maintain consistency, their counterparts in other networks change when the nodes and edges in one of the compared networks are changed. It becomes easy for users to analyze similar networks by invoking comparison algorithms and visualizing the matching data between the networks using BNMatch.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "515-", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "521", "date_publication": "Oct. 2013", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 03 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "5", "pages": "515- - 521"}, "authors": ["Jiang Xie", "Zhonghua Zhou", "Kai Lu", "Luonan Chen", "Wu Zhang"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Biomolecular networks", "Data visualization", "Proteins", "Software development", "Visualization", "Cytoscape", "biomolecular networks comparison", "visualization", ""], "arnumber": "6616524"}
