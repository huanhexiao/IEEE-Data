Research efforts based on preferences and relationships between users have attracted more and more attention. Predictive problems, such as inferring friend relationship and co-author relationship between users have been explored. However, many such methods are based on analyzing either node features or the network structures separately, few have tried to tackle both of them at the same time. In this paper, in order to discover latent co-interests' relationship, we not only consider users' attributes but network information as well. In addition, we propose an Interest-based Factor Graph Model (I-FGM) to incorporate these factors. Experiments on two data sets (bookmarking and music network) demonstrate that this predictive method can achieve better results than the other three methods (ANN, NB, and SVM).", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "379", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "386", "date_publication": "August 2013", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "August 2013", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 05 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "4", "pages": "379 - 386"}, "authors": ["Feng Tan", "Li Li", "Zheyu Zhang", "Yunlong Guo"], "keywords": ["Artificial neural networks", "Internet", "Predictive models", "Social network services", "Support vector machines", "factor graph model", "linking prediction", "node similarity", "social network", ""], "arnumber": "6574676"}
