Compared with traditional Win+Intel alliance in PC, Android+ARM alliance dominates in Mobile Internet, the apps replace the PC client software as the major target of malicious usage. In this paper, to improve the security status of current mobile apps, we propose a methodology to evaluate mobile apps based on cloud computing platform and data mining. We also present a prototype system named MobSafe to identify the mobile app's virulence or benignancy. Compared with traditional method, such as permission pattern based method, MobSafe combines the dynamic and static analysis methods to comprehensively evaluate an Android app. In the implementation, we adopt Android Security Evaluation Framework (ASEF) and Static Android Analysis Framework (SAAF), the two representative dynamic and static analysis methods, to evaluate the Android apps and estimate the total time needed to evaluate all the apps stored in one mobile app market. Based on the real trace from a commercial mobile app market called AppChina, we can collect the statistics of the number of active Android apps, the average number apps installed in one Android device, and the expanding ratio of mobile apps. As mobile app market serves as the main line of defence against mobile malwares, our evaluation results show that it is practical to use cloud computing platform and data mining to verify all stored apps routinely to filter out malware apps from mobile app markets. As the future work, MobSafe can extensively use machine learning to conduct automotive forensic analysis of mobile apps based on the generated multifaceted data in this stage.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "418", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "427", "date_publication": "August 2013", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "August 2013", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 05 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "4", "pages": "418 - 427"}, "authors": ["Jianlin Xu", "Yifan Yu", "Zhen Chen", "Bin Cao", "Wenyu Dong", "Yu Guo", "Junwei Cao"], "keywords": ["Androids", "Cloud computing", "Humanoid robots", "Malware", "Mobile communication", "Smart phones", "Android platform", "big data", "cloud computing", "data mining", "forensic analysis", "hadoop distributed file system", "machine learning", "mobile malware detection", "redis key-value store", ""], "arnumber": "6574680"}
