This paper focuses on automatic collecting representative logo images from the Internet without any human labeling or seed images. We propose multiple dictionary invariant sparse coding to solve this problem. This work can automatically provide prototypes, representative images, or weak labeled training images for logo detection, logo recognition, trademark infringement detection, brand protection, and ad-targeting. The experiment results show that our method increases the mean average precision for 25 types of logos to 80.07% whereas the original search engine results only have 32% representative logo images. The top images collected by our method are accurate and reliable enough for practical applications in the future.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "606", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "617", "date_publication": "Dec. 2013", "inspec": "15568222", "date": "Dec. 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Dec 06 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "6", "pages": "606 - 617", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Xiaobing Liu", "Bo Zhang"], "keywords": ["compressed sensing", "image coding", "image recognition", "image representation", "learning (artificial intelligence)", "marketing", "search engines", "Internet", "ad-targeting", "automatic representative logo image collection", "brand protection", "commercial brands", "high-quality logo images", "logo detection system training", "logo recognition system training", "mean average precision", "multiple dictionary invariant sparse coding", "representative images", "search engine", "trademark infringement detection", "weak-labeled training images", "Dictionaries", "Encoding", "Image coding", "Image reconstruction", "Internet", "Search engines", "Training", "logo image", "multiple dictionary", "scale invariant", "shift invariant", "sparse coding", ""], "arnumber": "6678906"}
