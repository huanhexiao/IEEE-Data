This paper presents two strategies to analyze attacks by intermediate spoofing attackers to identify the weaknesses of such attacks. The analyses lead to a code and carrier phase consistency detection method with simulation results showing that this method can indicate the receiver when spoofing has occurred. The method can be used by most receivers, is inexpensive, and requires only a small software upgrade.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "599", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "605", "date_publication": "Dec. 2013", "inspec": "15568221", "date": "Dec. 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Dec 06 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "6", "pages": "599 - 605", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Yang Gao", "Hong Li", "Mingquan Lu", "Zhenming Feng"], "keywords": ["radio receivers", "satellite navigation", "telecommunication computing", "telecommunication security", "GNSS", "attack analysis", "carrier phase consistency detection method", "critical safety", "financial applications", "intermediate spoofing attackers", "intermediate spoofing strategies", "low cost detection", "off-the-shelf global navigation satellite systems receivers", "software upgrade", "Correlation", "Doppler effect", "Frequency estimation", "Global Positioning System", "Receivers", "Satellites", "Simulation", "code and carrier phase consistency", "dragging code phase strategy", "intermediate spoofing", "low cost countermeasures", ""], "arnumber": "6678905"}
