In this scheme, we try to achieve efficient queuing in the buffer of a centrally communicating MANET node through an active queue management strategy by assigning dynamic buffer space to all neighboring nodes in proportion to the number of packets received from neighbors and hence controlling packet drop probabilities. Our simulation study reveals that the proposed scheme is a way to improve the buffer management for packet queues in MANET nodes in terms of packet loss ratio, transmission efficiency, and some other important system parameters.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "543", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "553", "date_publication": "Dec. 2013", "inspec": "15568216", "date": "Dec. 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Dec 06 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "6", "pages": "543 - 553", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Muhammad Aamir", "Mustafa A.
