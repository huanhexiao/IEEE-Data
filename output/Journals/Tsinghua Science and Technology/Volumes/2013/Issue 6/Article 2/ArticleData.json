In the absence of appropriate safeguards, service users can still manipulate this feedback. Auction mechanisms have already addressed the problem of manipulation by markettrading participants. When auction mechanisms are applied to trust systems, their interaction with the trust systems and associated overhead need to be quantitatively evaluated. This paper proposes two distributed architectures based on centralized and hybrid computing for integrating an auction mechanism with the trust systems. The empirical evaluation demonstrates how the architectures help to discourage users from giving untruthful feedback and reduce the overhead costs of the auction mechanisms.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "554", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "567", "date_publication": "Dec. 2013", "inspec": "15568217", "date": "Dec. 2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Dec 06 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issue": "6", "pages": "554 - 567", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Suronapee Phoomvuthisarn", "Yan Liu", "Liming Zhu", "Ross Jeffery"], "keywords": ["electronic commerce", "software architecture", "trusted computing", "auction mechanism integration", "centralized computing", "distributed architectures", "empirical evaluation", "hybrid computing", "market-based model integration", "market-trading participants", "overhead cost reduction", "quantitative evaluation", "reputation-based trust mechanism", "service users", "trust systems", "trust-based service systems", "trustworthiness assessment", "untruthful feedback", "user feedback", "Cognition", "Computer architecture", "Economics", "Engines", "Protocols", "Quality of service", "Scalability", "economic mechanisms", "software architecture", "trust systems", ""], "arnumber": "6678901"}
