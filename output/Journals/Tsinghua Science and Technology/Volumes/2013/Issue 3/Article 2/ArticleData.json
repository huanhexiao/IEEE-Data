However, it is also well-known that shortest path routing suffers from uneven distribution of traffic load, especially in dense wireless networks. Recently, several new routing protocols are proposed in order to balance traffic load among nodes in a network. One of them is Circular Sailing Routing (CSR) which maps nodes on the surface of a sphere and select routes based on surface distances. CSR has been demonstrated with better load balance than shortest path routing via simulations. However, it is still open that what load distribution CSR can achieve. Therefore, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the traffic load distribution of CSR in a dense circular wireless network. Using the techniques developed by Hytti\u00e4 and Virtamo, we are able to derive the traffic load of any point inside the network. We then conduct extensive simulations to verify our theoretical results with grid and random networks.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "220", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "229", "date_publication": "June 2013", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2013", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 03 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "3", "pages": "220 - 229"}, "authors": ["Fan Li", "Xiao He", "Siyuan Chen", "Libo Jiang", "Yu Wang"], "keywords": ["circular sailing routing", "load balancing", "load distribution", "routing", ""], "arnumber": "6522581"}
