Cloud computing offers better stability and lower price than traditional IT facilities. Huge storage capacity is essential for video streaming service. More and more cloud providers appear so there are increasing cloud platforms to choose. A better choice is to use more than one data center, which is called multi-cloud. In this paper a closed-loop approach is proposed for optimizing Quality of Service (QoS) and cost. Modules of monitoring and controlling data centers are required as well as the application feedback such as video streaming services. An algorithm is proposed to help choose cloud providers and data centers in a multi-cloud environment as a video service manager. Performance with different video service workloads are evaluated. Compared with using only one cloud provider, dynamically deploying services in multicloud is better in aspects of both cost and QoS. If cloud service costs are different among data centers, the algorithm will help make choices to lower the cost and keep a high QoS.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "308", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "317", "date_publication": "June 2013", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2013", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 03 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "3", "pages": "308 - 317"}, "authors": ["Wei Chen", "Junwei Cao", "Yuxin Wan"], "keywords": ["Quality of Service (QoS)", "cloud computing", "data centers", "dynamic scheduling", "performanceevaluation", "service computing", "video streaming", ""], "arnumber": "6522589"}
