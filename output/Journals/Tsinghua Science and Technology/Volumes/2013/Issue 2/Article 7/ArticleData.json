This paper presents ManyInsights, a multidimensional visual analytics prototype that integrates several novel insight management approaches proposed by the authors in their previous work. These approaches include insight annotation, browsing, retrieval, organization, and association. This paper also reports a long-term case study that evaluated ManyInsights with a domain expert, realistic analytic tasks, and real datasets.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "171", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "181", "date_publication": "April 2013", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2013", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 30 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "2", "pages": "171 - 181"}, "authors": ["Yang Chen", "Jing Yang"], "keywords": ["insight management", "multidimensional visualization", "visual analytics", ""], "arnumber": "6509100"}
