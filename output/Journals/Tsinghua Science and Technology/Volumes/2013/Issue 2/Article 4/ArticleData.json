To simulate atmospheric nucleation activities, certain molecular models with three-dimensional (3-D) structures are generated. Analyzing these 3-D molecular models can help promote understanding of nucleation processes. Unfortunately, the ability to understand atmospheric nucleation processes is greatly restricted due to lack of efficient visual data exploration tools. In this paper, we present a data visualization solution to visualize and classify 3-D molecular crystals. We developed a novel algorithm for calculating similarity between the 3-D molecular crystals, and further improved the overall system performance with GPU (graphics processing unit) acceleration.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "137", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "144", "date_publication": "April 2013", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2013", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 30 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "2", "pages": "137 - 144"}, "authors": ["Kai Zhu", "Yanrui Liu", "Aseda Gyeke Aboagye", "Huaguang Song", "Jinzhu Gao"], "keywords": ["3-D molecular models", "GPU", "atmospheric nucleation", "similarity calculation", ""], "arnumber": "6509097"}
