We can thus model the users' daily status and interests according to their posts. Because of the high complexity and the large amount of the content of the microblog users' posts, it is necessary to provide a quick summary of the users' life status, both for personal users and commercial services. It is non-trivial to summarize the life status of microblog users, particularly when the summary is conducted over a long period. In this paper, we present a compact interactive visualization prototype, LifeCircle, as an efficient summary for exploring the long-term life status of microblog users. The radial visualization provides multiple views for a given microblog user, including annual topics, monthly keywords, monthly sentiments, and temporal trends of posts. We tightly integrate interactive visualization with novel and state-of-the-art microblogging analytics to maximize their advantages. We implement LifeCircle on Sina Weibo, the most popular microblogging service in China, and illustrate the effectiveness of our prototype with various case studies. Results show that our prototype makes users nostalgic and makes them reminiscent about past events, which helps them to better understand themselves and others.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "182", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "195", "date_publication": "April 2013", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2013", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 30 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "2", "pages": "182 - 195"}, "authors": ["Jiayu Tang", "Zhiyuan Liu", "Maosong Sun", "Jiahua Liu"], "keywords": ["keyword extraction", "microblogging", "sentiment analysis", "text visualization", "topic model", ""], "arnumber": "6509101"}
