However, when data become very large, visualizations often suffer from visual clutter as thousands of edges can easily overwhelm the display and obscure underlying patterns. Many edge-bundling techniques have been proposed to reduce visual clutter in visualizations. In this survey, we briefly introduce the visual-clutter problem in visualizations. Thereafter, we review the cost-based, geometry-based, and image-based edge-bundling methods for graphs, parallel coordinates, and flow maps. We then describe the various visualization applications that use edge-bundling techniques and discuss the evaluation studies concerning the effectiveness of edge-bundling methods. An edge-bundling taxonomy is proposed at the end of this survey.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "145", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "156", "date_publication": "April 2013", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2013", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 30 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "2", "pages": "145 - 156"}, "authors": ["Hong Zhou", "Panpan Xu", "Xiaoru Yuan", "Huamin Qu"], "keywords": ["edge bundling", "flow maps", "graph visualization", "parallel coordinates", "visual clutter", ""], "arnumber": "6509098"}
