In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of animated transition in a tiled image layout where the spiral arrangement of the images is based on their similarity. Three aspects of animated transition are considered, including animation steps, animation actions, and flying paths. Exploring and weighting the advantages and disadvantages of different methods for each aspect and in conjunction with the characteristics of the spiral image layout, we present an integrated solution, called AniMap, for animating the transition from an old layout to a new layout when a different image is selected as the query image. We show the effectiveness of our animated transition solution by demonstrating experimental results and conducting a comparative user study.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "157", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "170", "date_publication": "April 2013", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2013", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 30 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "2", "pages": "157 - 170"}, "authors": ["Huan Zhang", "Jun Tao", "Fang Ruan", "Chaoli Wang"], "keywords": ["animated transition", "image layout", "large image collections", "user study", ""], "arnumber": "6509099"}
