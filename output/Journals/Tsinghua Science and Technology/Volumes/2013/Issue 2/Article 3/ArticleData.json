However, ongoing efforts to achieve a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of turbulent flow are hindered by the difficulty of quantifying the complex, non-linear interactions between individual eddies in these flows. The difficulty of this task is compounded by the lack of robust methods for accurately identifying individual eddy structures and characterizing their dynamic evolution and organization across multiple scales. In this paper we address this problem by proposing several novel approaches for more accurately segmenting individual eddy structures in turbulent flows.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "125", "volume": "18", "lastpage": "136", "date_publication": "April 2013", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2013", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 30 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issue": "2", "pages": "125 - 136"}, "authors": ["Shengwen Wang", "Jack Goldfeather", "Ellen K.
