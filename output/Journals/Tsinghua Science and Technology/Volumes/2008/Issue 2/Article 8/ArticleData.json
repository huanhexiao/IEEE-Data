In the resin mold technique the sulphur in the P-toluol sulphonic acid (PTSA), usually used as the hardener, has been identified as one factor causing graphite degeneration at the metal-mold interface. Less than 0.15% S in the mold (or even less than 0.07% S) can reduce the surface layer depth. Oxygen may also have an effect, especially for sulphur containing systems with turbulent flows in the mold, water-bearing no-bake binder systems, Mg-Silica reactions, or dross formation conditions. Despite the lower level of nitrogen in the iron melt after magnesium treatment (less than 90 ppm), nitrogen bearing resins have a profound effect on the frequency and severity of surface pinholes, but a limited influence on surface graphite degeneration.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "157", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "163", "date_publication": "April 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "157 - 163"}, "authors": ["Lulian Riposan", "Mihai Chisamera", "Stelian Stan", "Torbjorn Skaland"], "keywords": ["Casting", "Coatings", "Iron", "Nitrogen", "Resins", "Surface treatment", "ductile iron castings", "nitrogen", "oxygen", "resin mold", "sulphur", "surface graphite degeneration", ""], "arnumber": "6071862"}
