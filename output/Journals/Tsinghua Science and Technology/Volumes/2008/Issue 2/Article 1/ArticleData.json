The conventional second fundamental tensor is replaced by the so-called conjugate fundamental tensor. Because the differential properties of the conjugate fundamental tensor and the first fundamental tensor are symmetrical, the symmetrical analytical system including the symmetrical differential operators, symmetrical differential characteristics, and symmetrical integral theorems for tensor fields defined on curved surfaces can be constructed. From the symmetrical analytical system, the symmetrical integral theorems for mean curvature and Gauss curvature, with which the symmetrical Minkowski integral formulas are easily deduced just as special cases, can be derived. The applications of this symmetrical analytical system to biology not only display its simplicity and beauty, but also show its powers in depicting the symmetrical patterns of networks of biomembrane nanotubes. All these symmetrical patterns in soft matters should be just the reasonable and natural results of the symmetrical analytical system.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "121", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "126", "date_publication": "April 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "121 - 126"}, "authors": ["Yajun Yin", "Jiye Wu", "Jie Yin"], "keywords": ["Equations", "Geometry", "Integral equations", "Junctions", "Nanotubes", "Tensile stress", "Vectors", "curved surfaces", "gradient operators", "integral theorems", "tensor fields", ""], "arnumber": "6071855"}
