Simulations of the mold filling and solidification sequences were used to analyze the problems of previous casting conditions with marked improvements for large cylinder liner parts. The amount and positions of chills were optimized to improve the mechanical properties and to minimize the shrinkage and micro porosity in the castings. Ultra sonic testing, penetration testing, and mechanical property testing show no defects in the castings with the productivity significantly increased.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "152", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "156", "date_publication": "April 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "152 - 156"}, "authors": ["S.
