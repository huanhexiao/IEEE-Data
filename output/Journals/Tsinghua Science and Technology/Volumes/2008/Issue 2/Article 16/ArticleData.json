This paper investigates the application of SOM in the representation and prediction of multi-dimensional traffic time series. First, SOMs are applied to cluster the time series and to project each multi-dimensional vector onto a two-dimensional SOM plane while preserving the topological relationships of the original data. Then, the easy visualization of the SOMs is utilized and several exploratory methods are used to investigate the physical meaning of the clusters as well as how the traffic flow vectors evolve with time. Finally, the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm is applied to the clustering result to perform short-term predictions of the traffic flow vectors. Analysis of real world traffic data shows the effectiveness of these methods for traffic flow predictions, for they can capture the nonlinear information of traffic flows data and predict traffic flows on multiple links simultaneously.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "220", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "228", "date_publication": "April 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "220 - 228"}, "authors": ["Yudong Chen", "Yi Zhang", "Jianming Hu"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Color", "Image color analysis", "Prediction algorithms", "Self organizing feature maps", "Time series analysis", "Vectors", "k-nearest neighbor (kNN)", "multi-dimensional", "self-organizing maps (SOM)", "time series", "traffic flow prediction", ""], "arnumber": "6071870"}
