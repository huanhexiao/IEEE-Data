The access cost is used to reflect the utility of the transportation system including the fatigue and inconvenience in the total cost. The cost is quantified by two coefficients which represent the different characteristics of various people. The average cost and the income-relative accessibility are used to describe various aspects of the accessibility and to evaluate the accessibility of a destination-based system. A case study uses data from the Kunming transportation system to evaluate the accessibility of the present city airport. The calibrated coefficients are then used to evaluate the transportation system to the new Kunming international airport. The results show that this transportation accessibility evaluation can be combined with transportation planning to study transportation sub-systems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "211", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "219", "date_publication": "April 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "211 - 219"}, "authors": ["Jing Shi", "Xiwen Ying"], "keywords": ["Airports", "Analytical models", "Fatigue", "Manganese", "Planning", "Utility theory", "airport", "cost of access", "cost of fatigue", "destination-based accessibility", ""], "arnumber": "6071869"}
