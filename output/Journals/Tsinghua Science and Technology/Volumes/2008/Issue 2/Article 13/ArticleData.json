The efficiency and effectiveness of VM workshops can be improved by better reusing the experience of previous VM cases and field knowledge. This paper describes a new approach to facilitate VM workshops in the construction industry using data mining (OM) techniques. The feasibility of integrating OM techniques with VM workshops in the construction industry is demonstrated in case studies. Examples are presented to illustrate different methods of applying OM tools in VM workshops. The results show that OM techniques can help team members in VM workshops to understand their problems more clearly and to generate more ideas for current problems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "191", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "201", "date_publication": "April 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "191 - 201"}, "authors": ["Qiping Shen", "Jianfeng Guo", "Jianping Zhang", "Guiwen Liu"], "keywords": ["Bridges", "Conferences", "Construction industry", "Data analysis", "Data mining", "Decision trees", "Delta modulation", "biodiesel", "biomass fuel", "blending", "diesel", "emissions", "ethanol", ""], "arnumber": "6071867"}
