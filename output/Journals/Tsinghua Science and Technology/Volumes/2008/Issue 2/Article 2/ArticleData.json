In order to determine their characteristics, a scanning electron microscope, an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and an optical microscopy were used to analyze the morphology, distribution, and composition of titanium-containing compounds in metal-lographic specimens and machined surfaces in four gray irons. The results show that the titanium-containing compounds in the gray irons are complex compounds containing V, Nb, Mn, S, and other metals, depending on the concentration of these elements in the iron. The number of titanium-containing compounds increases with increasing Ti content in the gray iron. Most of the titanium-containing compounds are located in the pearlite matrix, with some in the steadite and carbides. The results suggest that titanium-containing compounds reduce tool lifetime.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "127", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "131", "date_publication": "April 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "127 - 131"}, "authors": ["Daxin Zeng", "Yuanhao Zhang", "Jianyong Liu", "Hanjun He", "Xiaoxian Hong"], "keywords": ["Cast iron", "Compounds", "Manganese", "Scanning electron microscopy", "Surface morphology", "Titanium", "composition", "distribution", "gray iron", "machining", "titanium-containing compound", ""], "arnumber": "6071856"}
