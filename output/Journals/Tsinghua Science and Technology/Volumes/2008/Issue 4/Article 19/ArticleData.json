The features include: (1) a flexible way to derive an information rich phoneme set based on mutual information between a text corpus and its phoneme set; (2) a hidden Markov network acoustic model and a successive state splitting algorithm to generate its model topology based on a minimum description length criterion; and (3) advanced language modeling using multi-class composite N-grams. These features allow a recognition performance of 90% character accuracy in tourism related dialogue with a real time response speed.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "545", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "552", "date_publication": "Aug. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "545 - 552"}, "authors": ["Jinsong Zhang", "Takatoshi Jitsuhiro", "Hirofumi Yamamoto", "Xinhui Hu", "Satoshi Nakamura"], "keywords": ["Acoustics", "Context", "Hidden Markov models", "Mutual information", "Speech recognition", "Vectors", "Vocabulary", "Chinese speech recognition", "hidden Markov network", "minimum description length", "multi-class composite N-grams", "mutual information", "phoneme set design", "successive state splitting", ""], "arnumber": "6074163"}
