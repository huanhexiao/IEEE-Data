The present study verified the acute antidepressant effects of radix puerariae extract (PE) on PSD mice through behavior and gene expression experiments. CIR was found to reduce the sucrose consumption and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene expression. PE administration after CIR surgery was observed to significantly enhance the mRNA expression of TH in the hippocampus compared with the PSD group on Day 0 and Day 3 postsurgery. These findings indicate that PE contributes to the amelioration of behavior response in PSD mice, which is closely related with the protective effects of catecholamine synthesize against CIR brain damage.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "485", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "491", "date_publication": "Aug. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "485 - 491"}, "authors": ["Jiaqi Lan", "Bin Yan", "Yu'nan Zhao", "Daoyi Wang", "Jun Hu", "Dongming Xing", "Lijun Du"], "keywords": ["Antidepressants", "Biochemistry", "Hippocampus", "Mice", "Stress", "Sugar", "antidepressant", "cerebral ischemia reperfusion", "post stroke depression", "radix puerariae", ""], "arnumber": "6074154"}
