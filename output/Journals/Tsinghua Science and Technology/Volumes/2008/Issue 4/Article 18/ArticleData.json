With the entire speech-to-speech translation function being implemented into one terminal, it realizes real-time, location-free speech-to-speech translation. A new noise-suppression technique notably improves the speech recognition performance. Corpus-based approaches of speech recognition, machine translation, and speech synthesis enable coverage of a wide variety of topics and portability to other languages. Test results show that the character accuracy of speech recognition is 820/0\u2013940/0 for Chinese speech, with a bilingual evaluation understudy score of machine translation is 0.55\u20130.74 for Chinese-Japanese and Chinese-English.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "540", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "544", "date_publication": "Aug. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "540 - 544"}, "authors": ["Tohru Shimizu", "Yutaka Ashikari", "Eiichiro Sumita", "Jinsong Zhang", "Satoshi Nakamura"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Adaptation models", "Hidden Markov models", "Real time systems", "Speech", "Speech recognition", "Speech synthesis", "large-scale corpus", "machine translation", "speech recognition", "speech synthesis", "speech-to-speech translation", ""], "arnumber": "6074162"}
