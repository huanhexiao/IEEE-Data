The ceramide-containing liposomes prepared using ultrasonication contained CHEMS and the phytoceramide IV at a molar ratio of 1 :1. Gel chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography equipped with an evaporative light-scattering detection (HPLC-ELSD) were used to analyze the liposomes. The results show that the ceramide entrapment efficiency is over 900/0 and the molar ratio of phytoceramide IV to CHEMS is 1 :1.4. The ratio of ceramide to CHEMS as well as the ultrasonication duration affects the liposome properties. The phytoceramide IV encapsulated in the liposomes reduces the cellular activity of the murine mastocytoma cell line P815 in a dose-dependent manner and the reduction of cellular activity is due to cell apoptosis. 4, 6-diamidino 2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) staining further supports this result. The encapsulation of highly hydrophobic ceramides into liposomal formulations could become a potential candidate for enhanced apoptosis.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "447", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "453", "date_publication": "Aug. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "447 - 453"}, "authors": ["Song Chen", "Wenting Zhu", "Quan Zhou", "Guoqiang Chen"], "keywords": ["Biology", "Biomembranes", "Lipidomics", "Methanol", "Suspensions", "Tumors", "USA Councils", "apoptosis", "ceramide", "liposome", "murine mastocytoma", "phytoceramide IV", ""], "arnumber": "6074148"}
