Recently, a new SVM-based speaker verification method using GMM super vectors has been proposed. This paper describes the construction of a new speaker verification system and investigates the use of nuisance attribute projection and test normalization to further enhance performance. Experiments were conducted on the core test of the 2006 NIST speaker recognition evaluation corpus. The experimental results indicate that an SVM-based speaker verification system using GMM super vectors can achieve appealing performance. With the use of nuisance attribute projection and test normalization, the system performance can be significantly improved, with improvements in the equal error rate from 7.780/0 to 4.920/0 and detection cost function from 0.0376 to 0.0251.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "522", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "527", "date_publication": "Aug. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "522 - 527"}, "authors": ["Jian Zhao", "Yuan Dong", "Xianyu Zhao", "Hao Yang", "Liang Lu", "Haila Wang"], "keywords": ["Adaptation models", "Kernel", "NIST", "Support vector machines", "Testing", "Training", "Vectors", "Gaussian mixture model super vector", "NIST 06 speaker recognition evaluation", "nuisance attribute projection", "speaker verification", "support vector machines", "test normalization", ""], "arnumber": "6074159"}
