A large amount of calcium is absorbed from the medium and transported to mineralization sites during biomineralization in pearl oyster. This paper describes the cloning of the full-length cDNA of calreticulin from Pinctada fucata, namely PCRT. PCRT encodes a deduced 414-amino acid protein, which includes a predicted 17-amino acid signal peptide and an endoplasmic reticulum retrieval sequence HDEL. The protein shows 630/0\u2013760/0 sequence identity and shares some common characteristics with calreticulins from other species. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR indicates that PCRT is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues tested with the highest expression in the hemolymph and the mantle. In situ hybridiza\u00ad tion analysis of PCRT in the mantle showed strong signals in the inner fold, the inner side of middle fold, and the inner side of outer fold of the mantle epithelium. All these results suggest PCRT might be involved in Ca 2+ transport and storage during oyster biomineralization.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "466", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "473", "date_publication": "Aug. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "466 - 473"}, "authors": ["Weimin Fan", "Yilin Hu", "Changzhong Li", "Liping Xie", "Rongqing Zhang"], "keywords": ["Amino acids", "Calcium", "Cloning", "Erbium", "Polymers", "Proteins", "RNA", "Pinctada fucata", "biomineralization", "cDNA cloning", "calreticulin", "expression analysis", "mollusc", ""], "arnumber": "6074151"}
