However, in many public health problems, the data is longitudinal binary. There are few studies of change-point problems for longitudinal outcomes. This paper describes a flexible change-point model which includes random-effects and takes into account the difference between various individuals in longitudinal binary data. A transition function is used to make the linear-linear logistic model differentiable at the change-point. The location of the change-point is estimated using the maximum likelihood method. Adjustment of the transition parameter from zero to one controls the sharpness of the transition. The performance of this estimation procedure is illustrated with simulations using SAS/proc nlmixed and a detailed analysis of data relating hormone levels and ovary functions based on data from the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, Medical Center of Fudan University.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "553", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "559", "date_publication": "Aug. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "553 - 559"}, "authors": ["Xiaoru Wu", "Ying Yang"], "keywords": ["Biochemistry", "Data models", "Logistics", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Simulation", "Synthetic aperture sonar", "Vectors", "change-point", "dichotomous outcome", "logistic regression", "mixed-effects models", ""], "arnumber": "6074164"}
