However, tailoring a TTS voice font, or pruning redundant synthesis instances, usually results in loss of non-uniform synthesis instances. In order to solve this problem, we propose the concept of virtual non-uniform instances. According to this concept and the synthesis frequency of each instance, the algorithm named StaRp-VPA is constructed to make up for the loss of nonuniform instances. In experimental testing, the naturalness scored by the mean opinion score (MOS) remains almost unchanged when less than 500/0 instances are pruned, and the MOS is only slightly degraded for reduction rates above 500/0. The test results show that the algorithm StaRp-VPA is effective.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "515", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "521", "date_publication": "Aug. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "515 - 521"}, "authors": ["Wei Zhang", "Zhenhua Ling", "Guoping Hu", "Renhua Wang"], "keywords": ["Acoustics", "Databases", "Hidden Markov models", "Redundancy", "Signal processing algorithms", "Speech", "Viterbi algorithm", "non-uniform unit", "speech synthesis", "synthesis instance pruning", "text-to-speech system", ""], "arnumber": "6074158"}
