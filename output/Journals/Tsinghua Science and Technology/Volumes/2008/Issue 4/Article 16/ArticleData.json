To alleviate the problem, a maximum likelihood a priori knowledge interpolation (ML-AKI)-based handset mismatch compensation approach is proposed. It first collects a set of handset characteristics of seen handsets to use as the a priori knowledge for representing the space of handsets. During evaluation the characteristics of an unknown test handset are optimally estimated by interpolation from the set of the a priori knowledge. Experimental results on the HTIMIT database show that the ML-AKI method can improve the average speaker identification rate from 60.00/0 to 74.60/0 as compared with conventional maximum a posteriori-adapted Gaussian mixture models. The proposed ML-AKI method is a promising method for robust speaker identification.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "528", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "532", "date_publication": "Aug. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "528 - 532"}, "authors": ["Yuanfu Liao", "Zhixian Zhuang", "Jyhher Yang"], "keywords": ["Adaptation models", "Hidden Markov models", "Interpolation", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Robustness", "Speech", "Telephone sets", "Gaussian mixture model", "handset mismatch compensation", "maximum a posteriori", "maximum likelihood estimation", "robust speaker identification", ""], "arnumber": "6074160"}
