The spreading of the flame and smoke in the virtual fire was modeled based on numerical fire simulations, so that the conditions are similar to real life. A multi-grid, multi-base-state database model was used to overcome the disadvantages of traditional smoke spreading simulations. Textured images and particle systems provide visualization of the flame and smoke. The system immerses the user in a virtual environment with detailed interactions between the users and the virtual environment. The system can show which evacuation methods are effective for building safety evaluations.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "674", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "680", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "674 - 680"}, "authors": ["Aizhu Ren", "Chi Chen", "Yuan Luo"], "keywords": ["Buildings", "Data models", "Fires", "Numerical models", "Solid modeling", "Virtual environments", "emergency evacuation", "fire simulation", "virtual reality", "visualization", ""], "arnumber": "6074185"}
