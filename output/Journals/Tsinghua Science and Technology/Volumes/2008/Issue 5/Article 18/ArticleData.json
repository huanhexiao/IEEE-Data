A simple model of buyer offers' distributions was used to theoretically explore the determinants of housing liquidity in a search process. An empirical ordinary least squares model of the time-on-market was developed using data collected in four Chinese cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen). The results show that in these four Chinese cities, market maturity dominates the variation of housing liquidity, with the effects of housing characteristics, seller's search cost, search strategy, and market conditions being less significant to the time-on-market equation. These empirical results indicate that the slow turn-over of housing stock may constrain the overall level of housing liquidity in major Chinese cities.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "689", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "695", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "689 - 695"}, "authors": ["Jing Wu", "Siqi Zheng"], "keywords": ["Cities and towns", "Equations", "Floors", "Lead", "Marketing and sales", "Mathematical model", "Search problems", "housing liquidity", "housing stock", "market maturity", "time on market", ""], "arnumber": "6074187"}
