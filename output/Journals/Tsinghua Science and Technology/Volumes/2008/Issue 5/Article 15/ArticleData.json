Conventional polyvinyl alcohol fiber reinforced cementitious composites normally exhibit macroscopic strain-hardening and multiple cracking after the first cracks appear. However, the individual crack width at the saturated stage is normally 60 to 80 urn. In the current study, the effect of fine aggregate size on the cracking performance, especially the individual crack width in the strain-hardening stage was studied by bending tests. The results show that the individual crack widths can be reduced from 60\u201380 \u03bcm to 10\u201330 0\u201330 \u03bcm by modifying the particle size of the fine aggregates used in the composites.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "669", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "673", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "669 - 673"}, "authors": ["Jun Zhang", "Bing Leng"], "keywords": ["Concrete", "Optical fiber testing", "Permeability", "Strain", "Strain measurement", "Stress", "crack width", "fiber reinforced cementitious composites", "polyvinyl alcohol fibers", ""], "arnumber": "6074184"}
