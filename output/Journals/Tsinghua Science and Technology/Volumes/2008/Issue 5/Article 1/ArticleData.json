One male subject with a trans-tibial amputation volunteered for the study. The knee joint moments at the prosthetic side, the phase symmetry index, and the interface pressures were discussed under three sagittal alignment settings. The results show that the subject changes the knee joint moment, gait symmetry, and interface pressure with a misaligned prosthesis to improve his comfort and movement during walking. A high-quality liner reduces the gait sensitivity to misalignment and enhances the amputee's ability to compensate for misalignment. Since different people have different compensation patterns, more cases will be studied in future work.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "581", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "586", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "581 - 586"}, "authors": ["Xiaohong Jia", "Rencheng Wang", "Ming Zhang", "Xiaobing Li"], "keywords": ["Biomechanics", "Foot", "Joints", "Knee", "Legged locomotion", "Prosthetics", "Sockets", "interface pressure", "knee joint moment", "phase symmetry index", "prosthetic alignment", "trans-tibial amputee", ""], "arnumber": "6074170"}
