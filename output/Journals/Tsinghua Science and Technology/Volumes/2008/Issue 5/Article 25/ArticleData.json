The buildings in such old towns are usually made of highly combustible materials, such as wood and grass. If a fire breaks out, it will spread to multiple buildings, so fire spreading and controlling in old towns need to be studied. This paper presents a fire spread model for old towns based on cellular automaton. The cellular automaton rules were set according to historical fire data in empirical formulas. The model also considered the effects of climate. The simulation results were visualized in a geography information system. An example of a fire spread in Lijiang was investigated with the results showing that this model provides a realistic tool for predicting fire spread in old towns. Fire brigades can use this tool to predict when and how a fire spreads to minimize the losses.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "736", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "740", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "736 - 740"}, "authors": ["Nan Gao", "Wenguo Weng", "Wei Ma", "Shunjiang Ni", "Quanyi Huang", "Hongyong Yuan"], "keywords": ["Automata", "Buildings", "Cities and towns", "Fires", "Materials", "Vegetation", "Wind", "cellular automaton", "fire spread", "geographic information system (GIS)", "old town", ""], "arnumber": "6074194"}
