The filter uses data from a series of micro-electro mechanical system sensors to determine the selected 3 variables of the direction cosine matrix and the bias of the rate gyro sensors as state elements in a dynamic model, with the gravitational acceleration to build a measurement model. For high speed maneuvers, rigid motion equations are used to correct the measurements of the gravitational acceleration. The filter is designed to automatically tune its gain based on the dynamic system state. Simulations indicate that the Euler angles can be determined with standard deviations less than 3\u00b0. The algorithm was successfully implemented in a miniature attitude measurement system suitable for MAVs. Aerobatic flights show that the attitude determination algorithm works effectively. The attitude determination algorithm is effective and economical, and can also be applied to bionic robofishs and land vehicles, whose size and payload are also greatly limited.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "593", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "597", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "593 - 597"}, "authors": ["Cheng Liu", "Zhaoying Zhou", "Xu Fu"], "keywords": ["Acceleration", "Filtering algorithms", "Kalman filters", "Mathematical model", "Noise", "Position measurement", "Sensors", "Kalman filter", "attitude determination", "micro aerial vehicle (MAV)", "micro-electro mechanical system (MEMS)", ""], "arnumber": "6074172"}
