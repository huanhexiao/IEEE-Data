The moisture transport was described by a diffusion model with different diffusivities for drying and wetting. A finite difference scheme was developed to solve the partial differential equations. The influential depth was then investigated numerically for initially saturated and unsaturated concretes exposed to drying-wetting actions in marine environments using an equilibrium time ratio concept. The equilibrium time ratio was calculated numerically for a saturated condition and the moisture influential depth is shown to be a linear function of the square root of the drying time. However, this equilibrium time ratio does not exist for an unsaturated condition and the moisture influential depth depends on the initial saturation as well as the drying-wetting time ratio. The results indicate that this model gives more realistic predictions of moisture transport of in situ structural concrete and its durability.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "696", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "701", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "696 - 701"}, "authors": ["Chunqiu Li", "Kefei Li", "Zhaoyuan Chen"], "keywords": ["Absorption", "Boundary conditions", "Concrete", "Mathematical model", "Moisture", "Water", "concrete", "drying-wetting cycles", "durability", "influential depth", ""], "arnumber": "6074188"}
