Several potential reactive extractants were investigated for their selectivity of both 1-hexene to 2-hexene and 1-hexene to 3-hexene. With 3 molll AgN03-N-methyl-pyrrolidone (NMP) solution as extractant, the selectivity of 1-hexene to 3-hexane was increased to about 2.0 and the selectivity of 1-hexene to 2-hexene reached 1.5. Both the raffinate phase and the extracted phase were analyzed using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and a 50-m capillary column. The experimental results show that the silver nitrate NMP solution has the better selectivity than other reactive extractions.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "730", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "735", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "730 - 735"}, "authors": ["Fengxia Song", "Yanmei Yu", "Jian Chen"], "keywords": ["Chemicals", "Feeds", "Ions", "Silver", "Solvents", "Temperature", "TT-complex", "extraction", "olefin", "separation", ""], "arnumber": "6074193"}
