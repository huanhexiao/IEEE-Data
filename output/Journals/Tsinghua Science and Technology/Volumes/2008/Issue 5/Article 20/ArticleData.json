There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop an equitable financial evaluation method for PPP projects. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review that examines international practices. An equitable financial evaluation method was then developed taking into account the inherent characteristics of PPP projects using six separate indicators and Monte Carlo simulations. The result for a bridge project in Romania shows that the method combines the viewpoints of all the relevant stakeholders to achieve an equitable financial evaluation of PPP projects.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "702", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "707", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "702 - 707"}, "authors": ["Yongjian Ke", "Xinping Liu", "Shouqing Wang"], "keywords": ["Bridges", "Economic indicators", "Government", "Investments", "Risk analysis", "Vehicles", "financial evaluation", "public-private partnership (PPP)", "risk analysis", ""], "arnumber": "6074189"}
