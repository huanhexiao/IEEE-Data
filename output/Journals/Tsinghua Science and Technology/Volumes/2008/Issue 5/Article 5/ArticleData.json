The scaling and wavelet functions of the DB wavelet are used as basis functions to approximate the unknown field functions, so there is no need to construct costly shape functions as in the finite element method (FEM) and other meshless methods. In addition, the properties of the DB wavelets facilitate implementation of the method. The new method is used to analyze the elastic problem of a plain plate with a circle hole, and the numerical results agree well with the FEM. This method is effective and can be extended to solve complicated two or three dimensional problems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "605", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "608", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "605 - 608"}, "authors": ["Ya'nan Liu", "Yinghua Liu", "Zhangzhi Cen"], "keywords": ["Educational institutions", "Finite element methods", "Function approximation", "Shape", "Stress", "meshless method", "scaling function", "shape function", "wavelet", ""], "arnumber": "6074174"}
