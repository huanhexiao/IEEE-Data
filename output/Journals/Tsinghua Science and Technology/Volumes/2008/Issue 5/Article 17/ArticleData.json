Equations were developed to determine the deflections of the composite beam allowing for both joint flexibility and beam sectional properties, along with a formula for the connection secant stiffness. The equations for the connection stiffness are more accurate than previous equations used because it considers the beam-to-column stiffness ratio and the beam-to-connection stiffness ratio. The equations were validated by the experimental results for two semi-rigid composite frames. The equations agree well with the experimental data because they take into account the actual beam-to-column connections and the composite action between the steel beam and the concrete slab.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "681", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "688", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "681 - 688"}, "authors": ["Jingfeng Wang", "Guoqiang Li"], "keywords": ["Concrete", "Equations", "Joints", "Mathematical model", "Slabs", "Steel", "Structural beams", "composite action", "composite frame", "connection stiffness", "deflection", "semi-rigid", "serviceability", ""], "arnumber": "6074186"}
