A logistic model is used to describe the development of different traffic modes in the transportation network. The system is similar to the species competition model, so a two-species model is used to analyze the relationship between users based on the stability of the equilibrium points. The Lotka-Volterra model is then used to describe the multi-species cases with numerical examples, showing that this model can describe the effects of the road space distribution on the competitive user relationships. Policy makers must ensure the equity of road resources distribution so that each urban transportation mode is properly developed for sustainable social development.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "651", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "659", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "651 - 659"}, "authors": ["Xiwen Ying", "Jing Shi"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Economics", "Equations", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Roads", "Lotka-Volterra model", "competition model", "equity", "resource distribution", ""], "arnumber": "6074182"}
