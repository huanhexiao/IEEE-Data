The UAV flight control system is the key to a successful mission. This paper describes a low-cost micro-electro mechanical system-based flight control system for small UAVs. The integrated hardware flight control system weighs only 24 g. The system includes a highly-integrated wireless transmission link, which is lighter than traditional links. The flight control provides altitude hold control and global positioning system navigation based on gain scheduling proportional-integral-derivative control. Flight tests to survey the grass quality of a large lawn show that the small UAV can fly autonomously according to a series of pre-arranged waypoints with a controlled altitude while the wireless video system transmits images of the surveillance target to a ground control station.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "614", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "618", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "614 - 618"}, "authors": ["Xu Fu", "Zhaoying Zhou", "Wei Xiong", "Qi Guo"], "keywords": ["Aerospace control", "Global Positioning System", "Surveillance", "Vehicles", "Wireless communication", "Wireless sensor networks", "flight control", "global positioning system (GPS)", "micro-electro mechanical system (MEMS)", "navigation", "unmanned air vehicle (UAV)", ""], "arnumber": "6074176"}
