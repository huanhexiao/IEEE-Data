The coupled heat transfer and deformation were analyzed to simulate the formation of the air gap between the mold and the strand. The model was used to investigate the influence of mold taper on the temperature and stress distributions in the strand. The results show that the air gap mainly forms around the strand corner, causing a hotter and thinner solidifying shell in this region. The mold taper partially compensates for the strand shell shrinkage and reduces the influence of the air gap on the heat transfer. The mold taper compresses the shell and changes the stress state around the strand corner region. As the strand moves down into the mold, the mold constraint causes compressive stress beneath the corner surface, which reduces the hot tear that forms on the strand.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "598", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "604", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "598 - 604"}, "authors": ["Xin Luo", "Yong Chen", "Houfa Shen"], "keywords": ["Atmospheric modeling", "Casting", "Face", "Heat transfer", "Mathematical model", "Strain", "Stress", "continuous casting", "finite element model", "heat transfer", "mold taper", "stress", ""], "arnumber": "6074173"}
