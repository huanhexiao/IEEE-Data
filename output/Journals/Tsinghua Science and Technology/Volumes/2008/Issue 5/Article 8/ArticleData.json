Two one-factor experiments were designed on a simulated RVD system. One examined the video guidance and periscope monitoring methods, and the other examined three control complexity levels using one-axis RVD control, twoaxis RVD control, and three-axis RVD control. Eighteen male volunteers aged 22\u201335 participated in the experiments. The results show that the RVD operating time increases with control complexity. Based on the operators' findings, the two-axis control is the easiest. The monitoring method has no significant influence on failure rate with the low complexity using one-axis RVD control.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "619", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "624", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "619 - 624"}, "authors": ["Yijing Zhang", "Yongzhong Xu", "Zhizhong Li", "Jie Li", "Su Wu"], "keywords": ["Analysis of variance", "Attitude control", "Complexity theory", "Control systems", "Monitoring", "Space vehicles", "Training", "control complexity", "monitoring method", "spacecraft rendezvous and docking (RVD)", ""], "arnumber": "6074177"}
