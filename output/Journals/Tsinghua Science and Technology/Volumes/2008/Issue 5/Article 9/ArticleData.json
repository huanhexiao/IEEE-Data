The performance for three kinds of vehicular levels were compared using one-point and two-point crossover operations. The vehicle scheduling times are improved by the intelligent characteristics of the GA. The HGA, which integrates the genetic algorithm with a tabu search, further improves the convergence performance and the optimization by avoiding the premature convergence of the GA. The results show that intelligent scheduling of public vehicles based on the HGA overcomes the shortcomings of traditional scheduling methods. The vehicle operation management efficiency is improved by this essential technology for intelligent scheduling of public vehicles.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "625", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "631", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "625 - 631"}, "authors": ["Feizhou Zhang", "Xuejun Cao", "Dongkai Yang"], "keywords": ["Biological cells", "Genetic algorithms", "Genetics", "Optimal scheduling", "Vehicles", "genetic algorithm (GA)", "hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA)", "intelligent scheduling", "intelligent transportation system (ITS)", "public traffic", ""], "arnumber": "6074178"}
