A dynamic recrystallization and grain growth model was developed for the 20SiMn steel for common production conditions of heavy forgings by doing a nonlinear curve fit of the experiment data. Optimized forging parameters were developed based on the control of the dynamic recrystallization and the MnS secondary phase. The data shows that the initial grain size and the MnS secondary phase all affect the behavior of the 20SiMn dynamic recrystallization and grain growth.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "609", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "613", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "609 - 613"}, "authors": ["Lanfeng Dong", "Yuexian Zhong", "Qingxian Ma", "Chaolong Yuan", "Lishen Ma"], "keywords": ["Grain size", "Steady-state", "Steel", "Strain", "Stress", "20SiMn", "dynamic recrystallization", "flow stress", "grain growth", "secondary phase", ""], "arnumber": "6074175"}
