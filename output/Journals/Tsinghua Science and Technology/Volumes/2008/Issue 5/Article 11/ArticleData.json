The nonlinearity of the vehicle acceleration response at low speeds was analyzed to develop a transfer function model of the vehicle longitudinal dynamics using the least-mean-square system identification technique. This transfer function was then used to design the MMC controller, including an SMC feedback compensator. The system combines the advantages of the two control methods with robust control and rapid response. Simulations show that the controller enhances the rapid trackability to the vehicle acceleration and improves the system's robustness at low speeds compared with conventional PID MMC controllers.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "636", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "643", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "636 - 643"}, "authors": ["Yuejian Wang", "Yang Bin", "Keqiang Li"], "keywords": ["Acceleration", "Analytical models", "Control systems", "Roads", "Transfer functions", "Vehicle dynamics", "Vehicles", "model matching control", "nonlinearity", "sliding mode control", "stop-and-go cruise control system", ""], "arnumber": "6074180"}
