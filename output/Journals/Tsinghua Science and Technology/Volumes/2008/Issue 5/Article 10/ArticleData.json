Therefore, the results can have significant errors. To reduce the forecasting error produced by uniform trip generation rates for different traffic zones, the behavior of each traveler was studied instead of the characteristics of the traffic zone. This paper gives a method for calculating the trip efficiency and the effect of traffic zones combined with a destination selection model based on disaggregate theory for trip generation. Beijing data is used with the trip generation method to predict trip volumes. The results show that the disaggregate model in this paper is more accurate than the traditional method. An analysis of the factors influencing traveler behavior and destination selection shows that the attractiveness of the traffic zone strongly affects the trip generation volume.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "632", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "635", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "632 - 635"}, "authors": ["Liya Yao", "Hongzhi Guan", "Hai Yan"], "keywords": ["Data models", "Forecasting", "Predictive models", "Roads", "Solid modeling", "USA Councils", "attractiveness", "disaggregate model", "traffic demand forecasting", "trip generation", ""], "arnumber": "6074179"}
