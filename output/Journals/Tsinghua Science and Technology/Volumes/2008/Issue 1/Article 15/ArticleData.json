The equivalent circuits of the busbars and devices model are simulated in the electric simulator PSIM to analyze the effects of the parasitic inductance on the switching characteristics of the integrated gate commutated thyristor (IGCT) in different topology positions. The simulation results agree well with the measured impedance analyzer results and the IGCT test results, which proves the effectiveness of the modeling method for the large, complex busbars.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "91", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "97", "date_publication": "Feb. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "91 - 97"}, "authors": ["Rong Yi", "Zhengming Zhao", "Yulin Zhong"], "keywords": ["Equivalent circuits", "Finite element methods", "Impedance measurement", "Inductance", "Integrated circuit modeling", "Inverters", "Solid modeling", "busbars", "parasitic inductance", "partial element equivalent circuits", "switching characteristics", ""], "arnumber": "6071847"}
