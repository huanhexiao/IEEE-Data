The LRT-CS relies on detection probabilities of the local sensors, while the detection probabilities are a priori unknown for uncooperative targets. Also, for Nakagami fading channels, the LRT-CS involves an infinite series, which is cumbersome for real-time application. In contrast, the DSSF only involves data comparisons and additions and does not require the detection probabilities of local sensors. Furthermore, the performance of DSSF is only slightly degraded in comparison with the LRT-CS when the detection probabilities of local sensors are a priori unknown. Therefore, the DSSF should be used in a WSN with limited resources.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "Feb. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "23 - 29"}, "authors": ["Xiangyang Liu", "Yingning Peng", "Xiutan Wang"], "keywords": ["Decision support systems", "Fading", "Noise", "Probability", "Sensor fusion", "Wireless sensor networks", "Nakagami fading channel", "decision fusion", "distributed signal detection", "wireless sensor network", ""], "arnumber": "6071836"}
