When the target's trajectory follows a constant input/bias constraint, model mismatching caused by conventional tracking algorithms can be handled by a delayed update filter (DUF). The statistical convergence and stability properties of the delayed update filter were studied to insure the rationality of its steady-state analysis. A steady-state filter gain was then designed for a constant-gain DUF to reduce the computations without much performance loss. Simulations demonstrate the potential of the constant-gain DUF, and the CGDUF is nearly 60% faster than the DUF without much loss in steady-state tracking accuracy.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "35", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "42", "date_publication": "Feb. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "35 - 42"}, "authors": ["Yujing Liu", "Huadong Meng", "Desheng Wang"], "keywords": ["Covariance matrix", "Filtering algorithms", "Heuristic algorithms", "Mathematical model", "Steady-state", "Target tracking", "Vectors", "Kalman filter", "delayed update filter", "target tracking", ""], "arnumber": "6071838"}
