The neural network was used to obtain the mapping functions between the objective quality assessment indexes and subjective quality assessment. The SVM was used to classify the images into different types which were accessed using different mapping functions. Video quality was assessed based on the quality of each frame in the video sequence with various weights to describe motion and scene changes in the video. The number of isolated points in the correlations of the image and video subjective and objective quality assessments was reduced by this method. Simulation results show that the method accurately accesses image quality. The monotonicity of the method for images is 6.94% higher than with the PSNR method, and the root mean square error is at least 35.90% higher than with the PSNR.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "112", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "116", "date_publication": "Feb. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "112 - 116"}, "authors": ["Wenrui Ding", "Yubing Tong", "Qishan Zhang", "Dongkai Yang"], "keywords": ["Correlation", "Image quality", "Indexes", "PSNR", "Quality assessment", "Support vector machines", "Video sequences", "image quality assessment", "isolated points", "neural network", "support vector machines (SVM)", ""], "arnumber": "6071850"}
