This paper presents chance maximizing models for capital budgeting with fuzzy input data and multiple conflicting objectives. When the decision maker sets a prospective profit level and wants to maximize the chances of the total profit achieving the prospective profit level, a fuzzy dependent-chance programming model, a fuzzy multi-objective dependent-chance programming model, and a fuzzy goal dependent-chance programming model are used to formulate the fuzzy capital budgeting problem. A fuzzy simulation based genetic algorithm is used to solve these models. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the simulation-based genetic algorithm and the potential applications of these models.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "117", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "120", "date_publication": "Feb. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "117 - 120"}, "authors": ["Rui Liang", "Jinwu Gao"], "keywords": ["Biological cells", "Biological system modeling", "Computational modeling", "Genetic algorithms", "Linear programming", "Numerical models", "Programming", "capital budgeting", "dependent-chance programming", "fuzzy variable", "genetic algorithm", ""], "arnumber": "6071851"}
