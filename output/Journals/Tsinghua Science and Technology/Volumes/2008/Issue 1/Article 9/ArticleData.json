However, excessive qubits may make the quantum system vulnerable. This paper describes how to relax existing qubits without additional qubits to significantly reduce the operation time of the quantum Fourier circuit compared to a circuit without optimization. The results indicate that this scheme makes full use of the qubits relaxation. The concepts can be applied to improve similar quantum circuits and guide the physical implementations of quantum algorithms or devices.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "54", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "58", "date_publication": "Feb. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "54 - 58"}, "authors": ["Min Jiang", "Zengke Zhang", "Tzyh-Jong Tarn"], "keywords": ["Computers", "Logic gates", "Optimization", "Quantum computing", "Quantum dots", "Quantum entanglement", "Registers", "additional qubits", "optimization", "quantum Fourier circuits", "quantum gates", ""], "arnumber": "6071841"}
