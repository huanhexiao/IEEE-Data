The network quality-of-service (QoS) in those so-called networked control systems always fluctuates due to changes of the traffic load and available network resources. This paper presents an intelligent scheduling controller design approach for a class of NCSs to handle network QoS variations. The sampling period and control parameters in the controller are simultaneously scheduled to compensate for the network QoS variations. The estimation of distribution algorithm is used to optimize the sampling period and control parameters for better performance. Compared with existing networked control methods, the controller has better ability to compensate for the network QoS variations and to balance network loads. Simulation results show that the plant setting time with the intelligent scheduling controller is reduced by about 64.0% for the medium network load and 49.1% for high network load and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "71", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "77", "date_publication": "Feb. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "71 - 77"}, "authors": ["Hongbo Li", "Sun Zengqi", "Badong Chen", "Huaping Liu"], "keywords": ["Delay", "Gaussian distribution", "Monitoring", "Optimization", "Quality of service", "Switches", "estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA)", "network quality-of-service(QoS) variation", "network-induced delay", "networked control systems (NCSs)", "packet dropout", ""], "arnumber": "6071844"}
