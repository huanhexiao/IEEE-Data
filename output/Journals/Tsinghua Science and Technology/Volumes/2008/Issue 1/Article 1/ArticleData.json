The presence of CFOs between the transmitters and the uplink receiver will destroy the orthogonality among the different subcarriers, resulting in inter-carrier interference and multiuser interference. This paper proposes a pseudoinverse CFO compensation method based on the signal structure. The proposed method can compensate the CFOs of all users simultaneously and isolate the signals from all users at the same time. Compared with the existing CFO compensation methods, the new method provides a considerable signal-to-noise ratio gain on the bit error rate performance and has a relatively low implementation complexity.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "Feb. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "1 - 8"}, "authors": ["Da Fan", "Zhigang Cao"], "keywords": ["Bit error rate", "Convolution", "Discrete Fourier transforms", "Estimation", "Frequency conversion", "OFDM", "Transmitters", "carrier frequency offset (CFO)", "circular convolution", "orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access (OFDMA)", "pseudoinverse", ""], "arnumber": "6071833"}
