This method gives a closed form expression for the optimized hardware cost configuration based on the service requirements, the processing features of the computers running the core service platform software, and the processing capabilities of the common object request broker architecture middleware. Three simulation scenarios were used to evaluate the model. The input includes the number of servers for the protocol mapping (PM), Parlay gateway (PG), application sever (AS), and communication handling (CH) functions. The simulation results show that the mean delay meets requirements. When the number of servers for PM, PG, AS, and CH functions were not properly selected, the mean delay was excessive. Simulation results show that the model is valid and can be used to optimize investments in core service platforms.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "85", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "90", "date_publication": "Feb. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "85 - 90"}, "authors": ["Menghui Yang", "Weikang Yang", "Xiaoge Wang", "Jianxin Liao", "Junliang Chen"], "keywords": ["Delay", "Hardware", "Logic gates", "Next generation networking", "Protocols", "Servers", "Unified modeling language", "core service platform", "method of optimized computing", "next-generation network", ""], "arnumber": "6071846"}
