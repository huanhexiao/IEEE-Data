The central frequencies of the two peaks increase linearly with increasing temperature with temperature coefficients of 1.05 MHz/\u00b0C and 1.13 MHz/\u00b0C. The height difference between the two peaks decreases linearly with a coefficient of \u22120.06 dB/\u00b0C. The results show that microstructure fibers with a small core have great potential for fiber Brillouin distributed sensing.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "43", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "46", "date_publication": "Feb. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "43 - 46"}, "authors": ["Yanyan Pi", "Wei Zhang", "Yin Wang", "Yidong Huang", "Jiangde Peng"], "keywords": ["Optical fiber polarization", "Scattering", "Temperature measurement", "Temperature sensors", "fiber Brillouin distributed sensing", "microstructure fiber", "spontaneous Brillouin scattering", ""], "arnumber": "6071839"}
