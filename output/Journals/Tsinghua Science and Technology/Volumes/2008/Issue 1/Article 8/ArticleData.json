Soft sensing measurements provide real-time, flexible, and low-cost measurements appropriate for the overflow particle size distributions in hydrocyclones. Three soft sensing methods were investigated for measuring the overflow particle size distributions in hydrocyclones. Simulations show that these methods have various advantages and disadvantages. Optimal Bayesian estimation fusion was then used to combine three methods with the fusion parameters determined according to the performance of each method with validation samples. The combined method compensates for the disadvantages of each method for more precise measurements. Simulations using real operating data show that the absolute root mean square measurement error of the combined method was always about 2% and the method provides the necessary accuracy for beneficiation plants.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "47", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "53", "date_publication": "Feb. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "47 - 53"}, "authors": ["Zhe Sun", "Huangang Wang", "Zengke Zhang"], "keywords": ["Atmospheric measurements", "Particle measurements", "Real time systems", "Sensors", "Size measurement", "Support vector machines", "Training", "identification", "machine learning", "overflow particle size distribution", "soft sensing", ""], "arnumber": "6071840"}
