One of the challenges in designing application-specific networks is modeling the on-chip system behavior and determining on-chip traffic characteristics. A universal object message level model for SoNoC was defined and an object-oriented methodology was developed to implement this model in hardware and software. The model supports \u201cobject to core\u201d synthesis and \u201cfunction invoking to network\u201d mapping. A case study of an H.263 system verifies the model and methodology. System prototypes are easily built and on-chip traffic can be observed using the SoNoC model to provide real benchmarks for on-chip network design.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "98", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "105", "date_publication": "Feb. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "98 - 105"}, "authors": ["Liwei Ma", "Yihe Sun"], "keywords": ["Hardware", "Integrated circuit modeling", "Message systems", "Network interfaces", "Object oriented modeling", "System-on-a-chip", "Unified modeling language", "network-on-chip", "system-on-chip", "system-on-network-on-chip", ""], "arnumber": "6071848"}
