The two models have distinct advantages over existing methods for selecting vendors in fuzzy environments. A genetic algorithm based on fuzzy simulations is designed to solve these two models. Numerical examples show the effectiveness of the algorithm.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "106", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "111", "date_publication": "Feb. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "106 - 111"}, "authors": ["Junyan Wang", "Ruiqing Zhao", "Wansheng Tang"], "keywords": ["Aggregates", "Biological cells", "Genetic algorithms", "Numerical models", "Optimization", "Programming", "fuzzy simulation", "fuzzy variable", "genetic algorithm", "supply chain management", "vendor selection problem", ""], "arnumber": "6071849"}
