The development of efficacious IT infrastructure capability enhances business performance and brings sustainable competitive advantage. This study analyzed the IT infrastructure capability in a holistic way and then presented a concept model of IT capability. IT infrastructure capability was categorized into sharing capability, service capability, and flexibility. This study then empirically tested the model using a set of survey data collected from 145 firms. Three factors emerge from the factor analysis as IT flexibility, IT service capability, and IT sharing capability, which agree with those in the conceptual model built in this study.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "390", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "394", "date_publication": "June 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "390 - 394"}, "authors": ["Xianfeng Qi", "Boxiong Lan", "Zhenwei Guo"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Business", "Humans", "Information systems", "Information technology", "Reliability", "Software", "IT infrastructure", "flexibility", "service capability", "sharing capability", ""], "arnumber": "6071898"}
