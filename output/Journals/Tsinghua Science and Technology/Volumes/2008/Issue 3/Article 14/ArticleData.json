Incentives have a great influence on response rate, retention rate, and response quality in traditional surveys. The purpose of this paper is to investigate what kinds of incentives are effective in web-based surveys. This study summarizes the research framework of previous studies on the effect of incentives in web-based surveys to show that material incentives have a significant effect on web-based surveys with prepaid incentives having a moderate influence on raising the response rate. Contingent incentives significantly reduce the response rate. These findings provide guidance for web-based investigations.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "344", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "347", "date_publication": "June 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "344 - 347"}, "authors": ["Jie Su", "Peiji Shao", "Jiaminq Fang"], "keywords": ["Educational institutions", "Internet", "Market research", "Materials", "Postal services", "Recruitment", "Registers", "Internet", "contingent incentives", "incentives", "material incentives", "nonmaterial incentives", "prepaid incentives", "web-based surveys", ""], "arnumber": "6071891"}
