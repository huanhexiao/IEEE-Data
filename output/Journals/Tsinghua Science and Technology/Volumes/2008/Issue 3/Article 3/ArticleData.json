Many scholars have applied the classical TAM to various research domains. However, the relationships between variables in these TAM models are not strongly desired. Thirty-four articles selected from international journals were analyzed to show that most of the relationships in the classical TAM are significant, but the stabilities of these relationships differ. The significant positive relationships between perceived ease of use and its independent variables are more stable than the others. Various factors can strengthen or weaken these relationships.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "273", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "278", "date_publication": "June 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "273 - 278"}, "authors": ["Yuanquan Li", "Jiayin Qi", "Huaying Shu"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Bismuth", "Computational modeling", "Computers", "Information technology", "Internet", "Tin", "adoption", "information system", "technology acceptance model (TAM)", ""], "arnumber": "6071880"}
