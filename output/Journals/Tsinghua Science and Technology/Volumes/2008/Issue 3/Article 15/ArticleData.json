Based on an empirical study, this paper summarized the significance of IS strategic alignment and its impact on business performance. This study also measured business strategy, information system strategy, and information system strategic alignment, built a conceptual model to describe the relationship between these factors, and investigated their implications for information system performance and business performance. A structural equation model was employed to test the conceptual model. Analyses of data gathered in a survey indicate that information system strategic alignment is a better predictor of business performance than business strategy or information system strategy alone, although business strategy can significantly influence business performance.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "348", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "354", "date_publication": "June 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "348 - 354"}, "authors": ["Xiaoying Dong", "Qianqian Liu", "Dezhi Yin"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Companies", "Information systems", "Mathematical model", "Profitability", "Reliability", "business performance", "business strategy", "information system performance", "information system strategic alignment", "information system strategy", ""], "arnumber": "6071892"}
