An online survey posted on a campus BBS was conducted to collect research data with a total of 121 usable responses. The results support the motivational model and show that the explained variance of online learning system use behavior is 71.30/0 higher than that of the original TAM explanation.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "312", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "317", "date_publication": "June 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "312 - 317"}, "authors": ["Sheng Zhang", "Jue Zhao", "Weiwei Tan"], "keywords": ["Bismuth", "Educational institutions", "Electronic learning", "Information technology", "Internet", "Learning systems", "Mathematical model", "intrinsic motivation", "online learning system", "technology acceptance model (TAM)", ""], "arnumber": "6071886"}
