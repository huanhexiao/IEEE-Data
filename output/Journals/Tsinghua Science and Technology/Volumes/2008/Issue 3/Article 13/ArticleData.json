We propose the concept of IT absorptive capacity from an organizational level. A dynamic process model is developed to further analyze IT absorption. IT absorptive capacity of this process is embodied as six forms: identification, adoption, adaptation, acceptance, infusion, and knowledge management. By means of questionnaire surveys of 76 Chinese enterprises, the main factors that favor or disable the capacity of each stage are discovered. Using the method of system dynamics, a conceptual model of IT absorptive capacity is developed to analyze the action mechanism of the factors in detail. The model indicates that the critical factors are embodied in the aspect of management. Furthermore, it demonstrates that IT absorption is a spiral process, during which IT absorptive capacity evolves dynamically and, consequently, promotes IT use.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "337", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "343", "date_publication": "June 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "337 - 343"}, "authors": ["Xinhua Bi", "Cuiling Yu"], "keywords": ["Absorption", "Adaptation models", "Analytical models", "Information technology", "Knowledge management", "Organizations", "IT absorption", "absorptive capacity", "conceptual model", "information technology (IT)", ""], "arnumber": "6071890"}
