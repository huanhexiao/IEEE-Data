In this IDT-TAM framework, the perceived characteristics of innovation are categorized as subjective evaluation, objective conditions, and interaction factors. The cognitive mechanisms that drive user IT acceptance are analyzed based on the patterns through which these characteristics influence individual user IT adoption behavior. The model was tested using an empirical survey regarding the adoption and use of e-mail in China. Results from a structural equation model analysis illustrate that the model provides meaningful insights for understanding, explaining, and predicting the IT adoption behavior of Chinese users.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "306", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "311", "date_publication": "June 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "306 - 311"}, "authors": ["Nan Zhang", "Xunhua Guo", "Guoqing Chen"], "keywords": ["Adaptation models", "Analytical models", "Correlation", "Mathematical model", "Predictive models", "Reliability", "Technological innovation", "information technology adoption", "innovation diffusion theory (IDT)", "structural equation model (SEM)", "technology acceptance model (TAM)", ""], "arnumber": "6071885"}
