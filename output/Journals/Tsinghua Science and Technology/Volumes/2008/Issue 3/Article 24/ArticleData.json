A review of enterprise transformation theory identified five critical organization dimensions of e-business transformation, corporate strategy and vision transformation, organizational structure, product and market transformation, business process transformation, and corporate culture transformation. An e-business transformation process model was developed based on the five dimensions. This model can help enterprises to more effectively implement e-business transformation strategies.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "408", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "413", "date_publication": "June 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "408 - 413"}, "authors": ["Qingfeng Zeng", "Wenbo Chen", "Lihua Huang"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Educational institutions", "Information systems", "Internet", "Organizations", "Standards organizations", "e-business transformation", "information system", "organization dimension", "organization transformation", "process model", ""], "arnumber": "6071901"}
