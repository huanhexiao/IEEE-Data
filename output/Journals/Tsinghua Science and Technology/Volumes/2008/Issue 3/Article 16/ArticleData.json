The reference framework combines strategic information system alignment and dynamic capabilities perspectives. EIS implementations were analyzed in eight companies (four in China and four in Europe). Recommendations derived from this analysis can be used by Chinese EIS practitioners to effectively enhance organizational competitiveness through EIS implementation. The results show that Chinese companies must achieve a strategic alignment between their business strategy and EIS strategy and then they should facilitate EIS implementation by effectively designing managerial processes and learning mechanisms.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "355", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "361", "date_publication": "June 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "355 - 361"}, "authors": ["Xiaofeng Ma", "Lu Liu", "Jing Li", "Degang Cui"], "keywords": ["Companies", "Context", "Educational institutions", "Information systems", "Software", "dynamic capabilities", "enterprise information systems", "strategic alignment", ""], "arnumber": "6071893"}
