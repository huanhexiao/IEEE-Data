This paper describes the benefits and problems encountered in the joint development of accounting management information systems based on a real case. The case illustrates some distinct advantages, such as full control over the development schedule, the flexibility with resource allocation, and insurance for sustained active participation by the end-users. However, this development mode also involves potential problems, e.g., potential conflicts arising from diverse backgrounds and cultures of the various stakeholders and challenges to manage personnel from outside partners.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "414", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "419", "date_publication": "June 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "414 - 419"}, "authors": ["Jiye Mao", "Wenmo Song"], "keywords": ["Information systems", "Joints", "Lead", "Outsourcing", "Project management", "Software", "joint systems development", "management", "outsourced software development", "project", "user participation", ""], "arnumber": "6071902"}
