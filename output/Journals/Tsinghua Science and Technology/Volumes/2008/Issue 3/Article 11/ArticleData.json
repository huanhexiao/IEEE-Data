This paper presents an extensive review of the literature on IT/IS adoption to identify the key factors affecting small businesses based on comparison analysis. The review identifies the current interest in the adoption of Internet based IT and points out that the factors affecting different stages of the business lifecycle and research variables should be selected in terms of the different technology types. Especially, the review emphasizes the characteristics of external openings on the network in the research on e-commerce adoption. Future studies should focus on IT/IS adoption and implementation in small and medium-sized businesses during the development of small and medium-sized industrial clusters and specialty towns.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "323", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "328", "date_publication": "June 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "323 - 328"}, "authors": ["Xiaoping Yang", "Jing Fu"], "keywords": ["Biological system modeling", "Computational modeling", "Decision making", "Information systems", "Information technology", "Internet", "adoption", "information system", "information technology", "small business", ""], "arnumber": "6071888"}
