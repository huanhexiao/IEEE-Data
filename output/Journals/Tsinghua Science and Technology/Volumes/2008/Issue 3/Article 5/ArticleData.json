Thus, effective measures are needed to promote consumers' intentions to purchase in online consumer to consumer (C2C) stores. This paper postulates that five factors, the perceived ease of use of the website, perceived usefulness of the website, vendor competence, introduction and recommendations of third parties, and vendors' attitude toward customers, influence consumers' intentions to purchase in online C2C stores and this intention directly leads to their action to purchase from online C2C stores. The structural equation modeling (SEM) method was used to analyze empirical data, supporting these hypotheses except for the effect of vendor competence.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "287", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "292", "date_publication": "June 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "287 - 292"}, "authors": ["Dehua He", "Yaobin Lu", "Deyi Zhou"], "keywords": ["Business", "Educational institutions", "Electronic commerce", "Internet", "Mathematical model", "Numerical analysis", "Reliability", "consumer to consumer (C2C)", "electronic commerce", "model (TAM)", "purchase intention", "structural equation modeling (SEM)", "technology acceptance", ""], "arnumber": "6071882"}
