Many organizations are either in the process of adopting web services technology or evaluating this option for incorporation into their enterprise information architectures. Implementation of this new technology requires careful assessment of the needs and capabilities of an organization to formulate adoption strategies.

The methodology suggests that strategies, business areas, and functions within an organization should be considered based on the existing organizational information technology status during the process of adopting web services to support the business needs and requirements.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "383", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "389", "date_publication": "June 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "383 - 389"}, "authors": ["Liping An", "Jianyuan Yan", "Lingyun Tong"], "keywords": ["Companies", "Service oriented architecture", "Standards organizations", "business process", "enterprise application integration", "technology adoption", "web services", ""], "arnumber": "6071897"}
