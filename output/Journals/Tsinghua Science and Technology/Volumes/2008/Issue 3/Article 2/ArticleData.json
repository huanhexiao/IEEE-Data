This perspective may have limited the explanatory power of TAM when it is utilized in studying consumers' adoption intentions of online shopping. Based on the contrasts between e-commerce systems and traditional workplace information systems as well as empirical findings from a variety of recent e-commerce research works, this paper analyzes an extended model which integrates three additional constructs: trust, social presence, and perceived enjoyment. The interrelationship between these constructs is also explained. Empirical validations of this extended model are expected in future research.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "265", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "272", "date_publication": "June 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "265 - 272"}, "authors": ["Lingyun Qiu", "Dong Li"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Business", "Context", "Context modeling", "Electronic commerce", "Humans", "Internet", "B2C electronic commerce", "online shopping", "perceived enjoyment", "social presence", "technology acceptance model (TAM)", "trust", ""], "arnumber": "6071879"}
