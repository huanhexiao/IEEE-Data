Applying cybernetics and information processing theories, this study explores the relationship between organizational environment, inter-organizational coordination, IT support, and the effectiveness of interorganizational coordination. Using the case study method, data was collected from six manufacturing firms in China. The results show that inter-organizational system adoption is affected by organizational environment and is related to the management of inter-organizational coordination. Coordination and IT application affect the performance of inter-organizational coordination.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "374", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "382", "date_publication": "June 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "374 - 382"}, "authors": ["Gang Qu", "Shaobo Ji", "Qingfei Min"], "keywords": ["Automobiles", "Companies", "Information processing", "Interviews", "Manufacturing", "Standards organizations", "cybernetics", "information processing theory", "information technology (IT) application", "inter-organizational coordination", ""], "arnumber": "6071896"}
