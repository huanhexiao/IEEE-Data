Most building polygons' edges meet at right angles (orthogonal polygon). The integrated system partitions orthogonal building polygons into a set of rectangles and places rectangular roofs and box-shaped building bodies on these rectangles. In order to partition an orthogonal polygon, we proposed a useful polygon expression in deciding from which vertex a dividing line is drawn. In this paper, we propose a new scheme for partitioning building polygons and show the process of creating 3D roof models.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "368", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "374", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "368 - 374"}, "authors": ["Kenichi Sugihara", "Yoshitugu Hayashi"], "keywords": ["Buildings", "Indexes", "Shape", "Skeleton", "Solid modeling", "Three dimensional displays", "Urban planning", "3D building model", "3D urban model", "CG", "GIS", "automatic generation", "polygon partitioning", ""], "arnumber": "6073007"}
