However, the mechanical behavior of braced excavation has not been clarified fully both in theory and in experience. Therefore, improving the prediction accuracy during the prior design is very important for making the observational method of braced excavation more effective. In this paper, FEM analyses were performed for a model of braced excavation by using Geotechnical Finite Element Elastoplastic Analysis Software, GeoFEAS (20). As the constitutive law of ground, MC-DP model, and Duncan-Chang model were applied. The results were compared and discussed with that of a site measurement, and the effects of the constitutive law of ground on the analyzed result were verified. For the difference between the results, the reason was investigated by the analyses adjusting the elastic modulus of ground, and the appropriate application of the constitutive law was researched.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "40", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "45", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "40 - 45"}, "authors": ["Mingfei Li", "Atsushi Nakamura", "Fei Cai", "Keizo Ugai"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Analytical models", "Displacement measurement", "Finite element methods", "Materials", "Mathematical model", "constitutive law", "finite element method (FEM)", "numerical analysis", "retaining wall", ""], "arnumber": "6072955"}
