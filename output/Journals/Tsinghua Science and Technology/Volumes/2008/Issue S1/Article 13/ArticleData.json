We first identify practical constraints in solving resourcetracking problems in an enclosed or partially covered environment. We then compare pros and cons of available localization principles and examine the latest wireless communication technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and ZigBee. We find that the ZigBee-based wireless sensor network and the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) localization method are most promising to tackle on-site tracking of construction resources. Finally, we anticipate some application challenges associated with deploying wireless sensor networks for resources tracking in the practical context.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "78", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "83", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "78 - 83"}, "authors": ["Xuesong Shen", "Wu Cheng", "Ming Lu"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Bluetooth", "Buildings", "IEEE 802.11 Standards", "Wireless networks", "Wireless sensor networks", "Zigbee", "ZigBee", "building construction site", "signal strength", "tracking", "wireless sensor network", ""], "arnumber": "6072961"}
