The objective is to provide inspectors and professionals with better tools to allow them to examine the imagery for condition assessment. We present initial results of a collaboration with a robotic company through a case study on computer-assisted processing and interpretation of sewer pipeline inspection imagery. In the mean time, the described enhancement and interpretation methodology can also be applied to sewer pipeline condition assessment in an offline mode, where this methodology can support professionals' examination of acquired sewer condition imagery.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "375", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "380", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "375 - 380"}, "authors": ["Wei Guo", "Lucio Soibelman", "James H Garrett"], "keywords": ["Feature extraction", "Histograms", "Image enhancement", "Inspection", "Lighting", "Pipelines", "Visualization", "classification", "defects", "detection", "image processing and analysis", "infrastructure assessment", "region of interest", "remote visual inspection", ""], "arnumber": "6073008"}
