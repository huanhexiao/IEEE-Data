This system consists of three parts, the modeling for the land and buildings using GIS data, the analysis of disaster evacuation using multi-agent model, and the visualization for the numerical results using the virtual reality technique. By introducing the numerical solver of the natural disaster to the present system, it is possible to evaluate not only the damage of structure but also the damage of human being. Furthermore, it is possible to investigate the appropriate evacuation route by the simulation. The Dijkstra algorithm is used to obtain shortest route to the refuge. In addition, the visualization using virtual reality technique is curried out to understand the feeling of refugee. The present system is applied to the evacuation analysis by the flood flow in urban area and is shown to be a useful tool to investigate the damage by natural disasters.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "348", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "353", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "348 - 353"}, "authors": ["Keisuke Uno", "Kazuo Kashiyama"], "keywords": ["Animation", "Buildings", "Data models", "Floods", "Numerical models", "Roads", "Solid modeling", "GIS", "evacuation analysis", "flood flow", "multi agent model", "virtual reality", ""], "arnumber": "6073004"}
