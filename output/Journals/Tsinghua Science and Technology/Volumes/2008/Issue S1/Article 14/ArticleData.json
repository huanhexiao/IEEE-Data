The modeling method using GIS/CAD data is employed. The stabilized parallel finite element method based on SUPG/PSPG method is employed for the analysis of wind flows. The present method is applied to the simulation of wind flow and contaminant spread in urban area. The visualization based on virtual reality is employed to evaluate the mesh quality and computational results. The computed results are qualitatively in agreement with the experimental results and actual phenomena. The present method is shown to be a useful tool to simulate the wind flows in urban area.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "84", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "89", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "84 - 89"}, "authors": ["Kazuo Kashiyama", "Tomosato Takada", "Hideo Miyachi"], "keywords": ["Buildings", "Computational modeling", "Data models", "Design automation", "Finite element methods", "Solid modeling", "Urban areas", "CAD/GIS", "urban area", "virtual reality", "wind flows", ""], "arnumber": "6072962"}
