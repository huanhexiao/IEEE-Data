The load-displacement curves and their characteristics, namely, the curvature of the loading path, C, and the ratio of the remaining and total work done, WR/ WT, can be conveniently obtained from finite element simulations for various elasto-plastic material properties. The paper reports the comparative study on two reverse neural networks algorithms involving several combinations of databases established from the results obtained from simulated indentation tests. The performance of each set of results is analyzed and the most appropriate algorithm identified and reported. The approach with the selected neural networks model has great potential in practical applications on the characterization of a small volume of materials.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "393", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "399", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "393 - 399"}, "authors": ["Somsak Swaddiwudhipong", "Edy Harsono", "Liu Zishun"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Analytical models", "Artificial neural networks", "Finite element methods", "Material properties", "Support vector machines", "artificial neural networks", "finite element simulation", "friction", "indentation tests", "least square support vector machines", "material characterization", ""], "arnumber": "6073011"}
