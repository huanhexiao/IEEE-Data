This device is comprised of a hydraulic jack, check valve, relief valve, and throttle valve. The numerical analysis model for SAP2000 nonlinear analysis program is proposed to simulate the energy-dissipating characteristics of VDHD. The analysis results of this model compared with the seismic resistant tests reveal that this proposed model can accurately describe the actual energy-dissipating behavior of VDHD. The efficiency of VDHD is confirmed using this proposed model for carrying out numerical analyses of bare building, building added with bulking resistant bracing (BBR), and VDHD. The energy-dissipating capabilities of VDHD are performing excellent displacement and acceleration control with various ground magnitudes; being an energy absorber to absorb mechanical energy in the structure and resist structural movement; and gathering the advantage of BRB.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "6", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "1 - 6"}, "authors": ["Wen-Pei Sung", "Ming-Hsiang Shih"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Earthquakes", "Force", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Shock absorbers", "Valves", "shock absorption", "simulated model for SAP2000", "structural control", "velocity and displacement dependent hydraulic damper", ""], "arnumber": "6072949"}
