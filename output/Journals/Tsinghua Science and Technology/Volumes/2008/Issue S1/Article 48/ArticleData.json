In order to greatly improve the EEDB, the next generation EEDB software that makes use of latest technologies needs to be developed. This paper mainly focuses on establishing the model of the next generation EEDB software. Based on the investigation of literatures and the interviews to the designers, the requirements on the next generation EEDB software were identified, where the lifecycle assessment on both energy consumption and environmental impacts, 3D graphics support, and building information modeling (BIM) support were stressed. Then the workflow for using the next generation EEDB software was established. Finally, based on the workflow, the framework model for the software was proposed, and the partial models and the corresponding functions were systematically analyzed. The model lays a solid foundation for developing the next generation EEDB software.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "298", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "304", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "298 - 304"}, "authors": ["Zhiliang Ma", "Yili Zhao"], "keywords": ["Building services", "Data models", "Energy efficiency", "Next generation networking", "Software", "Solid modeling", "building information modeling (BIM)", "energy efficient design for buildings", "framework model", "industry foundation classes (IFC)", "partial models", ""], "arnumber": "6072996"}
