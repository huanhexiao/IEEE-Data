This technique is widely used in software engineering and manufacturing industry, and proved to be successful to perform product defining tasks. This paper describes an FPS-oriented approach for construction briefing, which is critical to the successful delivery of construction projects. Three techniques, i.e., function analysis system technique, shared space, and computer-aided toolkit, are incorporated into the proposed approach. A computer-aided toolkit is developed to facilitate the implementation of FPS in the briefing processes. This approach can facilitate systematic, efficient identification, clarification, and representation of client requirements in trail running. The limitations of the approach and future research work are also discussed at the end of the paper.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "292", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "297", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "292 - 297"}, "authors": ["Xiaochun Luo", "Qiping Shen"], "keywords": ["Buildings", "Cognition", "Computers", "Conferences", "Graphics", "Proposals", "briefing", "computer aided", "function analysis system technique", "functional performance specification (FPS)", "shared space", "value management (VM)", ""], "arnumber": "6072995"}
