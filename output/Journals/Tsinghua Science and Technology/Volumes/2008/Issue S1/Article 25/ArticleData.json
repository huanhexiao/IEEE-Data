This paper provides an integrated model of radio-frequency identification (RFID) and four-dimensional Computer-Aided Design (4D CAD) in construction management. RFID involves the use of tags that collect data and transmit data. RFID can collect data by radio waves instead of light waves. RFID technology is surpassing barcode technology where light waves are easily blocked and barcode labels are easy to fall off or become unreadable due to dust, dirt, or other contaminants. 4D CAD which involves 3D construction models and construction schedules presents visualized construction process. Integration of RFID and 4D CAD in this paper built a dynamic construction management and control system which would reduce the time of capturing data on site and control quality of construction materials efficiently. Pilot test result shows that a construction manager can easily understand how and what a complicated construction project will be accomplished. Although further analysis is necessary, RFID and 4D CAD show promises of being a beneficial technology in construction management.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "151", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "157", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "151 - 157"}, "authors": ["Wenfa Hu"], "keywords": ["Design automation", "RFID tags", "Schedules", "Solid modeling", "Steel", "Three dimensional displays", "con struction management", "construction schedule", "construction visualization", "four dimensional computer-aided design (40 CAD)", "radio frequency identification (RFID)", ""], "arnumber": "6072973"}
