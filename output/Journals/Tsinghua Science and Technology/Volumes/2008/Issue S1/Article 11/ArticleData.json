The framework consists of two main steps: data preparation and parallel solution. The parallel solution is performed by a substructure based method with direct solvers. The aim of the data preparation step is to create the best possible substructures so that the parallel solution time is minimized. An actual structural model was solved utilizing both homogeneous and heterogeneous PC clusters to illustrate the performance and applicability of the presented framework.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "65", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "70", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "65 - 70"}, "authors": ["Ozgur Kurc", "Semih Ozmen"], "keywords": ["Clustering algorithms", "Computational modeling", "Computers", "Equations", "Finite element methods", "Partitioning algorithms", "Symmetric matrices", "heterogeneous clusters", "homogeneous clusters", "parallel solution", "partitioning", "repartitioning", "substructure", "workload bal ancing", ""], "arnumber": "6072959"}
