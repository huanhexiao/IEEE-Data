This paper addresses the problem of binding the growing number of IFC versions and their EXPRESS definitions to programming environments (Java and .NET). The solution developed in this paper automates the process of generating early binding classes, whenever a new version of the IFC model is released. Furthermore, a runtime instantiation of the generated early binding classes takes place by importing IFC-STEP ISO 10303-P21 models. The user can navigate the IFC STEP model with relevance to the defining EXPRESS-schema, modify, delete, and create new instances. These functionalities are considered to be a basis for any IFC based implementation. It enables researchers to experiment the IFC model independently from any software application.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "126", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "131", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "126 - 131"}, "authors": ["Mohamed Nour", "Karl Beucke"], "keywords": ["Data models", "ISO standards", "Java", "Libraries", "Object oriented modeling", "Solid modeling", "EXPRESS", "IFC", "Java", "NET", "STEP", "bindings", ""], "arnumber": "6072969"}
