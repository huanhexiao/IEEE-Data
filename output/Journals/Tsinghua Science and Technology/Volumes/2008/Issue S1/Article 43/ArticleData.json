However, so far applications are limited to partial period and part of the structure because of immeasurable artificial intervention. Based on the building information model (BIM) and four-dimensional (40) technology, this paper proposes an improves structure analysis method, which can generate structural geometry, resistance model, and loading conditions automatically by a close interlink of the schedule information, architectural model, and material properties. The method was applied to a safety analysis during a continuous and dynamic simulation of the entire construction process. The results show that the organic combination of the BIM, 40 technology, construction simulation, and safety analysis of time-dependent structures is feasible and practical. This research also lays a foundation for further researches on building lifecycle management by combining architectural design, structure analysis, and construction management.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "266", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "272", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "266 - 272"}, "authors": ["Zhenzhong Hu", "Jianping Zhang", "Ziyin Deng"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Buildings", "Load modeling", "Safety", "Schedules", "Solid modeling", "Three dimensional displays", "building information model (BIM)", "construction simulation", "four dimensional (4D) technology", "industry foundation class", "structure analysis", ""], "arnumber": "6072991"}
