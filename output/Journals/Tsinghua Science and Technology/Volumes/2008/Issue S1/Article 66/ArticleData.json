The CAD data is used for the shape modeling for the high-storied buildings and civil structures with complicated shape since the data for that is not included in the 3D-GIS data accurately. The unstructured mesh based on the tetrahedron element is employed in order to express the urban structures with complicated shape accurately. It is difficult to understand the quality of shape model and mesh by the conventional visualization technique. In this paper, the stereoscopic visualization using virtual reality (VR) technology is employed for the verification of the quality of shape model and mesh. The present system is applied to the atmosphere environmental simulation in urban area and is shown to be an useful planning and design tool to investigate the atmosphere environmental problem.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "412", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "417", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "412 - 417"}, "authors": ["Tomosato Takada", "Kazuo Kashiyama"], "keywords": ["Atmospheric modeling", "Computational modeling", "Data models", "Design automation", "Shape", "Solid modeling", "Urban areas", "CAD/GIS", "atmosphere environmental simulation", "mesh generation", "stereo scopic visualization", "urban modeling", "virtual reality", ""], "arnumber": "6073014"}
