The complexity of building plans, however, makes it difficult for the efficiency evaluation. This paper presents a computational model AutoEscape, which can simulate the evacuation process for any given occupant distribution in buildings. Designed as an extensible multi-level structure, the model constructs the geometry level and occupant level and establishes the interactions between levels. The GIS-based environmental analysis is realized to automatically generate the geometric representation and formulate the cognition of agents. The multi-agent based technology is employed to simulate the crowd behaviors with autonomously acting individuals. A visualization component, which provides 3D free observations for the simulation process, is developed on the platform of OGRE and integrated into the system interface in form of ActiveX control. Finally, a case study has been conducted and the results have been compared with the results of an existing model to show the reliability and capacity of AutoEscape simulation.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "58", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "64", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "58 - 64"}, "authors": ["Fangqin Tang", "Xin Zhang"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Floors", "Geographic Information Systems", "Geometry", "Graphics", "Object oriented modeling", "ActiveX control", "evacuation simulation", "geographic information system (GIS)", "multi-agent modeling", "object oriented graphics rendering engine (OGRE)", ""], "arnumber": "6072958"}
