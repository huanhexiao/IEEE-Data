It employs semiotic theory which approaches the interpreter's understanding of the role of the representations used in construction documents to communicate meanings to other participants. This strategy is designed to aid the interpreters' comprehension of the use of symbols. The symbols within the construction documents are forms of representations that take the form of a visual representation of a set of markers that describe a formal language, and of markers that are used to represent natural language as well as other possible representations, such as a collection of codes for indexing documents. Symbols are replaced by signs under the semiotics theory. The use of symbols as signs is this study's recognition of the relationship between the interpreter and the material quality of symbols. The semiotic analysis is an examination of the compromise between the meanings of a representation per se and the concept associated with the understanding of such representation.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "192", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "198", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "192 - 198"}, "authors": ["Ivan Mutis", "Raja R.
