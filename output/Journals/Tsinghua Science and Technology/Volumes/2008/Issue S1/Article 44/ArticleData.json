The current paperbased method of tendering has been commonplace within the industry for a significant number of years, but with recent technological advancements, this traditional process is rapidly becoming outdated. Several major projects within the UK are now being procured through the e-tendering process which includes the multibillion pound development for the Olympic Games in London 2012. However, while these prestigious projects are embracing e-tendering technology, it is not certain as to what extent e-tendering is used across the construction sector generally. This research is primarily concerned with establishing the current status, practicalities and resource effectiveness of e-tendering within UK construction. Results are provided from an industry survey which includes both quantitative and qualitative data. A case study implementation is also included which assesses the utilisation of e-tendering software in practice. The research findings indicated that e-tendering can provide substantial resource savings to a major part of the supply chain, with the key benefits being enhanced communication, time savings and reduced costs. However, a considerable proportion of the industry remains uncertain about embracing new technologies, with reluctance to change being perceived as the greatest barrier. The findings suggest that many professionals within the UK construction industry recognise a requirement for increased implementation of e-tendering, but feel that training, education and support from senior management are essential requirements for e-tendering to become widely accepted in the future.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "273", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "278", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "273 - 278"}, "authors": ["Geoff Lindsley", "Paul Stephenson"], "keywords": ["Companies", "Documentation", "Industries", "Interviews", "Software", "Supply chains", "Training", "construction", "e-tendering", "electronic communications", "project data", ""], "arnumber": "6072992"}
