The platform is based on a hybrid-model approach consisting of a model-based information management system and a resource management system, the latter also referred to as OCMS. Project key information can be accessed via the main user interface, the \u201cgraphical navigator\u201d. The graphical navigator provides also a direct access to additional information in the OCMS. Prompt reaction in exceptional situations as well as in daily work gets an extensive support. In practical applications it has been proven that this platform seems to be an adequate tool especially for risk assessment and management in geotechnical engineering projects. Components and advantages of the platform as well as experiences from the applications are presented and discussed in the paper.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "132", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "137", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "132 - 137"}, "authors": ["Peter Oegebrodt", "Marcus Mejstik", "Frank Rackwltz", "Stavros Savidis", "Frank Schley", "Klaus-Peter Holz"], "keywords": ["Companies", "Information systems", "Internet", "Monitoring", "Protocols", "Risk management", "Unified modeling language", "geotechnical engineering", "information &#x0026", "execution &#x0026", "risk management", "internet", "monitoring", ""], "arnumber": "6072970"}
