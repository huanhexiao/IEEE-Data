However, traditionally, the concerned studies are performed separately for different objectives and difficult to perform an overall evaluation. A new multi-dimensional integration model and methodology for fire safety assessment were presented and two newly developed integrated systems were introduced to demonstrate the function of integration simulation technology in this paper. The first one is the analysis on the fire-resistant behaviors of whole structure under real fire loads. The second one is the study on fire evaluation and emergency rescue of campus based on geography information technology (GIS). Some practical examples are presented to illuminate the advantages of computer integration technology on fire safety assessment and emphasize some problems in the simulation. The results show that the multi-dimensional integration model offers a new way and platform for the integrating fire safety assessment of whole structure or region, and the integrated software developed is the useful engineering tools for cost-saving and safe design.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "387", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "392", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "387 - 392"}, "authors": ["Jianyong Shi", "Yinqing Li", "Huchuan Chen"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Buildings", "Computational modeling", "Fires", "Solid modeling", "Steel", "fire safety", "fire simulation", "integrated system", "large space building", "steel structure", ""], "arnumber": "6073010"}
