In order to investigate the performance, capacity and failure mechanism of the connections, two 1/5.5-scale specimens were tested under monotonic axial loading. The parameters in the study were the separation angle between columns. While the test was being conducted, the deflection, stress, failure pattern and capacity of the specimens were obtained and analyzed. In addition, the connection was analyzed using the general finite element analysis (FEA) software ABAQUS, with the purpose of investigating the mechanism, the weakness, the distribution of stress, and the bearing capacity of the connections. Experimental and numerical results indicate that the connecting separation angles resulted in the difference of failure modes and the mechanical behavior of the connections was similar to the behavior of CFST short columns.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "108", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "113", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "108 - 113"}, "authors": ["Xiaolei Han", "Chao Huang", "Jing Ji", "Jianying Wu"], "keywords": ["Concrete", "Electron tubes", "Load modeling", "Loading", "Steel", "Strain", "Stress", "concrete filled steel tubular (CFST)", "connection", "diagrid structure", "finite ele ment analysis (FEA)", "nonlinear analysis", ""], "arnumber": "6072966"}
