Since 2001 ten terror attacks have been thwarted only in Great Britain. For that reason the aim of the presented research project is to develop a solution for response and recovery to support rescuers in finding the shortest way within a public building and provide them with important information in their particular spatial context. Existing building information models (BIM) are used for displaying plans on mobile devices and for routing purposes. The indoor navigation system is based on wireless LAN (WLAN), ultra-wide-band (UWB), and radio frequency identification (RFID). These technologies are described in detail and an overview on data formats which are used to retrieve building data out of the BIM for generating routing networks is given.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "362", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "367", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "362 - 367"}, "authors": ["Uwe Rueppel", "Kai Marcus Stuebbe"], "keywords": ["Buildings", "Fires", "Mobile handsets", "Navigation", "Routing", "Sensors", "Wireless LAN", "BIM", "RFIO", "UWB", "WLAN", "disaster preparedness", "indoor positioning", "response and recovery", ""], "arnumber": "6073006"}
