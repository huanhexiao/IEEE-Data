The previous researches show that the optimization of the restoration schedule by using genetic algorithm (GA) is powerful. However, those are not considering the uncertain environment after earthquake disasters. The circumstances of the damage at devastated areas are very changeable due to the aftershock, fire disaster and bad weather. In addition, the restoring works may delay by unexpected accidents. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain the restoration schedule which has robustness, because the actual restoring works could not progress smoothly under the uncertain environment. GA considering uncertainty (GACU) can treat various uncertainties involved, but it is difficult to obtain the robust schedule. In this study, an attempt is made to develop a decision support system of the optimal restoration scheduling by using the improved GACU.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "400", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "405", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "400 - 405"}, "authors": ["Hitoshi Furuta", "Ken Ishibashi", "Koichiro Naka Tsu", "Shun Hotta"], "keywords": ["Delay", "Earthquakes", "Genetic algorithms", "Roads", "Robustness", "Schedules", "Uncertainty", "delay of schedule", "genetic algorithm", "restoration schedule", "uncertainty", ""], "arnumber": "6073012"}
