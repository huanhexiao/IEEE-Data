The resulting system has a simulation component that is based on the high-level architecture (HLA) and an agent component that implements the belief-desireintention (BOI) approach to agent modelling. The architecture is connected to a real-time information source. The framework was successfully applied to a real-life monitoring system for a tunnel-boring machine excavation project that helped with forecasting and managing the project timelines in response to the changes in the uncertain excavation environment. This project is presented as a test case and demonstrates encouraging results for integrative modelling of large-scale problems with elements of uncertainty.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "121", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "125", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "121 - 125"}, "authors": ["I.
