The construction industry has been slow to take up on RFID and this paper will discuss the merits of the technology in its potential for application within the construction sector. The paper reports about the prototypical implementation of RFID-based information management in FM-scenarios. The prototypes were tested at University College Cork (UCC). The general applicability of RFID for decentralised information management could be demonstrated.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "329", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "335", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "329 - 335"}, "authors": ["Karsten Menzel", "Zixiang Cong", "Luke Allan"], "keywords": ["Buildings", "Documentation", "Educational institutions", "Maintenance engineering", "Materials", "Radiofrequency identification", "Transponders", "RFID technology", "computer based maintenance of Infrastructure", "intelligent construction site", ""], "arnumber": "6073001"}
