Its applications into design education have been explored with a limitation to this entire area. TAR offers an innovative learning space by merging digital learning materials into the format of media with tools or objects which are direct parts of the physical space. It is therefore conceived that such combination opens new perspectives in teaching and learning. This paper presented and evaluated one TAR system to improve the pedagogical effectiveness of experiential and collaborative learning process in urban design education. The results from the experiments were analyzed under a previously developed theoretical framework, which show that TAR can enhance the design activities in some collaborative work.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "13", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "13 - 18"}, "authors": ["Rui Chen", "Xiangyu Wang"], "keywords": ["Augmented reality", "Computers", "Context", "Education", "Materials", "Testing", "Visualization", "augmented reality", "design learning", "physicality", "tangible augmented reality", "tangible interface", ""], "arnumber": "6072951"}
