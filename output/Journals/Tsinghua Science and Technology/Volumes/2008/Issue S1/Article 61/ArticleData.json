So-called ITplatforms often \u201cbuilt\u201d of an ad-hoc, inconsistent combination of off-the-shelf building management components, distributed data metering equipment and several monitoring software tools. A promising approach to achieve consistent, holistic performance data management is the implementation of an integrated, modular wireless sensor platform. This paper presents an approach of how wireless sensors can be seamlessly integrated into existing and future intelligent building management systems supporting improved building performance and diagnostics with an emphasis on energy management.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "381", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "386", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "381 - 386"}, "authors": ["Karsten Menzel", "Dirk Pesch", "Brendan O'Flynn", "Marcus Keane", "Cian O'Mathuna"], "keywords": ["Ad hoc networks", "Buildings", "Logic gates", "Network topology", "Protocols", "Wireless communication", "Wireless sensor networks", "computer based monitoring and maintenance of infrastructure", "energy efficient building", "wireless sensor platform", ""], "arnumber": "6073009"}
