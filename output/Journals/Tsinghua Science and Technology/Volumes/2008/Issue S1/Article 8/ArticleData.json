The complicated reversed internal paths involved in the nonlinear relationship which not only depend on material properties, but also on load history, often confuse rule creators and scholars. In this paper, we first describe the development of past hysteretic models. Then we introduce the FSM theory conceptually, and explain how it is applied to reversed and diverse routes. Next, state definitions and procedures are explained with a specific data example using the bilinear model. Finally, the successful application to UC-win/FRAME (3~) is described and several characteristics are summarized. By using FSM's states and the linkages to represent a hysteresis model, we can quickly realize the programming of the defined complex model rules, and the nonlinear modeling becomes more efficient and feasible.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "46", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "52", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "46 - 52"}, "authors": ["Deyin Jin", "Yuji Ito"], "keywords": ["Automata", "Computational modeling", "Computers", "Concrete", "Earthquakes", "Load modeling", "Programming", "constitutive laws", "earthquake responses", "finite state machine", "hysteretic relationships", "nonlinear simulation", "re versed routes", ""], "arnumber": "6072956"}
