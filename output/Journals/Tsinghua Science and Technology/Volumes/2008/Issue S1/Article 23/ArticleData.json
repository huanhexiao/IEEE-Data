Laser scanners are used more and more as surveying instruments for various applications because of their high-precision scanning abilities. For buildings, the most notable and widely accepted product data model is the IFC product data model. It is designed to cover the whole lifecycle and supported by various software vendors and enables applications to efficiently share and exchange project information. The models obtained with the laser scanner, normally sets of points (\u201cpoint cloud\u201d), have to be transferred to an IFC compatible building information model to serve the needs of different planning states. This paper presents an approach designed by the German Research Center in Karlsruhe (Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe) to create an IFC compatible building information model from laser range images. The methodology through the entire process from data acquisition to the IFC compatible product model was proposed in this paper. In addition, IFC-Models with different level of detail (LoDs) were introduced and discussed within the work.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "138", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "144", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "138 - 144"}, "authors": ["Shutao Li", "Jorg Isele", "Georg Bretthauer"], "keywords": ["Buildings", "Computational modeling", "Data models", "Face", "Laser modes", "Solid modeling", "Three dimensional displays", "building information model (BIM)", "industry foundation classes (IFC)", "laserscanning", "object rec ognition", "simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)", ""], "arnumber": "6072971"}
