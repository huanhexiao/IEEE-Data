JCCS is planned to be a Japanese IFD and developped on the technical basis of ISO 12006\u20132 and 12006\u20133. Japan has currently no such an IFD-like library of terminologies which is to be an essential tool for the multiple and harmonized information processing, so that JCCS should be a key technology for the successful CALS/EC. First, the development concepts and related technologies are described. Second, evaluation of the current situation of information process in the construction industry is clarified, and followed by the requirements of the development of JCCS. In the main part, the current version of JCCS is outlined, major contents of which are the basic architecture of JCCS, JCCS schema, JCCS basic tables and the usage of JCCS in practice. Finally, future develoment in plan is briefly explained.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "199", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "204", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "199 - 204"}, "authors": ["Tatsuo Terai"], "keywords": ["Buildings", "Databases", "Dictionaries", "Encoding", "Libraries", "Roads", "CALS/EC", "IFD", "classification", "concept definition", "information harmonization", "schema", ""], "arnumber": "6072980"}
