Data sharing and data service such as support of metadata deign, structuring of data contents, support of text mining are applied for better use of data as data interoperability. Semantic network dictionary and gazetteers are constructed as a trans-disciplinary dictionary. Ontological information is added to the system by digitalizing text based dictionaries, developing \u201cknowledge writing tool\u201d for experts, and extracting semantic relations from authoritative documents with natural language processing technique. The system is developed to collect lexicographic ontology and geographic ontology.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "336", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "342", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "336 - 342"}, "authors": ["Masahiko Naqai", "Masafumi Ono", "Ryosuke Shibasaki"], "keywords": ["Dictionaries", "Google", "Internet", "Meteorology", "Ontologies", "Reliability", "Semantics", "data integration", "gazetteer", "interoperability", "ontology", "semantic network dictionary", ""], "arnumber": "6073002"}
