Taking into account influential factors, e.g., resource, spatial condition, and the randomness of the construction process, the installation process of the steelstructure was simulated and optimized by using genetic algorithm (GA) optimization methodology. The operations simulation shortened the installation duration by 39 days (about 160/0 of the original total duration), guided the manufacturers to plan the construction processes, and provided specific suggestions on the entry time of the installation components, resulting in resource allocation optimization, resource saving, and construction efficiency improvement. Combining with the optimized schedule, the 40 visualization environment can discover time-space conflicts timely, and may assist project managers to reschedule the construction activities in tune with the site layout and resource allocation.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "241", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "247", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "241 - 247"}, "authors": ["Jianping Zhang", "Yang Zhang", "Zhenzhong Hu", "Ming Lu"], "keywords": ["Assembly", "Cranes", "Design automation", "Genetic algorithms", "Optimization", "Schedules", "Solid modeling", "40 computer aided design (CAD)", "genetic algorithm", "optimization", "con struction management", "simulation", "visualization", ""], "arnumber": "6072987"}
