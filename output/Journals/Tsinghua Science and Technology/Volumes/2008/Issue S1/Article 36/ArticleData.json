The unit consists of an ultra-small personal computer (PC), a global positioning system (GPS) receiver, an accelerometer and an ADC (Analog/Digital Converter) so that the unit can trace the route while capturing an acceleration response of a passenger vehicle. The unit enables more frequent and qualitative data acquisition compared with traditional and the state of the practice railway track inspection equipments. Locating disorder is the key of our unit, which has a reasonable accuracy of positioning with GPS data, existing facilities landmarks, and car acceleration responses. The proposed unit is a promising device for efficient properties management of railway agencies. The prototype implementation shows a result that car acceleration responses are related with the track displacements in low frequencies. The results also imply that sensor settlement on a vehicle floor, not axes or bogies, is effective for capturing track vertical displacements.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "223", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "227", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "223 - 227"}, "authors": ["Yusuke Mizuno", "Yozo Fujino", "Keita Kataoka", "Yoshihiro Matsumoto"], "keywords": ["Acceleration", "Accelerometers", "Global Positioning System", "Prototypes", "Rail transportation", "Sensors", "Vehicles", "data acquisition", "global positioning system (GPS)", "instrumentation", "mobile sensing", "passenger vehicle", "railway track monitoring", ""], "arnumber": "6072984"}
