The factorization phase is reduced into a series of interleaved element assembly and dense matrix operations for which the BLAS3 kernels are used. A similar approach is generalized for the forward and back substitution phases for the efficient solution of structures having multiple load conditions. The program performs all assembly and solution steps in parallel. Examples are presented which demonstrate the code's performance on single and dual core processor computers.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "34", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "39", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "34 - 39"}, "authors": ["Efe Guney", "Kenneth Will"], "keywords": ["Assembly", "Instruction sets", "Kernel", "Matrices", "Parallel processing", "Sparse matrices", "Symmetric matrices", "BLAS3", "Cholesky decomposition", "finite element method", "high performance computing", "multi-core programming", "multifrontal method", "parallel computing", ""], "arnumber": "6072954"}
