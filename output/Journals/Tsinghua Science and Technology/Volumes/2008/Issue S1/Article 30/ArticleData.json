It is focused on a formalized approach with the objective that effects of subsequent modifications are detected automatically. The approach presented in this paper makes use of an existing modeling technique specifically focused on construction processes. The modeling techniques result in a process description where all technological interdependencies between construction activities are considered and where consistency between the sequence of activities and the history of components is guaranteed. This modeling technique is expanded by an existing concept for handling versions and dependencies between objects. The integration of these different concepts makes it possible to track effects of relevant types of subsequent modifications in construction processes on a formalized basis. Effects of subsequent modifications are detected by algorithms, different versions can be compared by algorithms and different versions are stored so that subsequent modifications are documented. The innovation of the approach presented is the completeness. Effects of different relevant types of subsequent modifications in construction processes are tracked on a formalized basis.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "185", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "191", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "185 - 191"}, "authors": ["Wolfgang Huhnt", "Sven Richter", "Felix Enge"], "keywords": ["Availability", "Buildings", "Computational modeling", "Documentation", "History", "Manufacturing processes", "Planning", "construction processes", "process modeling", "subsequent modifications", ""], "arnumber": "6072978"}
