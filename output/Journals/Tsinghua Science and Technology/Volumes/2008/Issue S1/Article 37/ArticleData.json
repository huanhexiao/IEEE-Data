Bridge designs need a breakthrough in the current development limitations, and then become more intelligent and integrated. This paper proposes a new parametric and feature-based computer aided design (CAD) models which can represent families of bridge objects, includes knowledge representation, threedimensional geometric topology relationships. The realization of a family member is found by solving first the geometric constraints, and then the topological constraints. From the geometric solution, constraint equations are constructed. Topology solution is developed by feature dependencies graph between bridge objects. Finally, feature parameters are proposed to drive bridge design with feature parameters. Results from our implementation show that the method can help to facilitate bridge design.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "228", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "233", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "228 - 233"}, "authors": ["Weibing Peng", "Liangliang Song", "Guoshuai Pan"], "keywords": ["Bridges", "Equations", "Materials", "Mathematical model", "Skeleton", "Solid modeling", "Topology", "bridge intelligent design", "constraint equations", "feature dependence graph", "feature mapping", ""], "arnumber": "6072985"}
