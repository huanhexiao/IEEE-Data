We explore in this paper how an asynchronous ICT, called ThinkTank, reshaped the work practice of design-construction global teams, and how the interaction with this ICT reshaped the purpose and benefits of its use. ThinkTank is a web-based asynchronous collaboration and discussion forum. We introduce the influence diffusion model (10M) that formalizes the process of identifying the influence of people, messages, and terms mathematically. Discovering who the influence leaders in project teams are can be beneficial and critical from a corporate management perspective, since they can guide or motivate the team towards successful actions and outcomes. We present the ThinkTank-IDM integrated system and its validation with a testbed of 53 AEC global team project archived in ThinkTank over 8 years.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "145", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "150", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "145 - 150"}, "authors": ["Renate Fruchter", "Shubashri Swaminathan", "Naohiro Matsumura", "Yukio Ohsawa"], "keywords": ["Context", "Educational institutions", "Electronic mail", "Lead", "Teamwork", "asynchronous collaboration technology", "global teamwork", "influence leader", "influence topic", "interaction dynamics", ""], "arnumber": "6072972"}
