Initial findings suggest that Process Design Pattern may have the potential to intuitively support ICT based lean construction. We initiated a \u201cProcess Archeology\u201d in order to reveal the requirements for tools that can support the planning, simulation and control of lean construction methods. First findings show that existing tools provide only limited support and therefore, we started to develop new methodologies and technologies to overcome these shortcomings. Through the introduction of Process Design Patterns, we intent to establish process thinking in the interdisciplinary POP design. Optimized construction processes may be synthesized with semi-automatic methods by applying Process Design Patterns on building structures. By providing process templates that integrate problem solution and expert knowledge, Process Design Patterns may have the potential to ensure high quality process models.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "179", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "184", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "179 - 184"}, "authors": ["Manfred Breit", "Manfred Vogel", "Fritz H\u00e4ubi", "Fabian M\u00e4rki", "Micheal Raps"], "keywords": ["Buildings", "Object oriented modeling", "Planning", "Process design", "Software", "Solid modeling", "Three dimensional displays", "4D design", "lean construction methods", "process and organization modeling and simulation", "process design patterns", ""], "arnumber": "6072977"}
