It is currently used in practice on a wide range of civil, power, and building projects in the UK. The aim of this study is first to identify the tangible and intangible benefits of the system through a user survey; then to develop a framework to measure these benefits. A questionnaire survey is conducted, which reveals that CCM can help project teams improve process effectiveness, reduce risk of process failures, and increase the compliance with NEC requirements. Subsequently, a spreadsheet tool is developed to allow CCM users to calculate the tangible cost savings as a result of using the system. For intangible benefits, a change management maturity model (CM3) is developed, which provides a measurement framework for assessing the improvement of a project team's capability in dealing with contract changes.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "205", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "210", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "205 - 210"}, "authors": ["Ming Sun", "Tejas Oza"], "keywords": ["Capability maturity model", "Collaboration", "Contracts", "Organizations", "Process control", "Risk management", "IT benefit measurement", "benefit measurement framework", "capability maturity model", "contract change management", "new engineering contract (NEC) processes", ""], "arnumber": "6072981"}
