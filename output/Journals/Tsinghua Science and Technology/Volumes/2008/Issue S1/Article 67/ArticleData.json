According to existing fire statistics, the weighted fire risk calculating method characterized by the number of fire occurrence, direct economic losses, and fire casualties was put forward. On the basis of this method, meanwhile having improved K-mean clustering arithmetic, this paper established fire risk K-mean clustering model, which could better resolve the automatic classifying problems towards fire risk. Fire risk cluster should be classified by the absolute distance of the target instead of the relative distance in the traditional cluster arithmetic. Finally, for applying the established model, this paper carried out fire risk clustering on fire statistics from January 2000 to December 2004 of Shenyang in China. This research would provide technical support for urban fire management.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "418", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "422", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "418 - 422"}, "authors": ["Lizhi Wu", "Aizhu Ren"], "keywords": ["Clustering methods", "Economics", "Equations", "Fires", "Loss measurement", "Mathematical model", "K-mean clustering", "fire risk", "fire statistics", "urban fire", ""], "arnumber": "6073015"}
