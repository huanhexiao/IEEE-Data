To archive this purpose, the authors have analyzed current research and technical development for STEP and XML link and developed a prototype system for sharing information between model based drawings and XML based construction documents. Finally, the authors have suggested practical use scenario of sharing information through linked STEP and XML Lusing test case of automatic code checking. In the paper, the possibility of constructing integrated architectural computing environment through exchange and sharing of drawing information and external data for the whole building life-cycle, from the conceptual design stage to the construction and maintenance stage has been examined. Automated code checking through linked STEP and XML could be enhanced through collaboration business, more completed code, improved building performance, and reduced construction costs.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "171", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "178", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "171 - 178"}, "authors": ["Jungsik Choi", "Inhan Kim"], "keywords": ["Buildings", "Data mining", "Design automation", "Joining processes", "Solid modeling", "XML", "STEP", "XML", "architectural drawing information", "construction document information", "sharing and exchange", ""], "arnumber": "6072976"}
