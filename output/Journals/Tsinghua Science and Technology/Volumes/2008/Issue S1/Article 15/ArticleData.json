To account for the liquid influences on the dynamics between paired particles, this paper presents a wet soft-sphere contact model with liquidmodified parameters. The developed scheme takes full advantage of OEM and avoids the expensive simulation of the solid-liquid interactions with conventional Navier-Stokes equation solver. This wet contact model has been implemented in an in-housed parallel discrete objects simulation system \u2014 KNIGHT and ANNE/IRIS \u25fb to compute the dynamic behaviors of both dry and wet granular particles flowing down an inclined channel.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "90", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "95", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "90 - 95"}, "authors": ["Wei-Tze Tze Chang", "Shang-Hsien Hsieh", "Fu-Ling Yang", "Chuin-Shan Chen"], "keywords": ["Computational modeling", "Damping", "Force", "Friction", "Mathematical model", "Solid modeling", "Springs", "contact model", "discrete element method", "interaction model", "wet granular flow", ""], "arnumber": "6072963"}
