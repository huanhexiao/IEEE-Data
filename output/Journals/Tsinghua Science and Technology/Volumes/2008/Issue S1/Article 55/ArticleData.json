The position, speed, and track of moving targets such as humans and vehicles, which could be calculated by their locations at anytime in images basically, were required for management. The proposed algorithm, dependent on the context-sensitive moving information of image sequences which was much more than one or two images provided, compared the blobs' properties in current frame to the trajectories of targets in the previous frames and then corresponded them. The processing frame rate is about 10fps with the image 240-by-120 pixels. Experimental results show that position, direction, and speed measurements have an accuracy level compatible with the manual work. The user-define process makes the UDTTS available to the public whenever appropriate.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "343", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "347", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "343 - 347"}, "authors": ["Qiaonan Shen", "Xuehui An"], "keywords": ["Image color analysis", "Monitoring", "Streaming media", "Target tracking", "Trajectory", "Vehicles", "consecutive trajectory", "digital image processing", "target tracking system", "user defined", ""], "arnumber": "6073003"}
