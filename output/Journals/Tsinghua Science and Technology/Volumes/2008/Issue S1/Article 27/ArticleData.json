However, this is limited to the suite of models provided by the software vendor and consequently it forces all the parties to use the same software. In contrast, the research described in this paper investigates ways of using standard software applications, which may be specialized for different professional domains. These are linked for effective transfer of information and a binding mechanism is provided to support consistency. The proposed solution was implemented using a CAD application and an independent finite element application in order to verify the theoretical aspects of this work.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "165", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "170", "date_publication": "Oct. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "165 - 170"}, "authors": ["Albertus H.
