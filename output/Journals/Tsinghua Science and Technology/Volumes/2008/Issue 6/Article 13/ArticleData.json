Artificial intelligence techniques, the core of soft-computing, have numerous advantages over conventional fault diagnostic approaches; therefore, a soft-computing system was developed to detect and diagnose electric motor faults. The fault diagnostic system for three-phase induction motors samples the fault symptoms and then uses a fuzzy-expert forward inference model to identify the fault. This paper describes how to define the membership functions and fuzzy sets based on the fault symptoms and how to construct the hierarchical fuzzy inference nets with the propagation of probabilities concerning the uncertainty of faults. The designed hierarchical fuzzy inference nets efficiently detect and diagnose the fault type and exact location in a three phase induction motor. The validity and effectiveness of this approach is clearly shown from obtained testing results.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "817", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "822", "date_publication": "Dec. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "817 - 822"}, "authors": ["Mingchui Dong", "Takson Cheang", "Devi Sekar Booma", "Sileong Chan"], "keywords": ["Bars", "Circuit faults", "Fuzzy sets", "Induction motors", "Probability", "Rotors", "Stators", "fuzzy sets", "inference nets", "likelihood of necessity (LN)", "likelihood of sufficiency (LS)", "membership function", "propagation of probabilities", "uncertainty", ""], "arnumber": "6073032"}
