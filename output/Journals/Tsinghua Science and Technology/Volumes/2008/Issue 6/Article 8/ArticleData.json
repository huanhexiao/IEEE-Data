The method transforms the mixed filtering and down-sampling stages to separate cascade filtering and sampling stages to determine the unfolded frequency response which shows the anti-aliasing ability of the mixer. The transformation can also be applied to other mixed signal and multi-rate receiver systems to analyze their unfolded frequency responses. The transformed system architecture was used to calculate the unfolded frequency response of the multi-tap direct sampling mixer and compared with the mixer model without noise in the advanced design system 2005A environment to further evaluate the frequency response. The simulations show that the \u22123 dB bandwidth is 3.0 MHz and the voltage gain is attenuated by 1.5 dB within a 1-MHz baseband bandwidth.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "790", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "795", "date_publication": "Dec. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "790 - 795"}, "authors": ["Yun Pan", "Ning Ge", "Zaiwang Dong"], "keywords": ["Frequency response", "IIR filters", "Mathematical model", "Mixers", "Radio frequency", "Transforms", "decimation", "integral sampling", "multi-tap direct sampling mixer", "transformation", "unfolded frequency response", ""], "arnumber": "6073027"}
