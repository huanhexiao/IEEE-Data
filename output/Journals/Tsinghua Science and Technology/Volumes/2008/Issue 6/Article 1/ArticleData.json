An enhanced distributed channel access analytical model is used to compute the maximum number of admitted users according to the QoS requirements and the packet arrival characters. Then, some channel resources are reserved for handoff calls based on the maximum number of admitted users and the call-level traffic model. The channel utilization ratio is also measured to reflect the current system traffic load. The maximum number of admitted users and the channel utilization ratio are used for admission control for applications with QoS requirements in the call level and for rate control of best effort applications in the packet level using the p-nonacknowledgement scheme. Thus, the QoS requirements are statistically guaranteed while the system is efficiently utilized. Simulations validate the effectiveness of this mechanism to guarantee the QoS and bandwidth utilization.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "741", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "746", "date_publication": "Dec. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "741 - 746"}, "authors": ["Zhisheng Niu", "Jing Liu"], "keywords": ["Admission control", "Bandwidth", "Delay", "IEEE 802.11e Standard", "Telecommunication traffic", "Wireless LAN", "admission control", "enhanced distributed channel access", "quality of service", "rate control", "wireless local area network", ""], "arnumber": "6073020"}
