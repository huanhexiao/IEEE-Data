An efficient method was developed to optimize the interpulse frequency modulation to remove most of the ACF sidelobes about the mainlobe peak, with only a small increase in the mainlobe width. The genetic algorithm is used to solve the nonlinear optimization problem to find the interpulse frequency modulation sequence. The effects on the ACF sidelobes suppression and mainlobe widening are studied. The results show that the new design is superior to the corresponding stepped-frequency LFM signal and weighted stepped-frequency LFM signal in the terms of the ACF sidelobes reduction and mainlobe spread.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "800", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "806", "date_publication": "Dec. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "800 - 806"}, "authors": ["Peng Wang", "Huadong Meng", "Wang Xiqin"], "keywords": ["Bandwidth", "Biological cells", "Correlation", "Frequency modulation", "Genetic algorithms", "Optimization", "Radar", "autocorrelation function (ACF)", "coherent train", "genetic algorithm (GA)", "performance improvement", "sidelobes suppression", ""], "arnumber": "6073029"}
