This paper presents an improved register allocation algorithm that improves the testability called weighted graph-based balanced register allocation for high-level circuit synthesis. The controllability and observability of the registers and the self-loop elimination are analyzed to form a weighted conflict graph, where the weight of the edge between two nodes denotes the tendency of the two variables to share the same register. Then the modified desaturation algorithm is used to dynamically modify the weights to obtain a final balanced register allocation which improves the testability of the synthesized circuits. Tests on some benchmarks show that the algorithm gives a higher fault coverage than other algorithms with less area overhead and even less time delay.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "836", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "842", "date_publication": "Dec. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "836 - 842"}, "authors": ["Benmao Cheng", "Hong Wang", "Shiyuan Yang", "Daoheng Niu", "Yang Jin"], "keywords": ["Circuit synthesis", "Color", "Controllability", "Electrocardiography", "Heuristic algorithms", "Registers", "Resource management", "high-level synthesis (HLS)", "register allocation", "testability", "weighted graph", ""], "arnumber": "6073035"}
