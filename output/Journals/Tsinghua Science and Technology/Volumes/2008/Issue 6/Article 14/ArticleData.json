Traditionally, many computations are repeated to seek the proper power system settings such that the UFLS provides the desired good performance for selected scenarios. An adaptive UFLS method based on the genetic algorithm was developed to automate the finding of optimal parameters to minimize the repetitive trial-error calculations. Simulations demonstrate that the method has better performance than previous schemes and reduces the time and effort of the repetitive simulations.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "823", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "828", "date_publication": "Dec. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "823 - 828"}, "authors": ["Mingchui Dong", "Chinwang Lou", "Chikong Wong"], "keywords": ["Computational modeling", "Genetic algorithms", "Load modeling", "Optimization", "Power system stability", "Suspensions", "Time frequency analysis", "adaptive load shedding", "genetic algorithm", "under-frequency load shedding", ""], "arnumber": "6073033"}
