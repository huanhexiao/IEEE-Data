This paper describes a robust principal components analysis (RPCA)-based abnormal traffic flow pattern isolation and loop detector fault detection method. The results show that RPCA is a useful tool to distinguish regular traffic flow from abnormal traffic flow patterns caused by accidents and loop detector faults. This approach gives an effective traffic flow data pre-processing method to reduce the human effort in finding potential loop detector faults. The method can also be used to further investigate the causes of the abnormality.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "829", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "835", "date_publication": "Dec. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "829 - 835"}, "authors": ["Xuexiang Jin", "Yi Zhang", "Li Li", "Jianming Hu"], "keywords": ["Accidents", "Covariance matrix", "Detectors", "Electric breakdown", "Principal component analysis", "Robustness", "Vectors", "loop detector faults", "robust principal components analysis (RPCA)", "traffic flow pattern", ""], "arnumber": "6073034"}
