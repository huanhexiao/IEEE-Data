A performance analysis of the outage probability and the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff for the scheme shows that the forwarding mechanism efficiently reduces fading in wireless channels by achieving full diversity order of magnitude improvement. A considerable signal-to-noise ratio gain is provided by this scheme compared with existing cooperation schemes with fixed forwarding. This flexible forwarding mechanism enables the scheme to provide the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff performance.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "778", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "783", "date_publication": "Dec. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "778 - 783"}, "authors": ["Cong Peng", "Ming Zhao", "Yan Yao"], "keywords": ["Fading", "Performance analysis", "Probability", "Protocols", "Relays", "Signal to noise ratio", "Wireless communication", "cooperative communication", "diversity-multiplexing tradeoff", "hybrid forwarding", "outage probability", ""], "arnumber": "6073025"}
