The purpose is to check the feasibility of using time-domain synchronous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (TDS-OFDM) technology in powerline communication (PLC). TDS-OFDM is the core technology in digital multimedia broadcasting-terrestrial (DMB-T), developed by Tsinghua University for digital television terrestrial multimedia broadcast applications and successfully adopted in the Chinese Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting Standard. PLC systems are widely believed to be bandwidth or data throughput limited. However, the use of known pseudo random sequences as guard intervals for synchronization and channel estimation in TDS-OFDM greatly reduces the system overhead and increases the spectrum efficiency. These experiments show that TDS-OFDM is appropriate not only for broadcasting but also for PLC applications with appropriate modifications.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "784", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "789", "date_publication": "Dec. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "784 - 789"}, "authors": ["Jian Song", "Qing Wu", "Changyong Pan", "Zhixing Yang", "Liu Haitao", "Zhao Bingzhen", "Li Xiao"], "keywords": ["Medium voltage", "Modulation", "Multimedia communication", "Noise", "OFDM", "Power cables", "Transceivers", "digital multimedia broadcasting-terrestrial (DMB-T)", "powerline communications (PLC)", "time-domain synchronous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (TDS-OFDM)", ""], "arnumber": "6073026"}
