This paper describes the uplink of a power-controlled circular-layout DAS (CL-DAS) with minimum mean-square error (MMSE) receivers. Results from random matrix theory are used to show that for such a DAS, the per-user sum rate and the total transmit power both converge as the number of users and antennas goes to infinity with a constant ratio of antennas to users. The relationship between the asymptotic per-user sum rate and the asymptotic total transmit power is given for all possible values of the radius of the circle on which antennas are placed. This rate-power relationship is then used to find the optimal radius. With this optimal radius, the CL-DAS is proved to offer a significant gain compared with a traditional co-located antenna system. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the analysis and the superiority of the DAS.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "759", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "768", "date_publication": "Dec. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "759 - 768"}, "authors": ["Jiansong Gan", "Yunzhou Li", "Shidong Zhou", "Jing Wang"], "keywords": ["Antenna arrays", "Fading", "Power demand", "Random variables", "Receivers", "Transmitting antennas", "distributed antenna system (DAS)", "minimum mean-square error (MMSE)", "power consumption", "random matrix theory", "sum rate", ""], "arnumber": "6073023"}
