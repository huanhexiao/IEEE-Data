The key features of AGC, including a steady state output and static/dynamic timing response, depend mainly on key parameters such as the reference and the filter coefficients. A simple model developed to describe AGC systems based on several simple assumptions shows that AGC always converges to the reference and that the timing constant depends on the filter coefficients. Measures are given to prevent oscillations and limit cycle effects. The simple AGC system is adapted to a multiple AGC system for a TV tuner in a much more efficient model. Simulations using the C language are 16 times faster than those with MATLAB, and 10 times faster than those with a mixed register transfer level (RTL)-simulation program with integrated circuit emphasis (SPICE) model.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "807", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "811", "date_publication": "Dec. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "807 - 811"}, "authors": ["Jingdian Wang", "Xiuhong Lu", "Li Zhang"], "keywords": ["Automatic generation control", "Detectors", "Gain control", "Integrated circuit modeling", "Mathematical model", "TV", "Transfer functions", "digital automatic gain control", "limit cycle effect", "loop filter", "oscillations", "power detection", ""], "arnumber": "6073030"}
