Unlike the existing serial FIFOs based on asynchronous micropipelines, this FIFO's cells communicate directly with the input and output ports through a common bus, which effectively eliminates the data movement from the input port to the output port, thereby reducing the latency and the power consumption. Furthermore, the latency does not increase with the number of FIFO stages. Single-track asynchronous protocols are used to simplify the FIFO controller design, with only three C-gates needed in each cell controller, which substantially reduces the area. Simulations with the TSMC 0.25 \u03bcm CMOS logic process show that the latency of the 4-stage FIFO is less than 581 ps and the throughput is higher than 2.2 GHz.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "812", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "816", "date_publication": "Dec. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "812 - 816"}, "authors": ["Yong Xiao", "Runde Zhou"], "keywords": ["Asynchronous circuits", "Computer architecture", "Delay", "Logic gates", "Microprocessors", "Protocols", "Synchronization", "asynchronous circuit", "asynchronous first in first out (FIFO)", "circular", "global asynchronous local synchronous (GALS)", "systems on a chip (SOC)", ""], "arnumber": "6073031"}
