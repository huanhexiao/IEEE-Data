The W-shaped flow consists of two sequential V-shaped optimization flows. The first V-shaped flow optimizes the global routing solution. The probabilistic congestion prediction technique is used to guide the global routing decision to find the routing solution that evenly distributes the nets. Then, the second V-shaped flow improves the quality of the routing result. Tests on a set of commonly used benchmark circuits and comparisons with other multilevel routing systems show that the routability, total wire length, total number of vias, and the runtime are all improved.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "843", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "849", "date_publication": "Dec. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "843 - 849"}, "authors": ["Hailong Yao", "Yici Cai", "Xianlong Hong"], "keywords": ["Heuristic algorithms", "Probabilistic logic", "Refining", "Routing", "congestion", "full-chip routing", "multilevel routing", "physical design", ""], "arnumber": "6073036"}
