This paper presents a normalized PI algorithm that traces the stochastic characteristics of the interference. The algorithm adaptively adjusts the recursive step size to determine the constrained optimized parameters for the lowpass filter. Simulations show that the normalized PI algorithm achieves faster convergence and produces deeper nulls. The algorithm makes GPS receivers more robust in environments with large variations in the interference strength.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "796", "volume": "13", "lastpage": "799", "date_publication": "Dec. 2008", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2008", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "796 - 799"}, "authors": ["Dawei Meng", "Zhenming Feng", "Mingquan Lu"], "keywords": ["Adaptive arrays", "Array signal processing", "Global Positioning System", "Interference", "Jamming", "Vectors", "GPS", "antenna arrays", "anti-jamming", "normalized power inversion", ""], "arnumber": "6073028"}
