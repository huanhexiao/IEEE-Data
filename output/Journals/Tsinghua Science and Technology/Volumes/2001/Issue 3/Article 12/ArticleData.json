They include analysis of the inter-subunit electrostatic repulsion for determining partners for dimerization and of the buried polar interaction for determining the relative orientation of the partners. A theory is proposed to explain the lack of antiparallel coiled coil homodimers in nature.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "253", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "256", "date_publication": "Aug. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "253 - 256"}, "authors": ["Xian'gang Zeng", "Haimeng Zhou"], "keywords": ["Coils", "Educational institutions", "Electrostatics", "Peptides", "Proteins", "Stability analysis", "antiparallel orientation", "coiled coil", "dimer", "electrostatic repulsion", "hydrogen bond", ""], "arnumber": "6083395"}
