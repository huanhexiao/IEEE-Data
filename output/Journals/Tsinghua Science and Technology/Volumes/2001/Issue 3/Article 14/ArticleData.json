In addition, the V3 loop on gp120 was identified as the principal neutralizing determinant (PND). Based on the fact that a combination of several monoclonal antibodies to different neutralizing epitopes showed great protection against intravenous challenge and vaginal transmission of pathogenic HIV-I/Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) chimeric virus on macaques, three candidate peptide-vaccines were prepared and used in combination to induce high levels of multiantibodies against HIV-1. The three peptides contained important functional regions on HIV-1 gp160. The N-domain peptide (PI: aa550\u2013579) and C-domain peptide (P2: aa633\u2013662) of gp41 and V3 peptide (P3: aa301\u2013328) of gp120 were conjugated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) using the glutaraldehyde method. After the vaccination course, each of the three candidate peptide-vaccines induced strong antibody response in rabbits. The three vaccines used in combination induced high levels of multiantibodies against the peptides of the N- and C-domains and the V3 loop, with the titer of antibodies up to 1: 6400\u20131: 25 600 in rabbit sera in comparison with the titer of 1: 800\u20131: 3200 induced by rgp41 or rgpl60. Our results indicate that immunogenicities of the N- and C-domains and the V3 loop in these three candidate peptide-vaccines were clearly stronger than those induced by rgp41 or rgpl60, and these peptide-vaccines used in combination synchronously induced high levels of multiantibodies against HIV-l, suggesting that used in combination they may provide a new vaccine-strategy to induce strong multi-antiviral activity.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "260", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "264", "date_publication": "Aug. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "260 - 264"}, "authors": ["Ying Wang", "Haijun Tian", "Li Qin", "Mei Zhu", "Yinghua Chen"], "keywords": ["Human immunodeficiency virus", "Humans", "Immune system", "Peptides", "Proteins", "Rabbits", "Vaccines", "combination", "human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-l)", "immunogenicity", "peptide-vaccine", ""], "arnumber": "6083397"}
