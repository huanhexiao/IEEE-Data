However, the alcohol production process needs to overcome three major challenges including increasing the productivity of alcohol fermentation, lowering the energy consumption for alcohol conversion and decreasing the environmental pollution caused by the alcoholic yeast fermentation process. To meet these challenges, a screening process was conducted using 13 high osmotic tolerant yeast strains. Among the strains, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain 1912 was found to produce high alcohol concentrations during fermentation with high starting molasses concentrations such as 50% (WIV) molasses. In the test, 13.6% (V IV) alcohol was produced in the molasses fermentation broth after 72 h of incubation with an initial Yunnan molasses concentration of 50% in a 5 L fermentor. 15. 0% (V IV) alcohol was obtained after 48 h of fermentation in shaking flasks containing 30% (WIV) initial total sugar concentration in diluted molasses. The performance of this strain in the shaking flasks was successfully scaled up to a 5-L fermentor vessel. Strain 1912 seems to be a better alcohol producer than the currently used alcohol production strain 2. 1190.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "225", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "230", "date_publication": "Aug. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "225 - 230"}, "authors": ["Yansong Gu", "Min Qiao", "Quan Zhou", "Zhengmao Zhou", "Guoqiang Chen"], "keywords": ["Alcoholic beverages", "Heating", "Productivity", "Strain", "Sugar", "Sugar industry", "Saccharomyces cerevisiae", "alcohol fermentation", "molasses", ""], "arnumber": "6083390"}
