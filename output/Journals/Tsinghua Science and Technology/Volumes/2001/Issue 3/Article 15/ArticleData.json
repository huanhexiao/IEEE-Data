Previous studies suggested that this gene is involved in vertebrate somitogenesis. In this study, the genomic DNA of terra locus was isolated and its organization was investigated. The analysis showed that terra locus consists of 3 introns and occupies 3154 bp in the genome of zebrafish. The exon-intron junctions of the second and third introns conform to the GT-AG rule, while the first intron has the unusual junction sequences of GT-AC. An IPTG-inducible expression system was established to produce terra protein in bacterial cells. Overexpression of terra protein leads to the formation of inclusion bodies in the bacterial cells. The protein will be used to study its structure and function.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "265", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "268", "date_publication": "Aug. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "265 - 268"}, "authors": ["Zhixing Zhao", "Zhengchun Hua", "Anming Meng"], "keywords": ["Bioinformatics", "Cloning", "DNA", "Genomics", "Junctions", "Microorganisms", "Proteins", "bacterial cells", "exon", "expression", "intron", "terra", "zebrafish", ""], "arnumber": "6083398"}
