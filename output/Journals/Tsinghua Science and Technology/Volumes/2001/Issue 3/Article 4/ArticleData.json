In order to define the production of GnRH as well as GnRH-R in the pancreatic gland, we examined their gene expression in various developmental stages of rat pancreas using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). GnRH mRNA transcripts were found in pancreas of male and female rats at different ages, expressing at about the same level, whereas GnRH-R mRNA transcripts could not be detected in any rat pancreatic gland samples. These results suggest a possible biological role of GnRH in rodent pancreas.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "212", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "215", "date_publication": "Aug. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "212 - 215"}, "authors": ["Lei Wang", "Liping Xie", "Weiquan Huang", "Rongqing Zhang"], "keywords": ["Biochemistry", "DNA", "Gene expression", "Glands", "Humans", "Pancreas", "RNA", "gene expression", "gonadotrophin-releasing hormone", "gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptor", "mRNA", "pancreas", "reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)", ""], "arnumber": "6083387"}
