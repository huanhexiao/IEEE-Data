The results showed that SCE caused a decline in CAM blood vessels and significantly prevented collagenase-induced collagenolysis. Moreover, SCE produced a dose-dependent decline in ECV-304 proliferation and altered its normal cell cycle. These results suggest that the anti-angiogenesis and anti-tumor effects of shark cartilage may be due to inhibition of endothelial cells as well as collagenolysis.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "200", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "205", "date_publication": "Aug. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "200 - 205"}, "authors": ["Fengl Wang", "Yitao Wang", "Liping Xie", "Rongqing Zhang"], "keywords": ["Absorption", "Blood vessels", "Cancer", "Computer aided manufacturing", "Humans", "Substrates", "Tumors", "angiogenesis", "chorioallantoic membrane", "collagenase", "endothelial cell", "shark cartilage extract", ""], "arnumber": "6083385"}
