The hydrophilicity and biocompatibility were studied with two kinds of enzymes, amylase BAN480L and lipase Novozym 388. The degree of hydrophilicity was observed using contact angle measurements. In vitro biocompatibility evaluations were carried out by direct incubation of mouse fibroblast cell line L929 on the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) films. The samples treated with BAN480L showed of the PHA biocompatibility increased while the hydrophilicity decreased. Relative to untreated samples, the number of cells on the Novozym 388 modified PHBHHx significant decrease as the hydrophilicity also decreased. The results indicated that other surface characteristics besides hydrophilicity influence the biocompatibility of PHBHHx films.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "216", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "221", "date_publication": "Aug. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "216 - 221"}, "authors": ["Xianshuang Yang", "Kai Zhao", "Caihong Xia", "Jinchun Chen", "Guoqiang Chen"], "keywords": ["Biochemistry", "Films", "In vitro", "Polymers", "Scanning electron microscopy", "Surface treatment", "biocompatibility", "hydrophilicity", "polyhydroxybutyrate-co-hexanoate (PHBHHx)", ""], "arnumber": "6083388"}
