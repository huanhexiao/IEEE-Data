During the differentiation and apoptosis, the HL60 cells undergo some conformational changes. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) was employed to detect those changes. The results showed that the contents of DNA/protein and glycoprotein/protein increased. The \u03b1-helix of the membrane protein also increased. In addition, the C-O (H) stretching mode of serine, threonine and tyrosine residues of the cell proteins also changed. Those conformational changes suggest some mechanisms for how genistein affects the HL60 cells.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "243", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "247", "date_publication": "Aug. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "243 - 247"}, "authors": ["Zhao Wang", "Jiangbing Zhou", "Suqin Sun", "Mingjie Liu", "Hongjun Zhang"], "keywords": ["Biomembranes", "Cells (biology)", "DNA", "Educational institutions", "Humans", "Proteins", "Spectroscopy", "HL60", "conformational change", "differentiation", "genistein", ""], "arnumber": "6083393"}
