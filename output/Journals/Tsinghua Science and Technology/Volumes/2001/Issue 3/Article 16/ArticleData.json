The chip based microreactor has integrated resistive heating elements. The computer-controlled temperature control system is highly reliable with precise temperature control, excellent temperature uniformity, and rapid heating and cooling capabilities. The development of the microreaction system is an important step towards the construction of a lab-on-a-chip system.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "269", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "272", "date_publication": "Aug. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "269 - 272"}, "authors": ["Gaoshan Jing", "Jian Zhang", "Xiaoshan Zhu", "Jihong Feng", "Zhimin Tan", "Litian Liu", "Jing Cheng"], "keywords": ["Glass", "Heating", "Silicon", "Temperature", "Temperature measurement", "Temperature sensors", "microchip", "microreactor", "polymerase chain reactions (PCR)", "temperature control", ""], "arnumber": "6083399"}
