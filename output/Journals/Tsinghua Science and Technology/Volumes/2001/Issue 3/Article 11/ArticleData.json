They are widely distributed and are implicated in diverse intracellular and extracellular physiological processes. A study of the S100 family using computational biology methods such as multiple sequence alignment, structural alignment and the construction of an evolutionary tree will promote understanding of S100 protein structures and their function, and could provide suggestions for crystallization.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "248", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "252", "date_publication": "Aug. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "248 - 252"}, "authors": ["Yu Wang", "Shenq Ye", "Ge Ruan", "M.
