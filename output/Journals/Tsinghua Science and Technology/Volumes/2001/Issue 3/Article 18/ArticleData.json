The flow speed could be precisely adjusted by a micropump, and the flow direction could be controlled by switching valves. The complete operation was computer-controlled. The control system for the micropump and microvalves is discussed here. This control system can be combined with other biochip devices to construct a micro total analysis system (\u03bcTAS).", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "277", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "280", "date_publication": "Aug. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "277 - 280"}, "authors": ["Jian Zhang", "Gaoshan Jing", "Junquan Xu", "Jing Cheng", "Yuxiang Zhou"], "keywords": ["Blood", "Data acquisition", "Dielectrophoresis", "Microfluidics", "Pumps", "Valves", "micro total analysis system (&#x03BC", "TAS)", "microfluidics", "micropump", "microvalve", ""], "arnumber": "6083401"}
