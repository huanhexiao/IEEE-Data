The base station is divided into four components according to their functions: antenna, IF, baseband, and control, which are connected by the ATM network. Virtualization provides great benefits such as fast handoff and easy realization of different macrodiversity algorithms. Macrodiversity can not be easily realized in conventional cellular systems. An exact analysis is presented for the performance of maximal ratio combining (MRC) macrodiversity in virtualized wireless communication systems. The results show that compared with soft handoff in COMA systems, MRC can greatly increase the reverse link capacity.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "45", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "48", "date_publication": "March 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "45 - 48"}, "authors": ["Jibing Wang", "Ming Zhao", "Shidong Zhou", "Yan Yao"], "keywords": ["Antennas", "Base stations", "Baseband", "Diversity reception", "Fading", "Multiaccess communication", "Wireless communication", "CDMA", "capacity", "maximal ratio combining (MRC) macrodiversity", "virtualization of wireless communication systems", ""], "arnumber": "6083370"}
