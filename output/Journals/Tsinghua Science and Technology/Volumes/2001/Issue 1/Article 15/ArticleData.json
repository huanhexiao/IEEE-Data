The network model was used to study the system identification, modeling and optimal control of the process. The Fuzzy Neural Network (FNN) has the advantages of multiple hidden layers, multiple neurons in each hidden layer, strong approximation ability and a quick convergence rate. Moreover, differential equations can be used to relate the input variables to the output variables, which facilitates the optimization. Fuzzy neural networks are useful for system identification and modeling of complex non-linear production processes.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "71", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "74", "date_publication": "March 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "71 - 74"}, "authors": ["Mingqin Feng", "Zhengshun Sun"], "keywords": ["Correlation", "FCC", "Fuzzy control", "Fuzzy neural networks", "Optimization", "System identification", "Vectors", "Fluidized Catalytic Cracking (FCC)", "Fuzzy Neural Network (FNN)", "system identification modeling", ""], "arnumber": "6083375"}
