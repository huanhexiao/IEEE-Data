This paper presents an approach that includes the effect of circuit capacity. Reliability evaluation of distribution systems with parallel circuits generally requires load flow solutions. The proposed approach combines the Z-matrix contingency method with DC load flow for a much faster direct solution. Three different methods for distribution system reliability evaluation have been incorporated into a computer program. The program was validated using two distribution systems connected to the IEEE-RTS and another sample distribution system.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "67", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "70", "date_publication": "March 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "67 - 70"}, "authors": ["Emmanuel Kwa-kofi", "Yongji Guo"], "keywords": ["Computers", "Educational institutions", "Impedance", "Indexes", "Integrated circuit reliability", "Load flow", "distribution system", "partial loss of continuity", "reliability evaluation", "total loss of continuity", ""], "arnumber": "6083374"}
