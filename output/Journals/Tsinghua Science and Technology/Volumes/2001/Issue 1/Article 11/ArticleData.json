This paper presents a Systems-Science-Based Knowledge Model (SSBKM) to establish a more general knowledge structure model. It can be regarded as a development of frame representation for discovering and constructing slot structures as well as the frame structures. With this model the paper also presents a System-Sciences-Based Object-Oriented Analysis method (SSBOOA), which is a strategy to find and determine object classes and class structures, the relations between object instances of different classes, not to just explain classes. Finally, the paper illustrates knowledge analysis and computerizing (synthesizing) steps in an example of SSBKM of cognitive psychology-based CAI Network for Teaching Middle School Mathematics.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "49", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "56", "date_publication": "March 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "49 - 56"}, "authors": ["Yingchun Li"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Computational modeling", "Educational institutions", "Materials", "Mathematical model", "Object oriented modeling", "Systems-Science-Based Knowledge Model (SSBKM)", "Systems-Science-Based Object-Oriented Analysis (SSBOOA)", "knowledge unit", "structure of units of knowledge", ""], "arnumber": "6083371"}
