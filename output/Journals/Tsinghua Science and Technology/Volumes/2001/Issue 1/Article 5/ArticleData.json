But difficulties are still encountered when these methods are applied to the CIM system design and implementation. This paper proposes a new integrated enterprise modeling methodology based on the workflow model. The system architecture and the integrated modeling environment are described with a new simulation strategy. The modeling process and the relationship between the workflow model and the views are discussed.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "24", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "March 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "24 - 28"}, "authors": ["Huiping Lin", "Yushun Fan", "Cheng Wu"], "keywords": ["Architecture", "Computational modeling", "Computer architecture", "Computer integrated manufacturing", "Data models", "Organizations", "System analysis and design", "CIM", "integrated modeling", "mapping", "simulation", "workflow", ""], "arnumber": "6083365"}
