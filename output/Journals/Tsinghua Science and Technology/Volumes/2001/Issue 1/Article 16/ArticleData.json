The steam generator SG in the HTR-10 is one of the most important components for reactor safety. The thermal-hydraulic performance of the SG was investigated. A full scale HTR-10 Steam Generator Two Tube Engineering Model Test Facility \u2022 SGTM-10 was installed and tested at INET. This paper describes the SGTM-10 thermal hydraulic experimental system in detail. The SGTM-10 simulates the actual thermal and structural parameters of the HTR-10. The SGTM-10 includes three separated loops the primary helium loop the secondary water loop and the tertiary cooling water loop. Two parallel tubes are arranged in the test assembly. The main experimental equipment is shown in the paper. Expermental results are given illustrating the effects of the outlet pressures the heating power and the inlet subcooling.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "75", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "79", "date_publication": "March 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "75 - 79"}, "authors": ["Huaiming Ju", "Kaifen Zuo", "Zhiyong Liu", "Yuanhui Xu"], "keywords": ["Electron tubes", "Generators", "Helium", "Resistance heating", "Temperature measurement", "Thermal stability", "Water heating", "helical tube steam generator", "high temperature gas cooled reactor", "once-through steam generator", "two phase flow stability", ""], "arnumber": "6083376"}
