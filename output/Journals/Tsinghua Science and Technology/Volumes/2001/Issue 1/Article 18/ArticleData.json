Such shutdowns have often occurred in the past in commercial nuclear power plants. Nuclear power plant authorities try to avoid such unplanned plant shutdowns because of the large economic loss. Unfortunately, it is difficult to identify all the important components from the numerous components in each complex nuclear power plant system. FMEA and FTA methods, which are often applied to probabilistic risk assessments, are used in this paper to identify the key components that may cause unplanned reactor trips. As an example, the 48 V DC power supply system in a typical Chinese nuclear power plant, which is a major cause of many unplanned reactor trips, was analyzed to show how to identify these key components and the causes for nuclear power plant trips.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "84", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "88", "date_publication": "March 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "84 - 88"}, "authors": ["Junli Li", "Jiejuan Tong", "Dingyuan Mao"], "keywords": ["Electromagnetics", "Inductors", "Power supplies", "Relays", "Turbines", "Valves", "Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA)", "Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)", "Nuclear Power Plant (NPP)", "Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA)", ""], "arnumber": "6083378"}
