The rupture of the coolant penetrating tube is a typical accident causing coolant loss. When the water level drops down to the upper edge of the inlet of the heat exchanger, the natural circulation stops. This influences the core cooling and the stability of the main loop. A series of tests showed that there is a stable drop of pressure, and the heated element temperature is not too high to cause burnout. But the backward flow or flow oscillation in the primary coolant circuit occurs when the flow breaks completely in the end. The whole flow process is described and the mechanism is discussed.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "89", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "92", "date_publication": "March 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "89 - 92"}, "authors": ["Jinhai Bo", "Youjie Zhang", "Shengyao Jiang"], "keywords": ["Accidents", "Coolants", "Heat transfer", "Inductors", "Oscillators", "Water heating", "Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA)", "Nuclear Heating Reactor (NHR)", "natural circulation", "safety", "stability", ""], "arnumber": "6083379"}
