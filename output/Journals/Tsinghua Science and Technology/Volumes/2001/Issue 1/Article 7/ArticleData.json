The system design is based on the careful analysis and evaluation of a traditional voting system, the computer controlled and managed voting system. The new system integrates technologies such as image processing, networking and databases to enhance three aspects of system performance: data collection, data transfer, and data management. Experiments have proved that the performance of the network-based voting system is superior to the CCMVS.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "34", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "37", "date_publication": "March 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "34 - 37"}, "authors": ["Huan Zhang", "Jingxin Tang"], "keywords": ["Computers", "Hardware", "Optoelectronic devices", "Protocols", "Reliability", "Servers", "Software", "Client/Server", "network", "voting system", ""], "arnumber": "6083367"}
