A new approach is proposed to implement synchronous demultiplexers in high-speed ISDN switching networks. A synchronous demultiplexer is designed utilizing the same structure as a synchronous shuffle multiplexer. Both the theoretical analysis and experimental results show that for the same capacity the new methodis more tolerant of signal delay variation so a very high-speed synchronous demultiplexer can be designed with the larger capacity required in large capacity synchronous switching networks.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "10", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "13", "date_publication": "March 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "10 - 13"}, "authors": ["Hangjun Ye", "Bin Liu"], "keywords": ["Delay", "Logic circuits", "Logic functions", "Multiplexing", "Shift registers", "Switches", "Synchronization", "SSN", "synchronous demultiplexer", "synchronous switching network", "synchrorous shuffle multiplexer", ""], "arnumber": "6083362"}
