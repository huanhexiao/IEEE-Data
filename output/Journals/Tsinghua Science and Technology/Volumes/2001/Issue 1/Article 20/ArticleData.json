The paper defines general N-th degree stochastic dominance, presents a sufficient and necessary condition which is the equivalent theorem of general N-th degree stochastic dominance. The feasible utility form is constructed to explain the economic meaning of N-th degree stochastic dominance in the field of financial economics. The equivalent condition is described by the probability distribution functions of risky assets, which are not related to utility functions (preference relations).", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "93", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "96", "date_publication": "March 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "93 - 96"}, "authors": ["Shunming Zhang"], "keywords": ["Economics", "Educational institutions", "Finance", "Investments", "Portfolios", "Random variables", "Sufficient conditions", "preference relation", "stochastic dominance", "utility function", ""], "arnumber": "6083380"}
