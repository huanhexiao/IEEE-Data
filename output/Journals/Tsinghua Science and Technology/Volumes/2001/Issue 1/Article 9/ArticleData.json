The optimal clipping level for an ATCCR is analyzed, computed, and compared with several other diversity combining technologies. Since the A TCCR can estimate the power of the jamming and the number of jammed frequency cells to adaptively adjust the clipper's threshold, the system performance using the adaptive threshold clipper combining technique can be greatly improved.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "42", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "44", "date_publication": "March 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "42 - 44"}, "authors": ["Limin Xiao", "Xibin Xu", "Yan Yao"], "keywords": ["Adaptive systems", "Diversity reception", "Frequency diversity", "Frequency shift keying", "Jamming", "Noise", "Receivers", "Fast Frequency Hopping (FFH) systems", "diversity combining", "partial-band noise jamming", ""], "arnumber": "6083369"}
