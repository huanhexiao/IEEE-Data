The tube area is dependent on time and distance. The energy equation used by Kage et al is corrected to avoid the conflict with the isentropic assumption. The effect of the tunnel hood on the pressure wave is studied near the tunnel exit Results show that the tunnel hood is useful in reducing the peak value and the time derivative of the pressure wave.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "331", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "334", "date_publication": "Oct. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "331 - 334"}, "authors": ["Yuguang Yang", "Keqin Zhu", "Baoshu Xi"], "keywords": ["Electron tubes", "Heating", "History", "Nose", "Shape", "Shock waves", "Tin", "method of characteristics", "one-dimensional flow", "pressure wave", "tunnel hood", ""], "arnumber": "6083443"}
