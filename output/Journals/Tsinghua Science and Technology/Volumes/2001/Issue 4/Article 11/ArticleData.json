The analytical model consists of a simple disc-shaft rotor and a fixed stator. The perturbation is an instantaneous change of the radial velocity when the rotor is operating in its normal steady state. The analysis showed that the rotor may continue rubbing the stator for small clearance, even if the initial perturbation no longer exists. For the interest of engineering applications, we investi gated various rotating speeds, perturbation amplitudes and clearances between the rotor and the stator. Various friction coefficients on the contact surface were also considered. The graphical results can be used for the design of rotating machines.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "335", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "339", "date_publication": "Oct. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "335 - 339"}, "authors": ["Xiaozhang Zhang", "Z.
