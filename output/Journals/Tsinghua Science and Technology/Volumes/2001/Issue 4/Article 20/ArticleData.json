To reduce the communication cost, as well as to guarantee the locality of all subtasks, the volume data is divided into and organized as a series of slices. The task subdivision algorithm produces acceptable load balancing by maintaining and employing a database of performance indices. An asynchronous binary method merges all partial images in O (logn) time. An efficient development platform based on TCP/IP and Socket standards can help parallelize various rendering algorithms on virtual machines. Our algorithm was implemented on this platform using the classical client/server paradigm. The scalabilities lities of both task size and host number were tested experimentally.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "377", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "382", "date_publication": "Oct. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "377 - 382"}, "authors": ["Junhui Deng", "Zesheng Tang"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Heuristic algorithms", "Image color analysis", "Merging", "Rendering (computer graphics)", "Servers", "Virtual machining", "load balancing", "parallel virtual machine", "scalability", "volume rendering", ""], "arnumber": "6083453"}
