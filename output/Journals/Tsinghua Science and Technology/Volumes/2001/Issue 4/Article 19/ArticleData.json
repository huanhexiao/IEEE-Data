The frequency waveform of each sub-band of the linear-prediction coding (LPC) residue is used to calculate the autocorrelation function. Its periodicity is analyzed to determine if it is voice or unvoice. The principles of this UV decision are compatible with that of the full-band speech UV decision. A subjective listening test showed that the speech synthesized by this method is not inferior to that of the standard multi-band exitation (MBE) algorithm.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "374", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "376", "date_publication": "Oct. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "374 - 376"}, "authors": ["Yongming Li", "Hongyi Chen", "Yiting Zhu"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Frequency conversion", "Frequency domain analysis", "Frequency synthesizers", "Harmonic analysis", "Speech", "Speech coding", "autocorrelation", "residue", "sub-band", "ultraviolet (UV) decision", ""], "arnumber": "6083452"}
