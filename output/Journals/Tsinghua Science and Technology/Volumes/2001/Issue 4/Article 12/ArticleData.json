All of the flow equation solutions must be computed to explore the mechanisms of voltage instability and voltage collapse. Conventional algorithms, such as Newton's methods and its variations, are not very desirable because they cannot be easily used to find all of the solutions. This paper investigate homotopy methods which can be used for numerically computing the set of all isolated solutions of multivariate polynomial systems resulting from load flow computations. The results significantly reduce the number of paths being followed.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "340", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "343", "date_publication": "Oct. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "340 - 343"}, "authors": ["Yurong Chen", "Doyong Cai"], "keywords": ["Computers", "Load flow", "Mathematical model", "Polynomials", "Sparse matrices", "Bemshte in-Khoranski-Kushnirenko (BKK) bound", "Bezout number", "homotopy methods", "load flow computations", ""], "arnumber": "6083445"}
