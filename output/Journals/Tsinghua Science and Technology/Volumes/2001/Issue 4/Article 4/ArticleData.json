Undoubtedly, it will have wide applications in military and commercial fields. However, current micro inertial sensors do not have sufficient accuracy, so, its applications are limited to some extent. This paper describes a microminiature inertial measurement system and its design, operating theory and error control techniques. In addition, its performance and applications are evaluated.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "298", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "303", "date_publication": "Oct. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "298 - 303"}, "authors": ["Gang Mao", "Qitai Gu"], "keywords": ["Accelerometers", "Gyroscopes", "Microcomputers", "Position measurement", "Sensor systems", "Silicon", "error control technique", "micro inertial measurement unit", "micro/nano technology", ""], "arnumber": "6083437"}
