Conventional one-dimensional systolic array architecture is used to develop a novel ring-like systolic array architecture through operator rescheduling considering the symmetry of the data flow. High-latency delay due to stuffing of the array pipeline in the conventional architecture was eliminated. The new architecture delivers a higher throughput rate, achieves higher processor utilization, and has low-power consumption. In addition, the minimum memory bandwidth of the conventional architecture is preserved.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "361", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "368", "date_publication": "Oct. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "361 - 368"}, "authors": ["Wujian Zhang", "Xiaohai Qiu", "Runde Zhou", "Hongyi Chen", "Kondo Toshio", "Nakashima Takayoshi", "Ishitani Tsunehacbi"], "keywords": ["Arrays", "Bandwidth", "Delay", "Motion estimation", "Pipeline processing", "Vectors", "full search", "low-latency", "low-power", "motion estimation", "systolic array", ""], "arnumber": "6083450"}
