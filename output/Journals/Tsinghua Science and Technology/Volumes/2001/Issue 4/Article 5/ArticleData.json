This article reviews recent developments in the field for the optimal design of the dither mechanism that decides the effect of bias to some extent. The proper dither signal and its control directly influence dither efficiercy. Stable and accurate error compensation can further the improve the performance of RLG. Some proposals are then made for future research in the field.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "304", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "309", "date_publication": "Oct. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "304 - 309"}, "authors": ["Kedong Wang", "Qitai Gu"], "keywords": ["Error compensation", "Frequency control", "Frequency modulation", "Gyroscopes", "Noise", "Ring lasers", "Springs", "dither", "error compensation", "gyroscope", "ring laser gyroscope (RLG)", ""], "arnumber": "6083438"}
