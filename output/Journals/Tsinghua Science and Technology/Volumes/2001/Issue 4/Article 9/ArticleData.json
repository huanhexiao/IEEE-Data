The defects considered are part-through slots with various geometric configurations. The engineering situation considered here has practical importance in the pressure vessel industry. The results are compared with those obtained by a step-by-step procedure using the professional code ABAQUS and where possible, with those provided by semiempirical formulae used by industry. The limit and shakedown analysis methods are found to be more economical and more reliable than marching solutions achieved by step-by-step elastic-plastic analysis. The effects of various part-through slots on the load-carrying capacities of pressure vessels are investigated.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "326", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "330", "date_publication": "Oct. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "326 - 330"}, "authors": ["Bin Yang", "Gang Chen", "Zhifeng Xu", "Bingye Xu"], "keywords": ["Finite element methods", "Industries", "Kinematics", "Plastics", "Shape", "Strain", "Stress", "defects", "limit analysis", "pressure vessel", "shakedown analysis", ""], "arnumber": "6083442"}
