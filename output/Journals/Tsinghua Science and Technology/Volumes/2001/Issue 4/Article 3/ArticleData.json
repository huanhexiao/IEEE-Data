The FNS multiarticular muscle control system based on the fuzzy controller was developed with the fuzzy control rule base. Simulation experiments were then conducted for the joint angle trajectories of both the elbow flexion and the wrist flexion usi ng the proposed fuzzy control algorithm and a conventional PID contrd algorithm with the FNS physical multiarticular muscle control system. The simulation results demonstrated that the proposed fuzzy control method is more suitable for the physiological characteristics than conventional PID control. In particular, both the trajectory-following and the stability of the FNS multi articular muscle control system were greatly improved. Furthermore, the stimulating pulse trains generated by the fuzzy controller were stable and smooth.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "294", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "297", "date_publication": "Oct. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "294 - 297"}, "authors": ["Huaiyu Wu", "Zhaoying Zhou", "Shenshu Xiong"], "keywords": ["Elbow", "Fuzzy control", "Gyroscopes", "Joints", "Muscles", "Wrist", "biomedical engineering", "functional neuromuscular stimulation (FNS)", "fuzzy control", "multiarticular muscles", "stimulation patterns", "trajectory-following", ""], "arnumber": "6083436"}
