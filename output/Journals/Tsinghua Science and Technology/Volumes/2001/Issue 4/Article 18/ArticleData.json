The model assumes that the current state of speech is only a correction of the last previous state. According to the C-V (Consonant-Vowel) structure of the Chinese language, a speech segmentation method is also implerrented in the SFNNAM model. This model has a definite physical meaning grounded on the structure of the Chinese language and is easily implemented in very large scale integrated circuit (VLSI). In the speech recognition experiment, less calculations were need than in the hidden Markov models (HMM) based algorithm. The recognition rate for Chinese numbers was 93.5% for the first candidate and 99.5% for the first two candidates.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "369", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "373", "date_publication": "Oct. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "369 - 373"}, "authors": ["Xianzhi Li", "Yihe Sun"], "keywords": ["Hidden Markov models", "Mathematical model", "Neurons", "Speech", "Speech processing", "Speech recognition", "Training", "Chinese speech recognition", "SFNNAM model", "neural network", "speech recognition", ""], "arnumber": "6083451"}
