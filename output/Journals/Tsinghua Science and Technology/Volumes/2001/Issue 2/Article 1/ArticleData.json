Emphasis is put on the theoretical understanding of the structural transitions, the macroscopic dielectric properties, and the relationship between them. The influences of the composition, the temperature, and the atomic interactions on the order-disorder microstructures can be well understood in the cluster-variation-method calculations. The criterion drawn from theoretical analysis is successful in predicting the order-disorder structure of relaxors. Among various physical models about relaxors, the dipole glassy model that described the dielectric response as the thermally activated flips of the local spontaneous polarization under random interactions is discussed in details. The Monte Carlo simulation results of this model are consistent with the linear and nonlinear experiments of relaxors.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "97", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "108", "date_publication": "June 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "97 - 108"}, "authors": ["Zhongqing Wu", "Zhirong Liu", "Binglin Gu"], "keywords": ["Crystals", "Dielectrics", "Iron", "Lead", "Relaxor ferroelectrics", "Superlattices", "Temperature", "complex perovskite", "order-disorder transition", "relaxor ferroelectrics", ""], "arnumber": "6083344"}
