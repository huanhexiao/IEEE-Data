During the last decade, the problem of quantum tunneling of magnetization in nanometer-scale magnets has attracted a great deal of theoretical and experimental interest. A review of recent theoretical research of the macroscopic quantum phenomena in nanorreter-scale single-domain magnets is presented in this paper. It includes macroscopic quantum tunneling (MQT) and cohererce (MQC) in single-domain magnetic particles, the topological phase interfererce or spin-parity effects, and tunneling of magnetization in an arbitrarily directed magnetic field. The general formulas are shown to evaluate the tunneling rate and the tunneling level splitting for single-domain AFM particles. A nontrivial generalization of Krarrers degeneracy for double-well system is provided to coherently spin tunneling for spin systems with m-fold rotational symmetry. The effects induced by the external magnetic field have been studied, where the field is along the easy, medium, hard axis, or arbitrary direction.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "109", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "129", "date_publication": "June 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "109 - 129"}, "authors": ["Rong L\u00fc", "Jialin Zhu"], "keywords": ["Magnetic domains", "Magnetic hysteresis", "Magnetic separation", "Magnetic tunneling", "Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy", "macroscopic quantum tunneling and coherence", "mesoscopic magnetic systems", "spin-phase interfererce", ""], "arnumber": "6083345"}
