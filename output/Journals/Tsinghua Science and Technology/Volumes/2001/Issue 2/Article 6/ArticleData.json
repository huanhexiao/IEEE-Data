The main flavonoid aglycons extracted into the ethyl ether phase are the subject of this study. The flavonoid aglycons-mycetin, quercetin, kaempferol and farrerol, were separated and identified by thin layer chromatography (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometer/mass spectrometer (LC/MS/MS). A simple and rapid HPLC method was developed for quantitative determination of quercetin and kaempferol in Rhododendron leaves, ethanol extracts and Jinjuan oral liquid drug (Liquor Jinjuan). The analysis of quercetin is useful for quality control of medicinal materials and Liquor Jinjuan products.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "160", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "163", "date_publication": "June 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "160 - 163"}, "authors": ["Hongxia Li", "Mingyu Ding", "Zhuping Wu"], "keywords": ["Compounds", "Crystals", "Drugs", "Ethanol", "Methanol", "Solvents", "Standards", "flavonoid aglycons", "high performance liquid chrorratography (HPLC)", "liquid chromatography/mass spectrometer/mass spectrometer (LC/MS/MS)", "rhododendron L", "thin layer chromatography (TLC)", ""], "arnumber": "6083349"}
