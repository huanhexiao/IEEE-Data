The energy and pollution reductions resulting from the catalysts have been examined with thermal analysis and chromatography. The CCS agents lower the ignition temperature by 30\u201380\u00b0C and improve the coal corrbustion efficiercy by 10%\u201325%. The agents also reduce the release of carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and coal particles to environment. The working mechanisms of the catalysts are discussed in terms of their participation in various physico-chemical processes during combustion.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "156", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "159", "date_publication": "June 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "156 - 159"}, "authors": ["Zenghua Wu", "Zhiwu Yu", "Wentao Zhu", "Rui Zhou"], "keywords": ["Additives", "Ash", "Carbon dioxide", "Coal", "Combustion", "Ignition", "catalytic effect", "coal", "environmental protection", ""], "arnumber": "6083348"}
