Secondly, thermodynanic modeling of metallic glass formation is developed with special consideration of the interfacial free energy of the multilayers. Thirdly, results of molecular dynamics simulations for some representative systems are presented to show the calculation of the glass-forming ability directly from the inter-atomic potential of the binary metal systems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "130", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "150", "date_publication": "June 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "130 - 150"}, "authors": ["Zhengcao Li", "Wensheng Lai", "Baixin Liu"], "keywords": ["Atomic layer deposition", "Glass", "Metals", "Nonhomogeneous media", "Solids", "Thermodynamics", "arrorphous alloys", "ion mixing", "metallic glass forming ability", "molecular-dynamics simulation", "thermodynamic modeling", ""], "arnumber": "6083346"}
