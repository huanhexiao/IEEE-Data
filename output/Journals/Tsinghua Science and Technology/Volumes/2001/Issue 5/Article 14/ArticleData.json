A method to combine the ultrasonic waves to the welding process using arc-excited ultrasonic emssion called arc-ultrasonic, was high frequency modulation of the arc-plasma. The effects of arc-ultrasonic on the weld including the fusion zone, the partially melted zone and the heat-affected zone are described. The arc-ultrasonic energy changes the weld microstructure. In the fusion zone, the primary dendrite arm spacing decreases significantly and more acicular femite appears. In the partially melted zone, a large amount of fine grains appear. In the heat-affected zone, the width of the tempered zone increases with increasing modulation frequency and the microstructure is refined. The results show that arc-ul trasonic is a new and effective way for improving weld quality.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "475", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "478", "date_publication": "Dec. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "475 - 478"}, "authors": ["Chunlei Zhang", "Minsherq Wu", "Jinglei Du"], "keywords": ["Acoustics", "Ferrites", "Frequency modulation", "Grain size", "Metals", "Vibrations", "Welding", "arc-ultrasonic", "fine grain", "fusion zore", "heat-affected zone", "partially melted zone", ""], "arnumber": "6083423"}
