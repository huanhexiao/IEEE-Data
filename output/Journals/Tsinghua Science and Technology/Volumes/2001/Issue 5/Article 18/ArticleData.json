Oscillating fluid mechanics theory was used to determine the oscillating flow field around the inducer for various external oscillating perturbation frequencies. Enomrous pressures can occur at some frequercies, which are sufficient to break the inducer. Some design changes were analyzed to improve the flow induced vibration characteristics.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "492", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "496", "date_publication": "Dec. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "492 - 496"}, "authors": ["Hengli Liang", "Zuoyi Chen"], "keywords": ["Fluids", "Mathematical model", "Oscillators", "Polynomials", "Pumps", "Vibrations", "flow induced vibration", "inducer", "numerical calculation", "paremetric polynomial method (PPM)", ""], "arnumber": "6083427"}
