AP2/EREBP transcription factors play a variety of regulatory roles in several developmental processes and in response to biotic and environmental stresses. Using the yeast one-hybrid analysis system, we demonstrated that TINY could furction as a DREB-like transcription factor specifically binding to the dehydration-responsive element (DRE) cis-acting element.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "432", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "437", "date_publication": "Dec. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "432 - 437"}, "authors": ["Zhifang Cao", "Feng Chen", "Jie Li", "Yiqin Li", "Haimeng Zhou", "Guiyou Zhang", "Qiang Liu"], "keywords": ["Amino acids", "DNA", "Encoding", "Proteins", "Strain", "Tin", "Vectors", "TINY", "dehydration-responsive element (DRE)", "transcription factor", ""], "arnumber": "6083417"}
