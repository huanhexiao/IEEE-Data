A total of 49-da ta points of speed of sound for gaseous HFC-125 were measured for temperatures from 273 to 313 K and pressures from 32 to 479 kPa with a cylindrical, variable-path acoustic interferometer. The ideal-gas heat capacity at constant pressure and the second acoustic Virial coefficient were determined over the temperature range from the speed of sound measurements and were correlated as functions of temperature. An analytical expression for the second Virial coefficient derived using the square-well intennolecular potential model was compared with the data.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "479", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "483", "date_publication": "Dec. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "479 - 483"}, "authors": ["Chang Zhang", "Yuanyuan Duan", "Xin Wang", "Mingshan Zhu"], "keywords": ["Acoustic measurements", "Acoustics", "Heating", "Pressure measurement", "Temperature distribution", "Temperature measurement", "Transducers", "ideal-gas heat capacity at constan pressure", "pentafluoroe thane (HFC-125)", "second Virial coeffieient", "speed of sound", ""], "arnumber": "6083424"}
