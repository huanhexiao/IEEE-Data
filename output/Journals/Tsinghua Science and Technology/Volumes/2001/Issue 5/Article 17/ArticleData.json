The results show that oscillating disturbances can be rapidly dissipated when the disturbance occurs at the inlet except for very high-frequercy oscillation such as 50 kHz. Dangerous low-frequercy oscillations occur at the outlet. The effects of the flow parameter variations on the oscillating disturbance propagation are also studied. The analysis will facilitate safe operation of the whole rocket system.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "488", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "491", "date_publication": "Dec. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "488 - 491"}, "authors": ["Hong Liu", "Xiaolin Zheng", "Zuoyi Chen"], "keywords": ["Blades", "Fluids", "Mathematical model", "Oscillators", "Polynomials", "Turbines", "flow induced vibration", "hydrogen turbine", "oscillating fluid mechanics theorem", "parametric", "polynomial method", ""], "arnumber": "6083426"}
