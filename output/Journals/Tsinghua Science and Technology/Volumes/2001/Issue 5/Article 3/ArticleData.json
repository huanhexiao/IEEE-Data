They were preincubated at 100 for 15 mn and then cooled on ice immediately. The chaperone-like activities of preheated proteins were measured at 37 using DTT-treated insulin B chains as substrates. Both preheated proteins exhibited greatly enhanced chaperone-like activities, accompanied with almost unchanged secondary structures and surface hydrophobicity but with a minor change in tertiary structures. The dramatically enhanced chaperone-like activities of preheated \u03b1-crystallin and Hspl6. 3 may have resulted from the imeversible change in the tertiary structure as detected by near-UV CD spectra.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "406", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "409", "date_publication": "Dec. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "406 - 409"}, "authors": ["Qilong Mao", "Danxia Ke", "Zengyi Chang"], "keywords": ["Electric shock", "Fluorescence", "Heat treatment", "Heating", "Insulin", "Proteins", "Substrates", "chaperone activity", "heat treatment", "small heat shock protein", ""], "arnumber": "6083412"}
