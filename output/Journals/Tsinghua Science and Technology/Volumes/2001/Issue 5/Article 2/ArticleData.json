In this investigation, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were used to study the effect of two enhancers, 1, 2-propanediol and azone, on lipids extracted from SC (SC lipids). The two enhancers affected the SC lipids. However, their function modes were different. The penetration enhancing mechanisms of the two enhancers are discussed based on their effects on SC lipids and on their efficiencies in arbutin permeation enhancement.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "401", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "405", "date_publication": "Dec. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "401 - 405"}, "authors": ["Hongwu Wang", "Fei Li", "Yandao Gong", "Min Dong", "Xiufang Zhang", "Nanming Zhao"], "keywords": ["Chemicals", "Drugs", "Fluorescence", "Lipidomics", "Skin", "Temperature distribution", "Temperature measurement", "1, 2-propanediol", "Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)", "azone", "differential scanning calorimetry(DSC)", "permeation", "stratum corneum (SC)", ""], "arnumber": "6083411"}
