The clinical applications illustrate the encouraging performance of the method. The number of trials needed is reduced to 3, but the estimated VEP complex is clearer than that obtained by conventional ensemble averaging with 50 trials. By analyzing the time course and spatial pattern of the independent components (ICs) of the multi-channel PVEP, one component is found to be reasonably related to the P100 peak.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "503", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "508", "date_publication": "Dec. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "503 - 508"}, "authors": ["Bo Hong", "Fusheng Yang", "Yingfu Pan", "Qngyu Tang", "Kui Chen", "Yanmei Tie"], "keywords": ["Electric potential", "Electrodes", "Electroencephalography", "Estimation", "Independent component analysis", "Scalp", "Vectors", "P100 peak", "independent component analysis", "pattern-reversal visual evoked potential (PVEP)", "single trial estination", ""], "arnumber": "6083430"}
