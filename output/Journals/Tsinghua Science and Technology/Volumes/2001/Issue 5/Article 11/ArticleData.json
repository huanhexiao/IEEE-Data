Connectors are installed in vertical slits in the slitted shear wall to provide the dual function slitted shear wall with greater stiffness and capacity for small and moderate earthquake intensities. The wall becomes a slitted wall with the ductile flexure failure mode when the connectors fail during severe earthquakes. Seven specimens were tested to study the seismic behavior of the dual function slitted shear wall. The results showed that the connector controlled function well and provided better seismic behavior.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "453", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "457", "date_publication": "Dec. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "453 - 457"}, "authors": ["Lieping Ye", "Sheng Kang"], "keywords": ["Computer crashes", "Concrete", "Connectors", "Earthquakes", "Loading", "Skeleton", "Solids", "connector", "reinforced concrete", "seismic control", "slitted wall", ""], "arnumber": "6083420"}
