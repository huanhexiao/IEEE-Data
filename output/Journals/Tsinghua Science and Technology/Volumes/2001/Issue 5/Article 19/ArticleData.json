The theoretical results show that the net charges in the streamer channel at normal temperatures are zero, but they are positive at high temperatures so that the advancing field is reinforced more than that at normal temperatures. Therefore, the field required for streamer propagation is reduced at high temperatures. The sparkover voltage is largely reduced with increased temperature, which is influenced by the solid materials in the flame.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "497", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "499", "date_publication": "Dec. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "497 - 499"}, "authors": ["Liming Wang", "Zhicheng Guan", "Qihao Hu", "Xidong Liang", "Xinfu Sheng", "N.
