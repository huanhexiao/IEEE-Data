Computer simulation tests show that not only does the control scheme achieve satisfactory decoupling of the high and low pressure turbines and the electric power, remarkably improving the transient stability, but also the design is very intuitive and concise.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "484", "volume": "6", "lastpage": "487", "date_publication": "Dec. 2001", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2001", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "484 - 487"}, "authors": ["Haorong Li", "Liqin Li", "Donghai Li", "Zhaoxing Song", "Wei Wang"], "keywords": ["Control systems", "Mathematical model", "Power system stability", "Stability analysis", "Thermal stability", "Transient analysis", "decoupling", "double extraction", "inverse system", "nonlinear control", ""], "arnumber": "6083425"}
