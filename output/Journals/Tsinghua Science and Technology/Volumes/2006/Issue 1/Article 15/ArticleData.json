The improved decoding procedure uses the node capacity of the logistics system as an important factor, which influences the decoding procedure. As a result, any Prufer number produced stochastically can be decoded to a feasible logistics pattern, which matchs the node capacities of the logistics system. With effective capacity coding, an unbalanced logistics system can be converted to a set of balanced systems. The effective capacity coding was combined with the Prufer number to construct the chromosome for the new method to search the whole solution space of the unbalanced multi-stage logistics system. Simulation results show that the new method finds a better solution with less computational time than st-GA. Although using a little more memory, the new method is still an efficient and robust method for optimizing unbalanced multi-stage logistics systems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "96", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "101", "date_publication": "Feb. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "96 - 101"}, "authors": ["Hang Xu", "Rang Xu", "Qingtai Ye"], "keywords": ["Biological cells", "Decoding", "Encoding", "Genetic algorithms", "Logistics", "Memory management", "Vectors", "Pr&#x00FC", "fer number", "effective capacity", "genetic algorithm", "logistics", "optimization", "spanning tree", "unbalanced multi-stage logistics system", ""], "arnumber": "6076291"}
