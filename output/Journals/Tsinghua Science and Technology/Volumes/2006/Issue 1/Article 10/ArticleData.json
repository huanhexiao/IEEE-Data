The model includes the transport in the diffusion layer and the proton exchange membrane (PEM) with a pseudo-homogeneous model for the cathode catalyst layer. The predicted fuel cell performance with variable cathode porosities compares well with experimental results. The model is then used to investigate the effects of some structural parameters, such as the rib size, the interdigitated flow field, and various operating conditions including the gas flow rate, the cell temperature and pressure, humidification, and the relative humidity at the inlet. Water management is best achieved by tuning the anode operating conditions.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "54", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "64", "date_publication": "Feb. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "54 - 64"}, "authors": ["Cheng Bao", "Minggao Ouyang", "Baolian Yi"], "keywords": ["Anodes", "Cathodes", "Current density", "Equations", "Fuel cells", "Mathematical model", "Protons", "fuel cells", "mathematical model", "proton exchange membrane (PEM)", "water management", ""], "arnumber": "6075862"}
