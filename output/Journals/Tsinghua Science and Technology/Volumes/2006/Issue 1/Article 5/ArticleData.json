The translation examples are annotated by the representation of the TCT structure. Each TCT describes not only the syntactic structure of the source sentence (i.e., Portuguese in our system) but also the translation correspondences (i.e., Chinese translation). In addition, the TCT nodes describe the corresponding linguistic relationships between the source and target languages. The translation examples can be effectively represented with this annotation schema and organized in the bilingual knowledge database or example base. In the real machine translation process, the target language is synthesized with higher quality by referring to the TCT translation information.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "31", "date_publication": "Feb. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "25 - 31"}, "authors": ["Fai Wong", "Mingchui Dong", "Dongcheng Hu"], "keywords": ["Buildings", "Educational institutions", "Indexes", "Knowledge based systems", "Pragmatics", "Speech", "Syntactics", "Portuguese to Chinese MT", "example representation schema", "machine translation (MT)", "translation corresponding tree (TCT)", ""], "arnumber": "6075857"}
