Although integration and careful layout can alleviate I/Q mismatch, circuit and system level calibrations are also needed due to process variations and variable operating conditions. The amplitude imbalance between I/Q channels was calibrated using a modified R-2R ladder to achieve fine linear-in-dB variable gain. A downconversion mixer working in the 2.4-GHz band was developed for a wireless local area network (WLAN) ZIF receiver using O.25-\u03bcm complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS). The twostage mixer configuration relaxes the tradeoff between noise and linearity. Experimental results verify the fine linear-in-dB variable conversion gain of the mixer, which can also be used as part of an automatic gain control (AGC) loop.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "8", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "11", "date_publication": "Feb. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "8 - 11"}, "authors": ["Dong Feng", "Bingxue Shi"], "keywords": ["CMOS integrated circuits", "Gain", "Gain control", "Mixers", "Noise", "Receivers", "Resistors", "automatic gain control (AGC)", "complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS)", "ladder circuits", "mixer noise", "wireless local area network (WLAN)", "zero intermediate frequency (ZIF)", ""], "arnumber": "6075854"}
