However, the bit error performance of such systems over Nakagami channels with an arbitrary covariance matrix and real distinct fading parameters has been seldom described in the literature. This paper studies the problem using a generic correlated Nakagami fading model and presents a closed form solution which is used to study the influence of the fading parameters and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) distribution ratios among all the branches on the bit error performance. Moreover, the average SNRs of each branch are not restricted to one value in the analysis. The closed form solution developed for the problem can be used to study the influence of the fading parameters and the SNR distribution ratios on the error performance.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "32", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "37", "date_publication": "Feb. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "32 - 37"}, "authors": ["Darning Hang", "Xiaowei Cui", "Zhigang Cao"], "keywords": ["Covariance matrix", "Differential phase shift keying", "Diversity reception", "Fading", "Frequency shift keying", "Nakagami distribution", "Signal to noise ratio", "Nakagami channels", "differential phase shift keying (DPSK)", "diversity reception", "noncoherent frequency shift keying (NFSK)", ""], "arnumber": "6075858"}
