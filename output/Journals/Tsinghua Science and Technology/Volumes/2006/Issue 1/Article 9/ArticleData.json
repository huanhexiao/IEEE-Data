An improved fuzzy clustering algorithm was developed based on the conventional fuzzy c-means (FCM) to obtain better quality clustering results. The update equations for the membership and the cluster center are derived from the alternating optimization algorithm. Two fuzzy scattering matrices in the objective function assure the compactness between data points and cluster centers, and also strengthen the separation between cluster centers in terms of a novel separable criterion. The clustering algorithm properties are shown to be an improvement over the FCM method's properties. Numerical simulations show that the clustering algorithm gives more accurate clustering results than the FCM method.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "50", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "53", "date_publication": "Feb. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "50 - 53"}, "authors": ["Zhonghang Yin", "Yuangang Tang", "Fuchun Sun", "Zengqi Sun"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Clustering algorithms", "Equations", "Mathematical model", "Optimization", "Scattering", "Vectors", "alternating optimization", "fuzzy c-means (FCM)", "fuzzy clustering", ""], "arnumber": "6075861"}
