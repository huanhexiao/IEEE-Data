Normal jobs can be processed on any of the parallel machines, while the special jobs can only be processed on one machine. The problem is analyzed for various manufacturing conditions and service requirements. The off-line scheduling problem is transformed into a classical parallel machine scheduling problem. The on-line scheduling uses the FCFS (first come, first served), SWSC (special window for special customers), and FFFS (first fit, first served) algorithms to satisfy the various requirements. Furthermore, this paper proves that FCFS has a competitive ratio of m, where m is the number of parallel machines, and this bound is asymptotically tight, SWSC has a competitive ratio of 2 and FFFS has a competitive ratio of 3\u201321 m, and these bounds are tight.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "107", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "110", "date_publication": "Feb. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "107 - 110"}, "authors": ["Zhenbo Wang", "Wenxun Xing"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Approximation algorithms", "Field-flow fractionation", "Job shop scheduling", "Parallel machines", "Schedules", "heuristics", "on-line", "parallel machine scheduling", "worst-case analysis", ""], "arnumber": "6076293"}
