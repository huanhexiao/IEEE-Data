The SCSI target emulator works with general storage devices with multiple transport protocols. The target emulator utilizes a protocol conversion module that translates the SCSI protocols to a variety of storage devices and implements the multi-RAID-Ievel configuration and storage visualization functions. Moreover, the target emulator implements RAM caching, multi-queuing, and request merging to effectively improve the lID response speed of the general storage devices. The throughput and average response times of the target emulator for block sizes of 4 KB to 128 KB are 1500/0 faster for reads and 670/0 faster for writes than the existing emulator. With a block size of 16 KB, the lID latency of the target emulator is only about 200/0 that of the existing emulator.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "38", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "43", "date_publication": "Feb. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "38 - 43"}, "authors": ["Jiaming Pan", "Jiwu Shu", "Suqin Zhang", "Weimin Zheng"], "keywords": ["Merging", "Performance evaluation", "Protocols", "Random access memory", "Storage area networks", "Throughput", "Time factors", "SCSI target emulator", "iSCSI", "storage area network (SAN)", ""], "arnumber": "6075859"}
