Very often, eCRM is interfaced with other information systems to form a seamless integration and interchange of information both inside and outside an organization-a work flow management system. This integration of business partners, suppliers, and customers is essential in this global competitive market environment. An effective infrastructure and hence an appropriate framework are required to provide the information exchange and data analysis between eCRM and work flow management. This paper proposes a functional framework of eCRM based on customer value to realize the win-win strategy for both the companies and their customers. Moreover, a workflow management system also forms an integral part of this total solution to facilitate the implementation of a supply chain or extended enterprise.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "65", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "73", "date_publication": "Feb. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "65 - 73"}, "authors": ["W.
