The results show that push-over analysis is sensitive to the lateral load patterns, so the use of at least two load patterns that are expected to bound the inertia force distributions is recommended. The M-\u03c6 curves and N-M interaction surfaces of the CFRT columns calculated either by Han's formulae or by the USC-RC program (reinforced concrete program put forward by University of Southern Califonia) are suitable for future push-over analyses of CFRT structures. The P-\u03b4 effect affects the MRF seismic behavior seriously, and so should be taken into account in MRF seismic analysis. In addition, three kinds of RC structures were analyzed to allow a comparison of the earthquake resistance behavior of CFRT structures and RC structures. The results show that the ductility and seismic performance of CFRT structures are superior to those of RC structures. Consequently, CFRT structures are recommended in seismic regions.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "124", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "130", "date_publication": "Feb. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "124 - 130"}, "authors": ["Jianguo Nie", "Kai Qin", "Van Xiao"], "keywords": ["Earthquakes", "Electron tubes", "Fasteners", "Plastics", "Resistance", "Steel", "Structural beams", "capacity curve", "concrete-filled rectangular steel tube", "push-over analysis", "reinforced concrete", ""], "arnumber": "6076296"}
