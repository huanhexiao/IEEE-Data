A stress \u03c3y tensioned flat plate with edge cracks is widely used as an analysis model. The stresses \u03c3x and \u03c3y for the plate model can be acquired from Neuber's solution. However, the solution is applicable only for a perfect plane stress or plane strain state. As a consequence of the thickness of the plate a three-dimensional (3-~) stress state will arise near the crack tip, resulting in a variation of the distribution of \u03c3x and \u03c3y stresses. A full analysis for the 3-D stress fields for a tensioned flat plate with edge cracks has been therefore carried out. The results show that the 3-D stress field near the crack tip is mainly determined by two factors: the thickness of the plate and the curvature radius at the crack tip. A further analysis has been carried out for the stress intensity near the crack tip. In this paper we give some equations matching to the 3-D stress and stress intensity, which describe precisely the stress state near the crack tip, and which can be applied effectively in engineering analysis.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "131", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "136", "date_publication": "Feb. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "131 - 136"}, "authors": ["Yuanqing Wang", "Yanmin Wu", "Yongjiu Shi", "Jianjing Jiang"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Finite element methods", "Materials", "Solid modeling", "Steel", "Strain", "Stress", "crack tip", "stress in the thickness direction", "stress intensity", "three-dimensional stress", ""], "arnumber": "6076297"}
