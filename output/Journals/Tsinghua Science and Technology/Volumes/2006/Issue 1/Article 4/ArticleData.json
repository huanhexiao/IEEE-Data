Conventional adaptive antenna array-based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)/OFDM systems use the sub-carriers characterized by the largest eigenvalue to transmit the OFDM symbols. This paper describes the performance of adaptive subchannel assignment-based MIMO/OFDM systems over multipath fading channels. The system adaptively selects the eigenvectors associated with the relatively large subchannel eigenvalues to generate the antenna array weights at the base and mobile stations and then adaptively assigns the corresponding best subchannels to transmit the OFDM symbols. Simulation results show that the proposed system can achieve better performance than the conventional adaptive antenna arraybased MIMO/OFDM system over multipath fading channels.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "24", "date_publication": "Feb. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "19 - 24"}, "authors": ["Yahan Pan", "Khaled Ben Letaief", "Zhigang Cao"], "keywords": ["Adaptive arrays", "Adaptive systems", "Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions", "OFDM", "Receiving antennas", "Transmitting antennas", "adaptive subchannel assignment", "joint transmit and receive antenna array weighting", "multipath fading channel", "multiple input multiple-output (MIMO)/orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)", ""], "arnumber": "6075856"}
