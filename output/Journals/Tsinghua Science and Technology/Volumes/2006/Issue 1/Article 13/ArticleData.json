A relationship between measured information and identification results is obtained by analyzing numerous matrix transforms and OR decompositions. When distributions of measurement error are determined, random distributions of identification result disturbances (I RDs) can be obtained from this relationship as a function of measurement errors. Then the ranges of the IRDs can be effectively estimated, even if true parameter values are unknown. An optimization index based on IRD estimate is presented to select measurement configurations to achieve smaller IRDs. Two simulation examples were carried out with different modes and calibration methods. The results show that the method is effective and that the optimization index is useful. Some regular parameter identification problems can be explained by the IRD estimates.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "80", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "87", "date_publication": "Feb. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "80 - 87"}, "authors": ["Meng Gao", "Tiemin Li", "Xiaoqiang Tang", "Guanghong Duan"], "keywords": ["Calibration", "Indexes", "Joints", "Kinematics", "Mathematical model", "Position measurement", "Vectors", "calibration", "disturbance", "estimate", "identification", "parallel mechanism", ""], "arnumber": "6076289"}
