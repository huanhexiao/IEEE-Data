Ultrasound at various frequencies, intensities, and time was tested to optimize the operation. The results show that treatment with 30 kHz, 12 W/L ultrasound for 120 s shortened the sludge settling time from 3 h to 1 h and reduced the supernatant Cr concentration. The ultrasonic treatment also reduced the sludge volume from 4.02 mL/g to 2.58 mL/g and increased the sludge Cr concentration by 2/3. The treated sludge could then be reused in the tanning operation. Proper ultrasonic treatment can significantly reduce the sludge volume and enhance the Cr reuse.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "374", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "378", "date_publication": "Aug. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "374 - 378"}, "authors": ["Guangming Zhang", "Panyue Zhang", "Yanming Chen"], "keywords": ["Acoustics", "Chemicals", "Educational institutions", "Inductors", "Solids", "Time frequency analysis", "Ultrasonic imaging", "Cr", "industrial sludge", "sludge volume", "ultrasound", ""], "arnumber": "6075922"}
