Addition of methyl jasmonic acid (MJ) enhances the activity of 10-deaceyle baccatin (DAB) III acetyl transferase which catalyzes the bioconversion from 10-DAB III to beccatin III. In this paper, the baccatin III content was increased by 174% by the addition of 100 \u03bcmol/l, MJ in suspension cultures of Taxus cuspidate. Induction by MJ also increased the expression of a 49.0-kDa protein. This paper describes the cell free acetylation of 10-DAB III in crude extracts of enzyme from the suspension cultures of Taxus cuspidate. The reaction product was confirmed by high performance liquid chromatograph (HPLC). About 25.0% of the 10-DAB III was acetylized into baccatin III on the 4th day with 100 \u00b5mol/l, MJ. The 10-DAB III acetyl transferase activity reached a peak on the 2nd day with 100 \u03bcmol/l, MJ, with 54.7% of the 10-DAB III transformed into baccatin III. The baccatin III content increased with the increase of 10-DAB III acetyl transferase activity, although the biosynthesis was delayed by more than 24 h. The remarkable induction of MJ on baccatin III biosynthesis shows a promising way to increase the production of taxol.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "363", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "367", "date_publication": "June 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "363 - 367"}, "authors": ["Jianfeng Zhang", "Zhigang Guo"], "keywords": ["Biomass", "Compounds", "Methanol", "Proteins", "Suspensions", "10-deaceyle baccatin (DAB) III acetyl transferase", "baccatin III", "biosynthesis", "methyl jasmonic acid", ""], "arnumber": "6075901"}
