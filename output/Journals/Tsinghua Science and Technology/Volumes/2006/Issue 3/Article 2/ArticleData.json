In this paper, two word-level normal basis multiplication algorithms are proposed for GF(2n). The first algorithm is suitable for high complexity normal bases, while the second algorithm is fast for type-I optimal normal bases and low complexity normal bases. Theoretical analyses and experimental results both indicate that the presented algorithms are efficient in GF(2 233), GF(2283), GF(2409), and GF(2 571), which are four of the five binary fields recommended by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for the elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) applications.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "264", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "270", "date_publication": "June 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "264 - 270"}, "authors": ["Haining Fan", "Duo Liu", "Yiqi Dai"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Approximation algorithms", "Arrays", "Complexity theory", "Computers", "Niobium", "Software algorithms", "finite field", "multiplication algorithm", "normal basis", ""], "arnumber": "6075889"}
