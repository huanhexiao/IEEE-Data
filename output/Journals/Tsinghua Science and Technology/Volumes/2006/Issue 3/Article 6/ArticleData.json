Unlike other synchronous grammars, the grammar allows multiple target productions to be associated to a single production rule which can be used to guide a parser to infer different possible translational equivalences for a recognized input string according to the feature constraints of symbols in the pattern. An extended generalized LR algorithm was adapted to the parsing of the proposed formalism to analyze the syntactic structure of a language. The grammar was used as the basis for building a machine translation system for Portuguese to Chinese translation. The empirical results show that the grammar is more expressive when modeling the translational equivalences of parallel texts for machine translation and grammar rewriting applications.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "295", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "306", "date_publication": "June 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "295 - 306"}, "authors": ["Fai Wong", "Mingchui Dong", "Dongcheng Hu"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Grammar", "Pragmatics", "Production", "Semantics", "Syntactics", "Vectors", "Portuguese to Chinese translation", "constraint-based synchronous grammar", "machine translation", ""], "arnumber": "6075893"}
