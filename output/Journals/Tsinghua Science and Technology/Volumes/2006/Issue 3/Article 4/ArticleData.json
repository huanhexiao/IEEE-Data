The bandwidth utilization efficiency can be improved and the quality of service for delay-sensitive variable bit rate traffic such as high rate motion picture experts group (M PEG)-4 traffic can be guaranteed by a simple and efficient algorithm that dynamically sets the burst size of the delayed-acknowledgement (Dly-ACK) based on the IEEE 802.15.3 standard. The burst size was adjusted in response to the wireless channel quality. Furthermore, the burst size was bounded by a maximum acknowledgement burst size setting and the remaining number of un-received blocks of a current supra-block. Simulation results show that the method achieves significant performance enhancement in the job failure rate and throughput compared to immediate-acknowledgement (Imm-ACK) and other fixed burst size Dly-ACK schemes. This algorithm can also be applied in generalized time division multiple access (TDMA) systems by using the block acknowledgement mechanism for delay sensitive traffic.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "278", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "286", "date_publication": "June 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "278 - 286"}, "authors": ["Xin Liu", "Qionghai Dai", "Qiufeng Wu"], "keywords": ["Ad hoc networks", "IEEE 802.15 Standards", "Media Access Protocol", "Personal area networks", "Resource management", "Time division multiple access", "Wireless communication", "delayed-acknowledgement (Dly-ACK)", "medium access control (MAC)", "motion picture experts group (MPEG)-4", "time division multiple access (TDMA)", "ultra-wideband", ""], "arnumber": "6075891"}
