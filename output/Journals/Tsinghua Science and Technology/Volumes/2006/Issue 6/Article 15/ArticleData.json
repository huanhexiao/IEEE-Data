Some model results are presented first with the bifurcation without parameters method, and then the method was used to study bifurcation along the equilibrium manifold for the model. The model does not lose stability even when some equilibria are locally unstable because the equilibrium manifold is stable when treated as a whole. The ecological implications of the results are discussed.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "739", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "744", "date_publication": "Dec. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "739 - 744"}, "authors": ["Xin Zhang", "Yun Tang", "Rudolf Scherer"], "keywords": ["Asymptotic stability", "Bifurcation", "Manifolds", "Numerical stability", "Predator prey systems", "Stability criteria", "bifurcation", "equilibrium manifold", "predator-prey model", "stability", ""], "arnumber": "6075961"}
