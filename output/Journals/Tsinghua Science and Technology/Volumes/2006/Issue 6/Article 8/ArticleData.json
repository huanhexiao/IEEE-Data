The objective of this study is to optimize multiple technical responses at the same time by integrating fuzzy logic transformation into a DoE system. The transformation from technical responses to the individual fuzzy responses and the overall fuzzy response are first defined, and the fuzzy response system is established. The method used to optimize the overall fuzzy response is introduced and discussed. The results show that the established fuzzy response system can optimize systems with multiple technical responses and multiple inputs.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "686", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "692", "date_publication": "Dec. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "686 - 692"}, "authors": ["Fan Yang", "Su Wu", "Tilo Pfeifer", "Klaus Hense"], "keywords": ["Context modeling", "Educational institutions", "Fuzzy logic", "Mathematical model", "Production", "Response surface methodology", "US Department of Energy", "design of experiments", "fuzzy logic", "fuzzy response", "multi-criteria system", "overall quality", ""], "arnumber": "6075954"}
