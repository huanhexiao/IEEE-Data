This paper presents an experimental study on the behavior of short concrete filled steel tubular columns (CFT) axially loaded in compression to failure. A total of 28 specimens (16 were filled with concrete and 12 were kept hollow) with different cross-sections were tested to investigate the load capacity. The length-to-diameter ratios of these columns were between 4 and 9. Parameters for the tests were tube shape and diameter-to-thickness ratio. Some of the concrete filled columns had internal bracing of #3 deformed bars. The test results are compared with the theoretical results and previous studies. The results show that the confinement effect on concrete does play a role in increasing the compressive strengths to almost 60% in some cases. Based on the test results, an equation to estimate the ultimate axial compressive loading capacities is also proposed for square CFT columns.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "657", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "666", "date_publication": "Dec. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "657 - 666"}, "authors": ["Muhammad Naseem Baig", "Jiansheng Fan", "Jianguo Nie"], "keywords": ["Concrete", "Electron tubes", "Equations", "Shape", "Steel", "Strain", "Stress", "axial load", "concrete filled tubes", "confinement", "internal bracing", "strength", ""], "arnumber": "6075951"}
