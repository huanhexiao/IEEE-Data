A new production process determining method that focuses on sustainable manufacturing was developed based on case-based reasoning, expert systems, and feature technology for designing the process flow of a new component. This study matches a new component with preview case process information, modifies the case process information if necessary, and selects the process flow for the new component based on a sustainable development assessment according to the similarities between the case and the sustainable development characteristics. The feasibility and practicability of the method is verified by a case study of a machining process flow design for a new component.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "693", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "700", "date_publication": "Dec. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "693 - 700"}, "authors": ["Xianchun Tan", "Fei Liu", "Dacheng Liu", "Li Zheng", "Haiying Wang", "Yihua Zhang"], "keywords": ["Machining", "Materials", "Optimization", "Planning", "Process planning", "Sustainable development", "diagnosis", "process planning", "process routing", "sustainable development", ""], "arnumber": "6075955"}
