The accelerations and the structure deformations from simulations were compared. It can be concluded that the pole side impact focuses primarily on side structure crashworthiness as a result of large intrusions, while the MOB side impact focuses primarily on full side structure crashworthiness. Accordingly, occupant protection strategies focus on different aspects to improve side impact safety. In the pole side impact the objective is to maintain the passenger compartment and protect the passenger's head from impacting the pole, while in the MDB side impact the objective is to protect the full human body. In the design of the car side structures, at least these two tests should be considered for assessing their side impact crashworthiness. Conducting these two side impact tests as certified tests provides insights into car safety during side impacts.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "725", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "730", "date_publication": "Dec. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "725 - 730"}, "authors": ["Dazhi Wang", "Guang Dong", "Jinhuan Zhang", "Shilin Huang"], "keywords": ["Acceleration", "Accidents", "Deformable models", "Finite element methods", "Safety", "Vehicle crash testing", "Vehicles", "car", "crashworthiness", "finite element simulation", "pole side impact", "side impact", ""], "arnumber": "6075959"}
