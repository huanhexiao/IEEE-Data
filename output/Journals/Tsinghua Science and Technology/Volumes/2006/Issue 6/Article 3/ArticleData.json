Many devices in active, hybrid, and semi-active structural control systems which are used as controllable force devices are costly to build and maintain. The passive control reinforced concrete frame (PCRCF) reinforced with high strength steel only in the columns presented here provides structural systems more resistance to lateral earthquake loadings at comparatively lower cost. The effectiveness is demonstrated by a nonlinear static analysis using fiber model for a single story single bay frame. The study shows that the use of high performance steel in columns prevents formation of plastic hinges at the critical column base sections and failures are always initiated by reinforcement yielding at the beam ends. Furthermore, after experiencing severe lateral drift, the passive control design has small residual displacements compared to ordinary reinforced concrete frames. PCRCF rehabilitation and strengthening can be achieved more easily as compared with ordinary reinforced concrete frame.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "640", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "647", "date_publication": "Dec. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "640 - 647"}, "authors": ["Asad Ullah Qazi", "Lieping Ye", "Xinzheng Lu"], "keywords": ["Concrete", "Earthquakes", "Plastics", "Steel", "Strain", "Structural beams", "earthquake", "failure mechanism", "high strength reinforcement", "passive control", "residual displacement", ""], "arnumber": "6075949"}
