Specifically, the empirical study analyzes the HSI of low-priced housing in Beijing. The results show that the HSI model is valid and the customer satisfaction theory can effectively analyze the housing industry. The results can help illustrate the factors which most affect customer satisfaction, and can be used to not only enhance the quality of homes and promote the housing market, but also to improve the standard of living for lower income people and provide suggestions to policy makers.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "667", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "674", "date_publication": "Dec. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "667 - 674"}, "authors": ["Song Yang", "Yan Zhu"], "keywords": ["Companies", "Customer satisfaction", "Data models", "Equations", "Indexes", "Industries", "Mathematical model", "customer satisfaction", "industry", "household satisfaction", "housing industry", "housing market", "housing product", ""], "arnumber": "6075952"}
