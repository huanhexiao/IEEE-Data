The modelling is then either with the equilibrium or dispersion model, whereas in the latter the dispersion coefficient accounts for all hydrodynamic non-idealities. A new approach uses single droplet experiments to obtain the basic laws and functions governing droplet breakage, coalescence, relative velocity, and axial dispersion when using droplet populance balance models (DPBM). The hydrodynamics simulation results show that the mean Sauter diameter, hold-up, and concentration profiles could be well predicted, which promotes the use of DPBM models for further applications in industrial scale.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "212", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "216", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "212 - 216"}, "authors": ["Hans-Jorq Bart"], "keywords": ["Correlation", "Dispersion", "Equations", "Geometry", "Hydrodynamics", "Mathematical model", "Solvents", "column design", "countercurrent extraction", "droplet populance balance model", "single droplet", ""], "arnumber": "6075877"}
