The catalyst concentration greatly influences various aspects of the direct organosilane synthesis process, including the reaction rate, the selectivity, and the silicon conversion. The reaction activity and the silicon conversion increase as the catalyst concentration increases. However, the reaction selectivity decreases for the catalyst concentrations more than 9 wt. %. The cross-sections of deactivated contact mass particles were observed by optical microscopy and analyzed by scanning electron microscope combined with energy dispersive X-ray detector (SEM-EDX). The observations showed that a textured substance formed on the original flat surface of the silicon particles after deactivation with copper only in a shallow surface layer of the contact mass. This indicates that the copper diffusion is the rate limiting step which causes the reaction deactivation.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "252", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "258", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "252 - 258"}, "authors": ["Wuxi Luo", "Guoliang Zhang", "Guangrun Wang", "Jinfu Wang"], "keywords": ["Copper", "Impurities", "Inductors", "Scanning electron microscopy", "Silicon", "Surface resistance", "copper concentration", "direct process", "online gas chromatogram (GC)", "reaction activity", "reaction selectivity", "scanning electron microscope combined with energy dispersive X-ray detector (SEM-EDX)", "silicon conversion", ""], "arnumber": "6075884"}
