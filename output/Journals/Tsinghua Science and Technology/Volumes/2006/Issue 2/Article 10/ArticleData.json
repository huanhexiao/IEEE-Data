In the integrated approach, the development of a solvent extraction (SX) flow sheet is done in the following order: 1) Definition of the process: composition of the feed, specification of the product, minimum yield, etc.; 2) Selection of the solvent(s) and studying its chemical and physical properties; 3) Design of the optimal flow sheet using a computer simulation; and 4) Combination of process definition and the results of both the simulation and the laboratory experiments for every battery yields the right type of equipment. Experimental proof of the recommended flow sheet, in the adequate equipment, follows-first in a bench-scale, and then in a full scale pilot or demonstration plant. Following of these simple rules ensures a successful development of the process.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "207", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "211", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "207 - 211"}, "authors": ["Baruch Grinbaum"], "keywords": ["Batteries", "Feeds", "Industrial plants", "Kinetic theory", "Laboratories", "Solvents", "Temperature measurement", "integrated approach", "simulation", "solvent extraction", ""], "arnumber": "6075876"}
