In this paper, the recent developments in both fundamental research and industrial application are briefly reviewed: (1) the development and application of Theory of Countercurrent Extraction, (2) the novel solvent extraction process and its application in industry for separating heavy rare earth elements (Tm, Vb, Lu), yttrium (Y), and scandium (Sc), (3) the on-line analysis and automatic control of countercurrent extraction, (4) the eco-friendly process for REfTh separation of bastnasite in Sichuan Province and electrochemical process for Eu/RE separation, and (5) the optimized flowcharts for typical rare earth minerals in China.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "241", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "247", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "241 - 247"}, "authors": ["Chunhua Yan", "Jianqtao Jia", "Chunsheng Liao", "Sheng Wu", "Guangxian Xu"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Heuristic algorithms", "Ions", "Object oriented modeling", "Process control", "Solvents", "Yttrium", "automation", "countercurrent extraction", "eco-friendly process", "on-line analysis", "rare earth separation", "solvent extraction", ""], "arnumber": "6075882"}
