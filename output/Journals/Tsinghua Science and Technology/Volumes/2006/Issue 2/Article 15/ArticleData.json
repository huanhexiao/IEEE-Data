These adsorbents generally have significantly high metal uptake capacities, good physical-chemical stabilities, and well-designed pore geometries compared to other pre-existing metalchelating ceramic-based adsorbents. This work describes the synthesis and evaluation of pyrazole and calix[4]arene crown adsorbents for selective separation of platinum, palladium, and gold and cesium ions, respectively, from solutions. These materials exhibit mesoporous properties with high surface areas and pore volumes. The sol-gel synthesis starting with precursor silanes and titania results in gel particles of desired pore characteristics and high capacity and stability. Characterization studies, such as adsorption isotherms, breakthrough curves for fixed bed operation, and material stability, show promising results for applications to metal sepation.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "233", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "240", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "233 - 240"}, "authors": ["L.
