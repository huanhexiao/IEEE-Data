The first one is the centrifugal liquid membrane (ClM) method combined with a conventional circular dichroism (CD) spectropolarimetry and the second one is a more interfacial specific second harmonic generation CD (SHG-CD) spectrometry. In the ClM-CD method, a cylindrical glass cell containing small amounts of organic and aqueous phases was rotated at about 7000 rlmin in a sample chamber of a CD spectropolarimeter to generate an interface with a high specific interfacial area between the two-phase liquid membranes. The CD spectra of the J-aggregate of protonated 5,10,15, 20-tetraphenylporphyrin formed at the toluene-sulfuric acid interface have been measured. As for the SHG-CD, a circularly polarized wavelength-variable fs-Iaser system was constructed to measure the interfacial SHG spectra of a flat liquid-liquid interface. The ion-associated aggregation of a water-soluble anionic porphyrin promoted with a cationic amphiphile at the heptane-water interface was observed by this technique and the observed SHG-CD spectra proved the generation of a characteristic optical activity accompanied by the formation of the interfacial aggregate of inherently achiral porphyrin molecules. These methods will pioneer a new field of interfacial chiral chemistry in the studies of solvent extraction mechanisms.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "228", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "232", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "228 - 232"}, "authors": ["Hitoshi Wataraj", "Sayaka Wada", "Kazuhiko Fujiwara"], "keywords": ["Aggregates", "Biomedical optical imaging", "Nonlinear optics", "Optical harmonic generation", "Optical polarization", "Optical sensors", "Optical variables measurement", "centrifugal liquid membrane", "chiral aggregation", "liquid-liquid interface", "second harmonic generation circular dichroism", "spectroscopic detection", ""], "arnumber": "6075880"}
