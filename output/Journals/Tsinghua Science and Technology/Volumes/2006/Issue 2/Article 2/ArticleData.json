The first commercial process using solvent extraction for the refining of the platinum-group metals was in South Africa. More recently, the Southern African region has seen the implementation of solvent extraction for other base metals, precious metals, and specialty metals. These include the world firsts of primary production of zinc at Skorpion Zinc in Namibia and the large-scale refining of gold by Harmony Gold in South Africa. Several other flowsheets that use solvent-extraction technology are currently under commissioning, development, or feasibility study for implementation in this part of the world, including those for the recovery of copper, cobalt, nickel, tantalum, and niobium.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "153", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "159", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "153 - 159"}, "authors": ["Peter M.
