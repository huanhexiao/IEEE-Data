The differences between primitive and non-primitive electrolyte models are demonstrated. Some new thermodynamic models for electrolyte solutions based on the mean spherical approximation and perturbation theory are introduced. An extended scaled-particle theory and modified CleggPitzer equation are presented for physical and chemical absorption processes with mixed solvents, respectively. A pseudo one-component two-Yukawa equation of state is used for the aqueous two-phase extraction process in charged colloidal systems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "181", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "187", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "181 - 187"}, "authors": ["Yigui Li"], "keywords": ["Absorption", "Chemicals", "Electric potential", "Electrostatics", "Equations", "Mathematical model", "Solvents", "Clegg-Pitzer equation", "aqueous two-phase extraction", "chemical absorption", "mean spherical approximation", "physical absorption", "primitive and non-primitive electrolyte models", "scaled-particle theory", "two-Yukawa potential", ""], "arnumber": "6075872"}
