There is also a trend to use copper stripping solutions with less acid than typically used in recent years. Cognis has developed a model that accurately predicts the copper strip point for virtually any copper solvent extraction reagent or combination of reagents under a wide variety of conditions. The equilibrium strip points for several well known commercial copper solvent extraction reagents are given as a function of reagent concentration, the copper and acid concentration of the strip aqueous, and the temperature. It is shown that the equilibrium strip point is not a straight line function of reagent concentration and that the equilibrium strip point increases with an increase in temperature. Copper extraction also increases as the temperature increases.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "160", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "164", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "160 - 164"}, "authors": ["Gary Kordosky", "Michael Virnig", "Burrel Boley"], "keywords": ["Copper", "Integrated circuit modeling", "Mixers", "Predictive models", "Solvents", "Strips", "Temperature distribution", "bioleaching process", "equilibrium strip point", "solvent extraction plants", ""], "arnumber": "6075869"}
