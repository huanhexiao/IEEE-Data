The copolymer recycling and partitioning behavior of penicillin V has been studied in this system. Results show that the copolymer could be purified and recycled and penicillin V of the filtrated ferment broth could be partitioned unevenly among the phases and purified in the top phase of this TES. About 90 wt.% of penicillin V could be distributed into the top phase around pH 2.5 and only less than 0.1 wt. % left in the bottom phase.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "248", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "251", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "248 - 251"}, "authors": ["Shufeng Shen", "Zhidong Chang", "Xinghua Sun", "Xin Hu", "Huizhou Liu"], "keywords": ["Barium", "Compounds", "Polyethylene", "Recycling", "USA Councils", "Water conservation", "block copolymer", "phenoxymethyl penicillin", "recovery", "three-liquid-phase extraction system", ""], "arnumber": "6075883"}
