The Center for the Development of Nuclear Technology-CDTN has been investigating alternative ways to supply the nuclear industry in order to improve the industrial processes. Some case study examples are presented, Emulsion from Uranium Solvent Extraction Plant and Itataia Uranium Developments. In Caitite industrial plant the water recirculation has caused continuous changes in the composition of pregnant liquor mainly in the sulfate and chloride concentrations. After some water recirculation cycles, a decrease in the uranium extraction efficiency was noted which was followed by the formation of stable emulsion at the uranium extraction stage. Itataia Uranium Developments were performed in a pilot plant for Itataia ore. This ore has the uranium mineral associated to the phosphate. The process consists of four main steps: 1) phosphate concentration, 2) chemical digestion of the concentrate to produce phosphoric acid with dissolved uranium, 3) uranium recovery, and 4) phosphoric acid purification by solvent extraction.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "217", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "221", "date_publication": "April 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "217 - 221"}, "authors": ["Jeaneth dos S.
