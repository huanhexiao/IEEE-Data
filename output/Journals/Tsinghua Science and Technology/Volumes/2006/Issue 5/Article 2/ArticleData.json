This paper presents an analytical model for predicting cutting forces in hard turning of 51 CrV4 with hardness of 68 HRC. The cutting tool used is made from cubic boron nitride (CBN) with a wiper cutting edge. Formulas for differential chip loads are derived for three different situations, depending on the radial depth of cut. The cutting forces are determined by integrating the differential cutting forces over the tool-workpiece engagement domain. For validation, cutting forces predicted by the model were compared with experimental measurements, and most of the results agree quite well.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "501", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "506", "date_publication": "Oct. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "501 - 506"}, "authors": ["Xinfeng He", "Su Wu", "Kratz Hubert"], "keywords": ["Calibration", "Cutting tools", "Feeds", "Force", "Mathematical model", "Predictive models", "Turning", "force prediction", "hard turning", "wiper tool cutting edge", ""], "arnumber": "6075927"}
