This paper describes an SCSI interface disk array, which is controlled by a simulated target controller, as the target device of an SAN system. A detailed target-mode SCSI middle level design and implementation is described with interfaces to efficiently supervise the entire target simulator. The target simulator has control flexibility, wide applicability, reduced SAN system cost, and compatibility with current SAN systems. The present mass data storage system uses a 2-Gb/s fiber network. Performance and compatibility tests demonstrate the efficiency of the target simulator design.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "589", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "596", "date_publication": "Oct. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "589 - 596"}, "authors": ["Bigang Li", "Jiwu Shu", "Weimin Zheng"], "keywords": ["Finite element methods", "Kernel", "Optical fiber devices", "Optical fiber networks", "Protocols", "Storage area networks", "Time domain analysis", "SCSI", "fiber channel", "storage area networks (SAN)", "target simulator", ""], "arnumber": "6075939"}
