Although there is demand for small spacecraft propulsion, the number of missions at present is small due to several commercial and technical reasons. Poor performance of existing small spacecraft propulsion systems is one of the main reasons for the small number of missions. Several reasons are given for the poor performance of existing small spacecraft propulsion. Suggested improvements focus on small spacecraft and propulsion hardware mass optimization rather than on specific impulse enhancement. Propellantless propulsion systems are also recommended for small spacecraft interplanetary missions.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "507", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "514", "date_publication": "Oct. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "507 - 514"}, "authors": ["Zakirov Vadim", "Luming Li"], "keywords": ["Nitrogen", "Orbits", "Payloads", "Propulsion", "Satellites", "Space vehicles", "payload", "performance enhancement", "propulsion", "small spacecraft", ""], "arnumber": "6075928"}
