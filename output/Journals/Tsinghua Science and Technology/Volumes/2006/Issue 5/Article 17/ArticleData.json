After the system was taught to recognize the size data, the system correctly recognized the size of series of cocoon filaments as much as 96.95% of the time for a single series and 98.72% of the time for the mean of two series. The correct recognition rate was higher after suitable filtering. The theory and method can be used to analyze other types of non-stationary finite length time series.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "611", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "616", "date_publication": "Oct. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "611 - 616"}, "authors": ["Wanchun Fei", "Lun Bai"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Character recognition", "Educational institutions", "Mathematical model", "Stochastic processes", "Time series analysis", "non-stationarity", "pattern recognition", "size series of cocoon filaments", "time series analysis", ""], "arnumber": "6075942"}
