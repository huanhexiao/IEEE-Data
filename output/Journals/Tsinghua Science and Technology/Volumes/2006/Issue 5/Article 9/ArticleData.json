Hydrogen recombiners and igniters are two methods to reduce hydrogen levels in containment buildings during severe accidents. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the safety implementation of hydrogen igniters and recombiners. This paper analyzes the risk of deliberate hydrogen ignition and investigates three mitigation measures using igniters only, hydrogen recombiners only or a combination of recombiners and igniters. The results indicate that steam can effectively control the hydrogen flame acceleration and the deflagration-to-detonation transition.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "549", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "558", "date_publication": "Oct. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "549 - 558"}, "authors": ["Jianjun Xiao", "Zhiwei Zhou", "Xingqing Jing"], "keywords": ["Acceleration", "Accidents", "Clouds", "Fires", "Hydrogen", "Ignition", "Indexes", "containment", "deflagration-to-detonation transition", "flame acceleration", "hydrogen mitigation", "nuclear power plant", "severe accident management", ""], "arnumber": "6075934"}
