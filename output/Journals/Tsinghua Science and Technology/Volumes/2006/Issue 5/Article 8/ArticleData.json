The algorithm took advantage of an efficient on-board database and an original \u201c4-star matching\u201d pattern recognition strategy to achieve fast and reliable star identification. The on-board database was composed of a brightness independent guide star catalog (mission catalog) and a K-vector star pair catalog. The star pattern recognition method involved direct location of star pair candidates and a simple array matching procedure. Tests of the algorithm with a CMOS active pixel sensor (APS) star tracker result in a 99.9% success rate for star identification for lost-in-space 3-axis attitude acquisition when the angular measurement accuracy of the star tracker is at least 0.010. The brightness independent algorithm requires relatively higher measurement accuracy of the star apparent positions that can be easily achieved by CCD or CMOS sensors along with subpixel centroiding techniques.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "543", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "548", "date_publication": "Oct. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "543 - 548"}, "authors": ["Ying Dong", "Fei Xing", "Zheng You"], "keywords": ["Brightness", "CMOS integrated circuits", "Catalogs", "Charge coupled devices", "Databases", "Pattern recognition", "Position measurement", "active pixel sensor (APS)", "attitude acquisition", "lost-in-space", "star identification", "star tracker", ""], "arnumber": "6075933"}
