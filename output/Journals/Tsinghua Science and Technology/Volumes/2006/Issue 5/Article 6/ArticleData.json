The flexible parameter adjustment ability and the computation speed of the digital signal processor were used to develop a new calibration procedure to determine the scale factor of a gyroscope without a turntable. The force of gravity was used to deflect the movable masses in the sensor, which resulted in a corresponding angular rate input. The gyroscope scale factor was then measured without a turntable. Test results show a maximum deviation of about 1.20/0 with respect to the scale factor determined on a turntable with the accuracy independent of the manufacturing process and property variations. The calibration method in combination with the improved readout electronics can minimize the calibration procedure and, thus, reduce the manufacturing costs.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "533", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "537", "date_publication": "Oct. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "533 - 537"}, "authors": ["Gaisser Alexander", "Zhongyu Gao", "Bin Zhou", "Rong Zhang", "Zhiyong Chen"], "keywords": ["Calibration", "Gravity", "Gyroscopes", "Oscillators", "Sensors", "Voltage measurement", "calibraticn", "digital readout", "gyroscope", "micro-machined angular rate sensor", "scale factor", ""], "arnumber": "6075931"}
