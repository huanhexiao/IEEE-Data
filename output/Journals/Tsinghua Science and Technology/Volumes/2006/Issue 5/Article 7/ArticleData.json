The approximate analytical solution for the dynamic transmissibility of the isolator was deduced by combining Fourier transforms and the harmonic balance method with deterministic excitation. The mathematical characteristics of the dynamic transmissibility were analyzed to illustrate the dynamic performance of the isolator. The analytical results show multiple solutions, especially the low-frequency attenuation characteristics below the resonance frequency. The results provide a theoretical basis for the design of nonlinear isolators.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "538", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "542", "date_publication": "Oct. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "538 - 542"}, "authors": ["Yang Ping", "Yang Jianming", "Jianning Ding"], "keywords": ["Acceleration", "Couplings", "Damping", "Isolators", "Mathematical model", "Vehicle dynamics", "Vibrations", "complex nonlinear coupling isolator", "mathematical model", "transmissibility", "vibrations", ""], "arnumber": "6075932"}
