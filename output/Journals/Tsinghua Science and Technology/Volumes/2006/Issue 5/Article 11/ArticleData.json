A joint maximum-likelihood (ML) and minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) channel estimation scheme was developed for more precise channel estimates based on the assumption of exponential multipath decay. The performance improvement was analyzed theoretically with a computer simulation using IEEE 802.15.3a ultra-wideband channel models. Theoretical and simulation results show that the scheme further improves the estimation performance of channel gains and multipath delays compared with the traditional ML channel estimator.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "568", "volume": "11", "lastpage": "573", "date_publication": "Oct. 2006", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2006", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "568 - 573"}, "authors": ["Lei Zhou", "Shidong Zhou", "Van Yao"], "keywords": ["Channel estimation", "Channel models", "Delay", "Joints", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Noise", "IEEE 802.15.3a", "channel estimation", "maximum-likelihood", "minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE)", "prior statistical knowledge", "ultra wideband (UWB)", ""], "arnumber": "6075936"}
