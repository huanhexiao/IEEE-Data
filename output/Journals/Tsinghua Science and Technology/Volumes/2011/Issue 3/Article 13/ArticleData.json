Decision makers often discover that a task assignment which is optimal with respect to a deterministic or stochastic/fuzzy model yields quite poor performance in reality. In real environments, assembly line balancing robustness is a more appropriate decision selection guide. A robust model based on the a worst case scenario is developed to compensate for the drawbacks of traditional robust criteria. A robust genetic algorithm is used to solve the problem. Comprehensive computational experiments to study the effect of the solution procedure show that the model generates more flexible robust solutions. Careful tuning the value of a allows the decision maker to balance robustness and conservativeness of assembly line task element assignments.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "308", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "314", "date_publication": "June 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "308 - 314"}, "authors": ["Weida Xu", "Tianyuan Xiao"], "keywords": ["Assembly", "Computational modeling", "Data models", "Genetic algorithms", "Optimization", "Robustness", "assembly line balancing", "genetic algorithm", "mixed model", "robust", "scenario planning", ""], "arnumber": "6078005"}
