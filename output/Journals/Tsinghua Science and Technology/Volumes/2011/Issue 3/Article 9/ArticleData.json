The new offset averaging design technique takes full advantage of traditional DC-coupled resistance averaging and AC-coupled capacitance averaging techniques to minimize offset-induced ADC nonlinearities. Circuit analysis allows selection of optimum resistance and capacitance averaging factors to achieve maximum offset reduction in ADC designs. The new averaging method is verified in designing a 4 bit 1 Gs/s flash ADC that is implemented in foundry 0.13 \u03bcrn CMOS technology.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "285", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "289", "date_publication": "June 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "285 - 289"}, "authors": ["Fan Siqiang", "He Tang", "Hui Zhao", "Xin Wang", "Albert Wang", "Bin Zhao", "Gary G Zhang"], "keywords": ["CMOS integrated circuits", "CMOS technology", "Capacitance", "Capacitors", "Resistance", "Resistors", "USA Councils", "analog-to-digital converter", "capacitor averaging", "flash analog-to-digital converters (ADC)", "integrated circuit (IC)", "offset averaging", "resistor averaging", ""], "arnumber": "6078001"}
