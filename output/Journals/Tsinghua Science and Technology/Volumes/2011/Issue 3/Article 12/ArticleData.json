Both the classical and Bayesian estimators are derived to mitigate the adverse effects caused by the CEE. Power scheduling among sensors and the power ratio between the training and data transmission at each individual node are optimized by directly minimizing the final average mean squared error to compensate for the CEE. A closed-form power scheduling policy is given for a homogeneous environment, which shows that more than 50% of the power should be allocated to sensor observation transmissions. For an inhomogeneous environment, a multilevel waterfilling type solution is developed for the power scheduling among sensors for only the sum power constraint with a \u201ccave\u201d waterfilling solution for both the sum and individual power constraints. Simulations show that the proposed power scheduling schemes achieve better performance than the equal power scheduling scheme.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "300", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "307", "date_publication": "June 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "300 - 307"}, "authors": ["Li Zhang", "Tao Cui", "Xianda Zhang"], "keywords": ["Channel estimation", "Maximum likelihood estimation", "Nonhomogeneous media", "Optimized production technology", "Signal to noise ratio", "Training", "distributed estimation", "distributed signal processing", "power scheduling", "sensor networks", ""], "arnumber": "6078004"}
