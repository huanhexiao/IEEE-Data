A universal method is developed here to handle both Gaussian and compound Poisson white noise. The quadratic variations are analyzed to transform the problem into a Lyapunov matrix differential equation. Explicit formulas are then derived by vectorization. These formulas are applied to a simple model of flows and queuing in a computer network. A stability analysis of the mean value illustrates the effects of oscillations in a real system. The relationships between the oscillations and the parameters are clearly presented to improve designs of real systems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "264", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "271", "date_publication": "June 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "264 - 271"}, "authors": ["Hua Fan", "Xiuming Shan", "Jian Yuan", "Yang Ren"], "keywords": ["Compounds", "Covariance matrix", "Differential equations", "Equations", "Mathematical model", "Noise", "Oscillators", "compound Poisson white noise", "covariance matrix", "stochastic differential equation (SDE)", "transmission control protocol (TCP) flow", ""], "arnumber": "6077998"}
