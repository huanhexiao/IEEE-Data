The network architecture, activation functions, and training method were encoded as individuals with an appropriate method for individual selection. The immune feedforward neural network is then applied to fault detection of water quality monitoring equipment. This gives better performance than a feedforward neural network.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "272", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "277", "date_publication": "June 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "272 - 277"}, "authors": ["Xiaoping Chen", "He Huang"], "keywords": ["Fault detection", "Feedforward neural networks", "Immune system", "Monitoring", "Probability", "Training", "artificial neural network (ANN)", "fault detection", "immune algorithm", ""], "arnumber": "6077999"}
