These collinear polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) transducers were specially designed for the handwriting input system to give a large writeable area with writing in any direction. Driver and detection circuits were developed for the handwriting system. This handwriting input system based on 2-dimensional position tracing has large writeable area (A4 paper), low drive voltage (5 V), and is independent of the handwriting pad or the pen.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "290", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "294", "date_publication": "June 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "290 - 294"}, "authors": ["Yufeng Wang", "Yi Yang", "Xiangming Kong", "Wenjun Liao", "Ligang Wang", "Tianling Ren", "Litian Liu"], "keywords": ["Acoustics", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Driver circuits", "Gain", "Handwriting recognition", "Receivers", "Ultrasonic imaging", "PVDF", "collinear transducers", "driver and detection circuit", "handwriting input system", ""], "arnumber": "6078002"}
