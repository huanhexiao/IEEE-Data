Speech quality is most affected by residual bit errors in received speech frames. Conventional methods use binary decision strategies for error detection and concealment in frames. This paper presents a multi-level error detection and concealment algorithm for GSM full rate speech codec systems. The algorithm uses multi-source knowledge to detect and conceal speech frame errors at the frame, parameter, and even bit levels. Tests show that most corrupted frames can be appropriately concealed by this algorithm, resulting in MOS gains of more than 50% for real-world data tests.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "247", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "255", "date_publication": "June 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "247 - 255"}, "authors": ["Linfang Wang", "Jia Liu", "Xiaoqing Liu", "Ming Li"], "keywords": ["Codecs", "GSM", "Mobile communication", "Redundancy", "Speech", "Speech coding", "error concealment", "error detection", "global system for mobile (GSM)", "speech coding", "speech quality", ""], "arnumber": "6077996"}
