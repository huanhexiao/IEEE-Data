The analysis first converts the SPP into a problem of searching for equilibriums of a dynamic system using a criterion for solutions of the SPP, then shows the existence and uniqueness of the solutions by creating a positive function whose Fr\u00e9chet derivative is decreasing along any solution. The construction of positively invariant subsets gives the global stability and convergence of this dynamic system, that is, the dynamic system globally converges to some exact solution of the SPP. Finally, the paper also shows that the obtained results can be applied to neural computing for solving SPP.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "315", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "319", "date_publication": "June 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "315 - 319"}, "authors": ["Xisheng Shen", "Xiaofang Wang", "Yueting Chai"], "keywords": ["Circuit stability", "Convergence", "Educational institutions", "Hilbert space", "Optimization", "Stability criteria", "global stability", "minimax problem", "saddle point problems (SPP)", ""], "arnumber": "6078006"}
