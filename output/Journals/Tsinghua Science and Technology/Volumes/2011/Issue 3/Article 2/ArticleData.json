This paper describes an integrated framework for modeling virtual humans with a high level of autonomy. The framework seeks to reproduce human-like believable behavior and movement in virtual humans in a virtual environment. The framework includes a visual and auditory information perception module, a decision network based behavior decision module, and a hierarchical autonomous motion control module. These cooperate to model realistic autonomous individual behavior for virtual humans in real-time interactive virtual environments. The framework was tested in a simulated virtual environment system to demonstrate the ability of the framework to create autonomous, perceptive and intelligent virtual humans in real-time virtual environments.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "233", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "240", "date_publication": "June 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "233 - 240"}, "authors": ["Weibin Liu", "Liang Zhou", "Weiwei Xing", "Xingqi Liu", "Baozong Yuan"], "keywords": ["Animation", "Computational modeling", "Decision making", "Heuristic algorithms", "Humans", "Real time systems", "Virtual environments", "autonomous behavior", "behavior decision", "character animation", "motion planning", "obstacle avoidance", "virtual human", ""], "arnumber": "6077994"}
