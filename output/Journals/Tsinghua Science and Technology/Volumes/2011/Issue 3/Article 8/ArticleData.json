This paper also presents an automatic identification approach for customized instruction without input/output number constraints for multi-issue architectures. The approach identifies customized instructions using multiple attribute decision-making based on the analysis of several attributes for each candidate node. Tests indicate that the approach achieves higher speedup ratios than previous approaches, as well as less area cost. In addition, this approach provides designers with multiple candidate designs.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "278", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "284", "date_publication": "June 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "278 - 284"}, "authors": ["Honghe Tan", "Yihe Sun"], "keywords": ["Complexity theory", "Computer architecture", "Hardware", "Processor scheduling", "Registers", "Schedules", "VLIW", "customized instruction (CI)", "instruction set extension (ISE)", "multi-issue architecture", ""], "arnumber": "6078000"}
