State-of-the-art general purpose graphic processing units (GPGPU) were utilized to accelerate the processing. The implementation achieves much better performance than conventional processing systems, with a speedup of more than 890 times on NVIDIA Tesla C1060 supercomputing cards compared to an Intel P4 2.4 GHz CPU. 256\u00d7256 pixel images could be reconstructed within 6.3 s, which makes real-time imaging possible. Six platforms were tested and compared. The results show that the GPGPU super-computing system has great potential for radar image processing.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "256", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "263", "date_publication": "June 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "256 - 263"}, "authors": ["Bin Zhou", "Yingning Peng", "Chunmao Yeh", "Jun Tang"], "keywords": ["Convolution", "Graphics processing unit", "Image reconstruction", "Imaging", "Parallel processing", "Radar imaging", "convolution back projection (CBP)", "general purpose graphic processing units (GPGPU)", "inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR)", "synthetic aperture radar (SAR)", ""], "arnumber": "6077997"}
