The magnetic field energy, the magnetization distribution and the effective magnetic field were simulated for variable spacer distances, aspect ratios and external magnetic fields to study the interactions among the GMR sensors. And the spacer distance should be at least 1000 nm to eliminate interference between 1000 nm \u00d7 100 nm \u00d7 9 nm or larger GMRs in an array, while the aspect ratio should be more than 10 to improve the sensor sensitivity and stability. Micromagnetic energy theory is used to explain the simulation results.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "151", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "156", "date_publication": "April 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "151 - 156"}, "authors": ["Cong Yin", "Ze Jia", "Weichao Ma", "Tianling Ren"], "keywords": ["Arrays", "Biosensors", "Couplings", "Magnetic anisotropy", "Magnetic fields", "Magnetization", "Mathematical model", "biosensor", "giant magnetoresistance", "interaction", "micromagnetic", ""], "arnumber": "6077980"}
