However, the method has rarely been applied to face recognition. Aimed to develop a fast and efficient new feature for face recognition, the original HOG and its variations were applied to evaluate the effects of different factors. An information theory-based criterion was also developed to evaluate the potential classification power of different features. Comparative experiments show that even with a relatively simple feature descriptor, the proposed HOG feature achieves almost the same recognition rate with much lower computational time than the widely used Gabor feature on the FRGC and CAS-PEAL databases.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "216", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "224", "date_publication": "April 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "216 - 224"}, "authors": ["Chang Shu", "Xiaoqing Ding", "Chi Fang"], "keywords": ["Databases", "Face recognition", "Feature extraction", "Histograms", "Image edge detection", "Lighting", "Vectors", "face recognition", "feature", "histogram of oriented gradient", ""], "arnumber": "6077989"}
