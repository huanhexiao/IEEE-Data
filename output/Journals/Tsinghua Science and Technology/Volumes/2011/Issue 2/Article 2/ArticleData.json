In an audiovisual temporal order judgment paradigm, the reliability of the auditory signal was manipulated by Gaussian volume envelopes, introducing varying degrees of temporal uncertainty. While statistically optimal weighting according to the MLE rule was found in half of the participants, the other half consistently overweighted the auditory signal. The results are discussed in terms of a general auditory bias in time perception, interindividual differences, as well as in terms of the conditions and limits of statistically optimal multisensory integration.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "121", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "132", "date_publication": "April 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "121 - 132"}, "authors": ["M.
