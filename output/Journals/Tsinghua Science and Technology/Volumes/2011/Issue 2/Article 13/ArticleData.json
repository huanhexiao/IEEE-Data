With the security theory of conventional cryptology, encryption algorithms are made public while all the secrets are encoded only in the keys. This paper applies chaos theory to conventional cryptography to develop a one-time-one-algorithm design. A general theory is given to generate the clock key, substitution box, permutation box and operational sign functions for a one-time-one-algorithm scheme. This scheme is then implemented in a system to manage the tradeoff between speed and the security of the encryption algorithm.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "194", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "206", "date_publication": "April 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "194 - 206"}, "authors": ["Geng Zhao", "Guanrong Chen", "Jingqing Fang", "Gang Xu"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Chaos", "Clocks", "Encryption", "Public key", "block cipher", "chaotic cryptography", "one-time-one-algorithm", "one-time-one-key", ""], "arnumber": "6077987"}
