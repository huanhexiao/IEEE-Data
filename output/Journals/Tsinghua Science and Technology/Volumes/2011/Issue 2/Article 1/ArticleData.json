We argue that the formation of cross-modal referential links is a prerequisite for the occurrence of cross-modal interactions between vision and language. In this paper we examine a computational model for a cross-modal reference formation with respect to its robustness against conceptual underspecification in the visual modality. This investigation is motivated by the fact that natural systems are well capable of establishing a cross-modal reference between modalities with different degrees of conceptual specification. In the investigated model, conceptually underspecified context information continues to drive the syntactic disambiguation of verb-centered syntactic ambiguities as long as the visual context contains the situation arity information of the visual scene.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "113", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "120", "date_publication": "April 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "113 - 120"}, "authors": ["Patrick McCrae", "Wolfgang Menzel", "Maosong Sun"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Computational modeling", "Context", "Context modeling", "Pragmatics", "Syntactics", "Visualization", "cross-modal reference", "syntactic disambiguation", "vision-language interaction", ""], "arnumber": "6077975"}
