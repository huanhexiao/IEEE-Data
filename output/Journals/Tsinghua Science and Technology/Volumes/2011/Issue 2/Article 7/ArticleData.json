The ASIC having a charge sensitive amplifier and a semi-Gaussian pulse-shaper was produced using the CSMC 0.5 urn DPDM process. The ENC noise of 363 e at 0 pF with a noise slope of 23 e/pF complies with the stringent low noise requirements. The peaking time was 250 ns at a 100 mV/fC conversion gain (detector capacitance is 20 pF). By operating this frontend readout ASIC in the weak inversion region, the ultra-low power dissipation is only 0.1 mW/channel (3.0 V). Simulations and test results suggest that this design gives lower power consumption than the front-end readout ASICs working in the strong inversion and is appropriate for the portable digital radiation detectors.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "157", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "163", "date_publication": "April 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "157 - 163"}, "authors": ["Yunbo Zhou", "Yu Yang", "Yueer Shan", "Huafeng Cao", "Bing Yang", "Zongguang Yu"], "keywords": ["Application specific integrated circuits", "Bandwidth", "CMOS integrated circuits", "Capacitance", "Gain", "Noise", "Preamplifiers", "charge sensitive", "nested feedback loop", "readout circuit", "shaper", "weak inversion region", ""], "arnumber": "6077981"}
