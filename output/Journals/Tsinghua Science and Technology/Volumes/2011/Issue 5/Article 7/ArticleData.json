This paradigm empowers users to pervasively access a large volume of storage resources with portable devices in a distributed and cooperative manner. During the period between uploading and downloading files (data), the privacy and integrity of files need to be guaranteed. To this end, a family of schemes are proposed for different situations. All schemes are lightweight in terms of computational overhead, resilient to storage compromise on mobile devices, and do not assume that trusted cloud servers are present. Corresponding algorithms are proposed in detail for guiding off-the-shelf implementation. The evaluation of security and performance is also extensively analyzed, justifying the applicability of the proposed schemes.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "520", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "528", "date_publication": "Oct. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "520 - 528"}, "authors": ["Wei Ren", "Linchen Yu", "Ren Gao", "Feng Xiong"], "keywords": ["Cascading style sheets", "Cloud computing", "Encryption", "Mobile communication", "Outsourcing", "Portals", "integrity", "mobile cloud computing", "privacy", "storage security", ""], "arnumber": "6078036"}
