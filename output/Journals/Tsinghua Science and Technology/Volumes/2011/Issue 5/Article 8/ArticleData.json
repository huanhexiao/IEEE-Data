Address allocation information is maintained on the network border nodes, called addressing agents (AAs), which are locally identified by a geographic routing protocol GFG (Greedy-FACE-Greedy). When a node joins the network, it acquires an address from a neighboring AA (if any exists) by local communication or from the head AA (a geographic extreme AA) by GFG-based multi-hop communication. A Geographic Hash Table (GHT) is adopted for duplicate address detection. Each address is hashed to a unique location in the network field, and the associated assignment information is stored along the face perimeter enclosing that location (in the planar graph). When a node receives an address assignment, it consults with the perimeter nodes around the hash location of the assigned address about any conflicts. AAs detect network partitions and merger locally according to neighborhood change and trigger AA re-selection and network re-configuration (if necessary). We propose to apply a Connected Dominating Set (CDS) to improve the performance. We also evaluate LaConf through simulation using different planar graphs.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "529", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "538", "date_publication": "Oct. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "529 - 538"}, "authors": ["Xu Li", "Yanli Deng", "Amiya Nayak", "Ivan Stoimenovic", "Venkat Narasimhan"], "keywords": ["Corporate acquisitions", "Face", "Mobile ad hoc networks", "Resource management", "Routing", "Routing protocols", "Servers", "address autoconfiguration", "localized algorithms", "wireless ad hoc networks", ""], "arnumber": "6078037"}
