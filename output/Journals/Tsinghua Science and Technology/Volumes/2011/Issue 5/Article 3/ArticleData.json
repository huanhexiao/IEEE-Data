Power-constrained WSNs are usable as long as they can communicate sense data to a processing node. Poor communication links and hazardous environments make the WSNs unreliable. Existing schemes assume that the state of a sensor covering targets is binary: success (covers the targets) or failure (cannot cover the targets). However, in real WSNs, a sensor covers targets with a certain probability. To improve WSNs' reliability, we should consider that a sensor covers targets with users' satisfied probability. To solve this problem, this paper first introduces a failure probability into the target coverage problem to improve and control the system reliability. Furthermore, we model the solution as the \u03b1-Reliable Maximum Sensor Covers (\u03b1-RMSC) problem and design a heuristic greedy algorithm that efficiently computes the maximal number of \u03b1-Reliable sensor covers. To efficiently extend the WSNs lifetime with users' pre-defined failure probability requirements, only the sensors from the current active sensor cover are responsible for monitoring all targets, while all other sensors are in a low-energy sleep mode. Simulation results validate the performance of this algorithm, in which users can precisely control the system reliability without sacrificing much energy consumption.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "464", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "474", "date_publication": "Oct. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "464 - 474"}, "authors": ["Jing He", "Shouling Ji", "Yi Pan", "Yingshu Li"], "keywords": ["Energy efficiency", "Monitoring", "Probability", "Reliability", "Sensors", "Simulation", "Wireless sensor networks", "&#x003B1", "-reliable maximum sensor covers", "energy efficiency", "node failure", "sensor scheduling", "target coverage", "wireless sensor networks", ""], "arnumber": "6078032"}
