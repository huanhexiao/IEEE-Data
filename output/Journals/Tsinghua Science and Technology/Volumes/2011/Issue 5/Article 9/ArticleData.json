One such uncertainty is wireless communication itself which assumes complex spatial and temporal dynamics. For dependable and predictable performance, therefore, link estimation has become a basic element of wireless network routing. Several approaches using broadcast beacons and/or unicast MAC feedback have been proposed in the past years, but there is still no systematic characterization of the drawbacks and sources of errors in beacon-based link estimation in low-power wireless networks, which leads to ad hoc usage of beacons in routing. Using a testbed of 98 XSM motes (an enhanced version of MICA2 motes), we characterize the negative impact that link layer retransmission and traffic-induced interference have on the accuracy of beacon-based link estimation, and we show that data-driven link estimation and routing achieve higher event reliability (e.g., by up to 18.75%) and transmission efficiency (e.g., by up to a factor of 1.96) than beacon-based approaches. These findings provide solid evidence for the necessity of data-driven link estimation and demonstrate the importance of addressing the drawbacks of beacon-based link estimation when designing protocols for low-power wireless networks of cyber-physical systems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "539", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "552", "date_publication": "Oct. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "539 - 552"}, "authors": ["Hongwei Zhang"], "keywords": ["Correlation", "Estimation", "Interference", "Reliability", "Routing", "Unicast", "Wireless networks", "data-driven", "beacon-based", "link estimation and routing", "low-power wireless networks", "sensor networks", ""], "arnumber": "6078038"}
