We focus on the problem of virtual backbone construction in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks, where the coverage areas of the nodes are disks with identical radii. In the simulation, we show that the MAP-based giant component has the ability to connect most nodes and serves as a backbone in the network. The algorithm is localized and may play an important role in efficiently constructing a virtual backbone for ad hoc and sensor networks.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "553", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "558", "date_publication": "Oct. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "553 - 558"}, "authors": ["Pengfei Hu", "Kai Xing", "Liusheng Huang", "Yang Wang", "Dapeng Wang", "Pei Li"], "keywords": ["Ad hoc networks", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Educational institutions", "Mobile computing", "Wireless networks", "Wireless sensor networks", "ad hoc and sensor networks", "giant component", "maximal independent set", ""], "arnumber": "6078039"}
