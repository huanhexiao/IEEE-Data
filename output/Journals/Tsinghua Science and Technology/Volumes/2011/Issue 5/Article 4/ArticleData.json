However, the performance of these protocols is highly affected by the characteristics of the wireless channel and may be even inferior to the performance of single-path approaches. Specifically, when multiple adjacent paths are being used concurrently, the broadcast nature of wireless channels results in inter-path interference which significantly degrades end-to-end throughput. In this paper, we propose a LowInterference Energy-efficient Multipath Routing protocol (LIEMRO) to improve the QoS requirements of event-driven applications. In addition, in order to optimize resource utilization over the established paths, LIEMRO employs a quality-based load balancing algorithm to regulate the amount of traffic injected into the paths. The performance gain of LIEMRO compared to the ETX-based single-path routing protocol is 85%, 80%, and 25% in terms of data delivery ratio, end-to-end throughput, and network lifetime, respectively. Furthermore, the end-to-end latency is improved more than 60%.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "475", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "490", "date_publication": "Oct. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "475 - 490"}, "authors": ["Marjan Radi", "Behnam Dezfouli", "Kamalrulnizam Abu Bakar", "Shukor Abd Razak", "Mohammad Ali Nematbakhsh"], "keywords": ["Interference", "Quality of service", "Routing", "Routing protocols", "Wireless communication", "Wireless sensor networks", "LIEMRO", "QoS", "event-driven", "interference", "load balancing", "multipath routing", ""], "arnumber": "6078033"}
