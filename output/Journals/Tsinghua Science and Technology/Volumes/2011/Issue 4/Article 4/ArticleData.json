This distributed algorithm has very low computational complexity, so it is suitable for on-board processing. This algorithm improves the autonomous operating capability and throughput of satellite networks. Simulations show that the algorithm has better performance than the static sequent snap shots algorithm with acceptable low overhead signaling.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "358", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "363", "date_publication": "Aug. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "358 - 363"}, "authors": ["Jian Yan", "Yuan Zhang", "Zhigang Cao"], "keywords": ["Delay", "Low earth orbit satellites", "Real time systems", "Routing", "Satellite broadcasting", "Satellite constellations", "QoS", "low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation", "on-board processing", "routing", ""], "arnumber": "6078015"}
