Thermal behaviors of the designed BGA with Si interposer has been analyzed and compared to a conventional BGA with BT substrate in the approach of finite element modeling (FEM). The Si interposer with TSV was then fabricated and the designed BGA package was demonstrated. The designed BGA package includes a 1 00 urn thick Si interposer, which has redistribution copper traces on both sides. Through vias with 25 to 40 urn diameter were fabricated on the Si interposer using deep reactive ion etching (DRIE), plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), copper electroplating and chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), etc. TSV in the designed interposer is used as electrical interconnections and cooling channels. 5 mm by 5 mm and 10 mm by 10 mm thermal chips were assembled on the Si interposer.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "408", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "413", "date_publication": "Aug. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "408 - 413"}, "authors": ["Hao Zhang", "Jian Cai", "Qian Wang", "Tao Wang", "Shuidi Wang"], "keywords": ["Assembly", "Copper", "Electronic packaging thermal management", "Heat sinks", "Silicon", "Substrates", "Through-silicon vias", "Si interposer", "ball grid array (BGA)", "thermal modeling", "through silicon via (TSV)", ""], "arnumber": "6078022"}
