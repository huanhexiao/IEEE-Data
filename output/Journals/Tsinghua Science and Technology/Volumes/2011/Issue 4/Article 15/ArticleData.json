Evolutionary strategies, with their ability to have a global view of the structural information, have been shown to effectively improve performance. However, most of these methods consume too much measurement time. This paper introduces an ordinal optimization based strategy combined with a back propagation neural network for autotuning of the configuration parameters. The strategy was first proposed in the automation community for complex manufacturing system optimization and is customized here for improving distributed system performance. The method is compared with the covariance matrix algorithm. Tests using a real distributed system with three-tier servers show that the strategy reduces the testing time by 400/0 on average at a reasonable performance cost.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "440", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "448", "date_publication": "Aug. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "440 - 448"}, "authors": ["Fan Zhang", "Junwei Cao", "Lianchen Liu", "Cheng Wu"], "keywords": ["Computational modeling", "Noise", "Noise level", "Noise measurement", "Optimization", "Servers", "System performance", "autotune configuration parameters", "covariance matrix algorithm", "distributed systems", "ordinal optimization", "performance evaluation", ""], "arnumber": "6078026"}
