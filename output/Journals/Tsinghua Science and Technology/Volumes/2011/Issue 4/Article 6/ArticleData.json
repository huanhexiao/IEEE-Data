However, measurement noise such as phase noise in the local oscillators as well as additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) can result in significant errors in channel capacity estimates. This study analyzes the impact of phase noise and AWGN on channel capacity in TOMS-based MIMO measurements, with a channel capacity estimator presented that reduces the impact of noise on both the spatial multiplexing gain and on the power gain. Simulations demonstrate that the estimator consistently obtains the true capacity for various MIMO channel scenarios, even if only a limited number of observations are available.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "371", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "376", "date_publication": "Aug. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "371 - 376"}, "authors": ["Yuan Yao", "Jianfeng Zheng", "Zhenghe Feng"], "keywords": ["AWGN", "Channel capacity", "Channel estimation", "Estimation", "MIMO", "Multiplexing", "Signal to noise ratio", "channel capacity", "multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems", "phase noise", "power gain", "spatial multiplexing gain", ""], "arnumber": "6078017"}
