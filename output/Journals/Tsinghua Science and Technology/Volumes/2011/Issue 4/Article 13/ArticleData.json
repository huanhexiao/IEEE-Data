Providing application visibility as a core network function is challenging due to its performance requirements, including high throughput, low memory usage, and high identification accuracy. This paper presents a payload-based application identification method using a signature matching engine utilizing characteristics of the application identification. The solution uses two-stage matching and pre-classification to simultaneously improve the throughput and reduce the memory. Compared to a state-of-the-art common regular expression engine, this matching engine achieves 380/0 memory use reduction and triples the throughput. In addition, the solution is orthogonal to most existing optimization techniques for regular expression matching, which means it can be leveraged to further increase the performance of other matching algorithms.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "422", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "431", "date_publication": "Aug. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "422 - 431"}, "authors": ["Fei He", "Fan Xiang", "Yiyang Shao", "Yibo Xue", "Jun Li"], "keywords": ["Doped fiber amplifiers", "Engines", "Memory management", "Payloads", "Protocols", "Statistical analysis", "Throughput", "application identification", "deep inspection", "regular expression", "traffic classification", ""], "arnumber": "6078024"}
