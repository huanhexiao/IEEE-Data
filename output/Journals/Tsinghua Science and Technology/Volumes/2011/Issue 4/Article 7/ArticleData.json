This paper describes an online metric learning approach for a set of ranking functions. In the feedback round, the most relevant and most nonrelevant images related to the target image are selected to construct a relative comparison triplet. The weighting parameters of the multiple ranking functions are updated by minimizing a quadratic objective function constrained by the triplet. The approach unifies the learning algorithm for the most commonly used ranking functions. Thus, multiple features with their own ranking function can easily be employed in the ranking module without feature reconstruction. The method is computationally inexpensive and appropriate for large-scale e-commerce image retrieval applications. Customized ranking functions are well supported. Practically, simplified ranking functions yield better results when the number of query rounds is relatively small. Experiments with an image dataset from a real e-commerce platform show the superiority of the proposed approach.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "377", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "385", "date_publication": "Aug. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "377 - 385"}, "authors": ["Hong Gu", "Guangzhou Zhao", "Jun Qiu"], "keywords": ["Image retrieval", "Measurement", "Radio frequency", "Semantics", "Support vector machines", "Training", "Vectors", "image ranking", "metric learning", "relative comparison", "relevance feedback", ""], "arnumber": "6078018"}
