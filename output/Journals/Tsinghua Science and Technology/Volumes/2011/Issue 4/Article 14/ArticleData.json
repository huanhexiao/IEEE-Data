This paper proposes a novel packet classification algorithm optimized for multi-core network processors. The proposed algorithm, AggreCuts, has an explicit worst-case search time with modest memory usage. The data structure of AggreCuts is flexible and well-adapted to different types of multi-core platforms. The algorithm on both Intel IXP2850 32-bit and Cavium OCTEON3860 64-bit multi-core platforms was implemented to evaluate the performance of AggreCuts. The experimental results show that AggreCuts outperforms the best-known existing algorithm in terms of memory usage and classification speed.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "432", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "439", "date_publication": "Aug. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "432 - 439"}, "authors": ["Yaxuan Qi", "Yibo Xue", "Jun Li"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Arrays", "Classification algorithms", "Memory management", "Partitioning algorithms", "Program processors", "multi-core", "packet classification", "performance evaluation", ""], "arnumber": "6078025"}
