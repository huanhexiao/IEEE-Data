However, when porting the legacy parallel video encoders developed for clusters to shared-memory multi-cores, the existing parallel algorithms result in workload imbalances on different cores and communication inefficiencies. This paper describes a strip-wise parallel scheme to balance workloads and a hybrid communication mechanism to reduce communication overhead. The implementation of the H.264 parallel encoder on an eight CPU Intel Xeon system achieves 5\u00d7 to 6\u00d7 speed-up over a single thread encoder and achieves a 29% performance improvement over the commonly used master-slave schemes on clusters. The paper also gives further analysis on scalability, parallel efficiency, workload balance, and communication overhead as the number of cores varies.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "393", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "398", "date_publication": "Aug. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "393 - 398"}, "authors": ["Junli Gu", "Yihe Sun"], "keywords": ["Encoding", "Master-slave", "Message passing", "Multicore processing", "Program processors", "Streaming media", "Strips", "message passing", "parallel video encoder", "shared memory", "speed improvement", ""], "arnumber": "6078020"}
