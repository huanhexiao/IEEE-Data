This paper investigates whether those with less risk aversion or more risk aversion would like to be informed when there is private information which can be acquired for a certain cost. The CARA utility function and normal return assumptions were used to get the closed form solution of the absolute risk aversion coefficient which is indifferent to whether a person wants to be informed, which shows that the less risk aversion investor would like to be informed. The results further show that in financial markets, those people with lower risk aversion (for instance, institutional investors) are more favorable to information and price discovery of risky assets, which is consistent with intuition as well as empirical studies.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "69", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "73", "date_publication": "Feb. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "69 - 73"}, "authors": ["Jian Gao", "Lihong Zhang", "Fengming Song"], "keywords": ["Closed-form solutions", "Economics", "Educational institutions", "Finance", "Noise measurement", "Portfolios", "Random variables", "CARA utility", "information", "informed trader", "risk aversion", ""], "arnumber": "6077938"}
