The SoC included an application specific integrated circuit with a vector accelerator to improve performance. The sub-word model based on a continuous density hidden Markov model recognition algorithm ran on a very cheap speech chip. The algorithm was a two-stage fixed-width beam-search baseline system with a variable beam-width pruning strategy and a frame-synchronous word-level pruning strategy to significantly reduce the recognition time. Tests show that this method reduces the recognition time nearly 6 fold and the memory size nearly 2 fold compared to the original system, with less than 1 % accuracy degradation for a 600 word recognition task and recognition accuracy rate of about 98%.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "95", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "99", "date_publication": "Feb. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "95 - 99"}, "authors": ["Hong Liu", "Yanmin Qian", "Jia Liu"], "keywords": ["Hardware", "Hidden Markov models", "Mel frequency cepstral coefficient", "Speech", "Speech recognition", "System-on-a-chip", "Vocabulary", "mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC)", "non-specific human voice-consciousness", "system-on-chip", ""], "arnumber": "6077942"}
