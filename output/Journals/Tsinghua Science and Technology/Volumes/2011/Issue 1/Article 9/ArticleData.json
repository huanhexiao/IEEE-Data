However, the failure affected traffic may cause congestion if it is not carefully allocated over the backup paths according to their available capacity. A post failure traffic engineering (PostTE) scheme is proposed to balance the load in the PFR scheme. Loop-free backup paths are prepared in advance to cover all the potential single-link failures. The failure affected load is locally allocated to the backup paths through solving a linear programming (LP) problem. Most of the time, the maximum link utilization (MLU) of the network is minimized under both the failure and failure-free cases. For the tested education networks, the LP problem can be solved within milliseconds.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "55", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "61", "date_publication": "Feb. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "55 - 61"}, "authors": ["Mingui Zhang", "Bin Liu"], "keywords": ["Convergence", "IP networks", "Load management", "Network topology", "Optimization", "Routing", "Topology", "failure recovery", "linear programming", "routing", "traffic engineering", ""], "arnumber": "6077936"}
