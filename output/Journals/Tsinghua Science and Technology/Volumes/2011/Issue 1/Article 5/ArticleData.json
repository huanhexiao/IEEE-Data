The method overcomes the shortcomings of domestic fire alarm systems using single sensor information. Test results show that the identification error rates for fires, smoldering fires, and no fire are less than 50/0, which greatly reduces leak-check rates and false alarms. This neural network fire alarm system can fuse a variety of sensor data and improve the ability of systems to adapt in the environment and accurately predict fires, which has great significance for life and property safety.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "31", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "35", "date_publication": "Feb. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "31 - 35"}, "authors": ["Caixia Cheng", "Fuchun Sun", "Xinquan Zhou"], "keywords": ["Alarm systems", "Clustering algorithms", "Detectors", "Fires", "Radial basis function networks", "Training", "fire detection", "multi-sensor information fusion", "neural network", "simulation", ""], "arnumber": "6077932"}
