An efficient quantum shear sorting (QSS) algorithm is used to reduce the number of time steps. For the QSS algorithm, the running complexity of the quantum switching architecture is polynomial in time with the nearest neighbor coupling and the implementation is less complex. The result shows that improved switching is extremely simple to implement using existing quantum computer candidates.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "100", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "105", "date_publication": "Feb. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "100 - 105"}, "authors": ["Min Jiang", "Xu Huang", "Yiming Zhou"], "keywords": ["Arrays", "Couplings", "Indexing", "Logic gates", "Quality of service", "Sorting", "Switches", "circuit", "quantum information", "quantum sorting", "quantum switching", ""], "arnumber": "6077943"}
