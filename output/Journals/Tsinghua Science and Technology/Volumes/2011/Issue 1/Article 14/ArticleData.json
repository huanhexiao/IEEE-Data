The strict implant size limitation results in a short distance between microphones. The fractional delay problem due to the short distance between microphones is solved by a maximal flat (Maxflat) finite impulse response (FIR) filter, using the Maxflat error criteria at a low frequency containing most of the speech information and energy. The fractional Maxflat FIR filter approximates the ideal digital fractional filter at the magnitude response, phase response, and phase delay characteristics, and is also very low order. The results demonstrate that the Maxflat FIR filter accurately and effectively solves the fractional digital delay and is very suitable for real-time speech processing in practical cochlear implant products.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "90", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "94", "date_publication": "Feb. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "90 - 94"}, "authors": ["Yousheng Chen", "Qin Gong"], "keywords": ["Array signal processing", "Cochlear implants", "Delay", "Finite impulse response filter", "Least squares approximation", "Microphones", "Speech", "Maxflat FIR filter", "directional speech enhancement system", "fractional delay", "microphone array", ""], "arnumber": "6077941"}
