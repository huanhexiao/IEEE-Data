This paper describes a cluster-based FPGA placement algorithm targeted to a new commercial hierarchical FPGA device. The algorithm is based on a Markov clustering algorithm that defines a sequence of stochastic matrices operating on a generating matrix from the input FPGA circuit netlist. The core of the algorithm tightly couples a Markov clustering process with a multilevel placement process. Tests show its excellent adaptability to hierarchical FPGAs. The average wirelength results produced by the algorithm are 22.3% shorter than the results produced by the current hierarchical FPGA placer.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "62", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "68", "date_publication": "Feb. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "62 - 68"}, "authors": ["Hui Dai", "Qiang Zhou", "Jinian Bian"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Clustering algorithms", "Computer architecture", "Field programmable gate arrays", "Markov processes", "Partitioning algorithms", "Routing", "Markov chain clustering", "hierarchical FPGAs", "placement", ""], "arnumber": "6077937"}
