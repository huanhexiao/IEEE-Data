The multilevel partitioning alternately uses two FM variants in the refinement stage to give a more uniform wire distribution. The global placement is based on a top-down recursive bisection framework. The partitioning algorithm is used in the bisectioning to impact the wire density uniformity. Tests show that, with a 10% constraint, the partitioning produces solutions with more balanced edge weights that are 837% better than from hMetis, 1039.1 % better than MLPart, and 762.9% better than FM in terms of imbalance proportion and that this global placement algorithm improves ROOSTER with a more uniform wire distribution by 3.1 % on average with an increased wire length of only 3.0%.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "41", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "50", "date_publication": "Feb. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2011", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "41 - 50"}, "authors": ["Changdao Dong", "Qiang Zhou", "Yici Cal", "Dawei Liu"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Clustering algorithms", "Frequency modulation", "Noise measurement", "Partitioning algorithms", "Routing", "Wires", "chemical-mechanical polishing (CMP)", "design for manufacturing (DFM)", "partitioning", "placement", "wire-density", ""], "arnumber": "6077934"}
