The CBS protocol uses broadcasting rather than pairwise communication to accomplish synchronization. In the CBS scheme, the initial offset of local clocks can be successfully eliminated by the operation of clapping nodes, which leads to significant improvement in synchronization accuracy. The CBS protocol was implemented on the TelosB platform and its performance was evaluated in a variety of experiments. The results demonstrate that the CBS protocol outperforms the current state-of-the-art approach, the Flooding Time Synchronization Protocol (FTSP), in both single-hop and multi-hop scenarios in terms of synchronous precision and energy consumption. In multi-hop scenarios, the CBS algorithm keeps about 50% of its synchronization errors within 1 ms. In comparison, the FTSP keeps less than 7% of its synchronization errors within this range. In both single-hop and multi-hop scenarios, the CBS protocol is over 3.2 times more energy-efficient than the FTSP.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "632", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "639", "date_publication": "Dec. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 19 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "632 - 639"}, "authors": ["Xingfa Shen", "Xin Qian", "Bei Zhao", "Qiming Fang", "Guojun Dai"], "keywords": ["Broadcasting", "Delay", "Protocols", "Synchronization", "Time varying systems", "Wireless sensor networks", "communication overhead", "synchronization accuracy", "time synchronization", "wireless sensor networks", ""], "arnumber": "6133357"}
