Available bandwidth measurement has been discussed previously in the computer networking community. Currently, it is important for cyber-physical applications to behave smartly since these applications prefer small data packets, short round-trip times, and sudden bursts of traffic. A new available bandwidth measurement technique for cyber-physical applications, SOProbe, was introduced and its accuracy was verified through ns-2 simulation. The experimental data indicate that this methodology can enable the gateway node to measure the available bandwidth of a path at low cost.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "601", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "610", "date_publication": "Dec. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 19 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "601 - 610"}, "authors": ["Hui Zhou"], "keywords": ["Bandwidth allocation", "Internet", "Mobile communication", "Mobile computing", "Mobile handsets", "Servers", "Wireless sensor networks", "cyber-physical application", "mobile computing", "sensor network", ""], "arnumber": "6133354"}
