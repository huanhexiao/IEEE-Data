The fast-growing number of wireless sensor networks, the variety of sensors, the different granularity of time control in cyber-physical systems, and the heterogeneous devices and networks in internet of things impose several challenges in both traditional research problems and new research agendas, such as channel estimation, network protocol design, resource management, system design, application development, integration of multiple systems, and smooth transition from legacy systems. The objective of this special issue is to gather recent advances addressing networks, systems, algorithms, and applications that support the symbiosis of wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and internet of things.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "559", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "560", "date_publication": "Dec. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 19 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "559 - 560"}, "authors": ["Xufei Mao", "Chi Zhou", "Yuan He", "Zheng Yang", "Shaojie Tang", "Weichao Wang"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Communication system security", "Navigation", "Sensors", "Wireless communication", "Wireless sensor networks", ""], "arnumber": "6133348"}
