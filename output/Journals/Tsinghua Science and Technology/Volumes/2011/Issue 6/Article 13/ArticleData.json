Recent studies have focused on navigation protocols to safely guide people to exits while helping them avoid hazardous areas. However, those approaches are not applicable in all circumstances. Both the dynamics of the environment and the mobility of users are key challenges for the efficiency and effectiveness of navigation protocols. The concepts of navigability and reachability are used to evaluate three typical navigation approaches. A large number of simulation results show that these two indicators effectively identify the performance levels of navigation protocols in changing environments.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "657", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "668", "date_publication": "Dec. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 19 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "657 - 668"}, "authors": ["Lin Wang", "Wenyuan Liu"], "keywords": ["Emergency services", "Hazardous areas", "Heuristic algorithms", "Navigation", "Protocols", "Sensors", "Wireless sensor networks", "emergency navigation", "navigability", "reachability", "wireless sensor networks", ""], "arnumber": "6133360"}
