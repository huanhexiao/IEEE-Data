This article designs a fuzzy control algorithm for tunnel lighting energy control systems. The system uses LED (Light Emitting Diode) lighting, so the fuzzy control algorithm is designed for LED lights. The traffic and the natural illumination level are used as parameters in the intelligent lighting control algorithm. This system has been deployed in the Lengshui tunnel on the 49th provincial highway of Zhejiang province and operated for more than six months. The performance results show that the energy conservation system provides sufficient lighting levels for traffic safety with significant energy conservation.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "576", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "582", "date_publication": "Dec. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 19 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "576 - 582"}, "authors": ["Hong Zeng", "Jian Qiu", "Xingfa Shen", "Guojun Dai", "Peng Liu", "Shuping Le"], "keywords": ["Energy conservation", "Fuzzy control", "Light emitting diodes", "Lighting control", "Road transportation", "Tunneling", "LED (Light Emitting Diode)", "energy conservation", "fuzzy algorithm", "natural light illumination", "tunnel lighting", "vehicle throughput", ""], "arnumber": "6133351"}
