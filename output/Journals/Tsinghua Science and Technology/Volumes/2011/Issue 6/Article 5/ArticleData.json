Assigning the same or adjacent frequencies to cells close to each other will introduce co-channel and adjacent channel interference which will reduce network performance. Traditionally, man power is used to check and allocate new frequencies which is time consuming and the accuracy is not satisfactory. This paper presents an intelligent analysis method for optimization of co-channel and adjacent channel interference by exploiting cell configuration information. The method defines an interference evaluation model by analyzing various factors such as the base station layer, the azimuth ward relationship, and the cell neighborhood relationships. The interference for each frequency is evaluated and the problem frequencies are optimized. This method is verified by a large number of actual datasets from an in-service GSM network. The results show this method has better intelligence, accuracy, timeliness, and visualization than traditional methods.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "583", "volume": "16", "lastpage": "588", "date_publication": "Dec. 2011", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2011", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 19 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "583 - 588"}, "authors": ["Lina Lan", "Xuerong Gou", "Jingli Mao", "Wenyuan Ke"], "keywords": ["Azimuth", "Base stations", "GSM", "Interchannel interference", "Interference", "Optimization", "GSM frequency optimization", "azimuth ward", "base station site layer", "co-channel and adjacent channel interference", "interference evaluation model", "neighborhood relationship", "triangulation", ""], "arnumber": "6133352"}
