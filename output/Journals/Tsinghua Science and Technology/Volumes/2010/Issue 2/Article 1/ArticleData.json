We present a global illumination model for multiple scattering of incident sun and sky illumination within the field of grass. We model the grass as a continuous distribution of infinitesimal colored scattering flakes and solve a system of differential equations for the radiance transport. We repeat this for a collection of grass bending directions and amounts, and then interpolate the solutions when rendering animations of blowing grass.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "133", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "137", "date_publication": "April 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "133 - 137"}, "authors": ["N.
