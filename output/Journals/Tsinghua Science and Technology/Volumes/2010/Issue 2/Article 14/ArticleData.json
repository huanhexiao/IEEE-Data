Spatial spectrum analyses show that the majority of sea clutter has low-frequency characteristics, compared to the high-frequency characteristics of the targets. This paper proposes a frequency-based spatial tracking filter to suppress sea clutter to facilitate targets identification. Experimental results show that the signal-to-clutter ratio can increase by more than 10 dB after filtering and the algorithm is feasible for practical use. In addition, the filtering equation can be optimized to maximize the signal-to-clutter ratio improvement. The equation parameters can also be adjusted to give a proper cut-off frequency for different targets and clutter.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "228", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "234", "date_publication": "April 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "228 - 234"}, "authors": ["Jingyao Liu", "Huadong Meng", "Hao Zhang", "Xiqin Wang"], "keywords": ["Clutter", "Cutoff frequency", "Equations", "Low pass filters", "Mathematical model", "Radar tracking", "Thyristors", "sea clutter suppression", "spatial spectrum", "spatial tracking filter", "target indication", ""], "arnumber": "6076106"}
