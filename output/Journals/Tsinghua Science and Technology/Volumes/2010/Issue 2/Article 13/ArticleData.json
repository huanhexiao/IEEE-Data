An improved multiplying digital-to-analog converter is used to provide the dual-mode operation. A pre-charged fast power-on switched operational amplifier is used to reduce the power consumption of the pipelined ADC to 28.98 mW/32.74 mW at 40 MHz/80 MHz sampling rates. The ADC was designed in a 1.8-V 1 P6M 0.18-J.lm CMOS process. Simulations indicate that the ADC exhibits a spurious free dynamic range of 90.24 dB/58.33 dB and signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio of 73.81 dB/47.85 dB at 40 MHz/80 MHz sampling frequencies for a 19-MHz input sinusoidal signal.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "221", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "227", "date_publication": "April 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "221 - 227"}, "authors": ["Qi Wei", "Dandan Han", "Huazhong Yang"], "keywords": ["Capacitors", "Clocks", "Noise", "Operational amplifiers", "Pipelines", "Power demand", "Switches", "analog-to-digital converter", "pipeline", "switched operational amplifire", ""], "arnumber": "6076105"}
