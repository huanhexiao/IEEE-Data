This work gives an energy-efficient arbitration mechanism that enhances the performance of compression algorithms by avoiding unnecessary energy losses. The adaptive compression arbitration system uses a new prediction modeling and adaptation. Tests show that the modeling method gives better predictions with the adaptive mechanism needing less data for modeling, which allows on-line prediction modeling instead of an off-line training process. Moreover, adaptive adjustments of the model parameters enable the system to keep good arbitration precision even as the data characteristics or applications change.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "202", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "208", "date_publication": "April 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "202 - 208"}, "authors": ["Beihua Ying", "Yongpan Liu", "Hui Wang"], "keywords": ["Adaptation models", "Adaptive systems", "Data compression", "Data models", "Predictive models", "Sensors", "Wireless sensor networks", "adaptive mechanism", "arbitration system", "data compression", "energy efficiency", "wireless sensor network", ""], "arnumber": "6076102"}
