To facilitate simultaneous packet transmissions, both transceivers have to exchange preambles to calculate the channel state information. This exchange is combined with the RTS (request to send)/CTS (clear to send) handshake which is used to contend for the channel in WLANs. This study presents an expression for the optimal number of simultaneous data transmissions under the distributed coordinate function mechanism derived using the Markov chain model, as well as an analytical formula for the optimal system throughput given the length of the contention window and the number of nodes in the network. The analytical results show that the system throughput cannot be enhanced by simply increasing the number of simultaneous data transmissions.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "246", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "250", "date_publication": "April 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "246 - 250"}, "authors": ["Yu Rao", "Shengbo Chen", "Wei Chen", "Xuming Liu"], "keywords": ["Data communication", "Equations", "MIMO", "Markov processes", "Mathematical model", "Throughput", "Wireless LAN", "cross layer design", "distributed coordination function (DCF)", "media access control (MAC)", "multiple input multiple output (MIMO)", "protocol optimization", ""], "arnumber": "6076108"}
