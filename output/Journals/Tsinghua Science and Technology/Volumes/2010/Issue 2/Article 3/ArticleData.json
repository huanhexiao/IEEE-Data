Theoretical analysis based on the coupled mode theory and numerical example show that complete cross power transfers can be obtained near the microring resonances. Applications of the device include power dividers, low-power thermo-optic or electro-optic switches, and modulators.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "145", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "150", "date_publication": "April 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "145 - 150"}, "authors": ["V.
