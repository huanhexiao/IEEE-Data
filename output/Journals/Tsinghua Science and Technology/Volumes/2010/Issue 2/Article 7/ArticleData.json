Since high-dimensional unitary operations are very difficult to directly implement in physics experiments, methods are used to avoid high-dimensional unitary operations during the teleportation process. This paper describes how to construct a deterministic teleportation channel and a control channel using Bell state measurements only instead of high-dimensional unitary operations. Here, the general four-particle and five-particle class states are used as the potential quantum channel and the control channel for deterministic teleportation even without access to the relevant parameters. The results show that this scheme makes physical realization of teleportation more reasonable.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "184", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "189", "date_publication": "April 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "184 - 189"}, "authors": ["Min Jiang", "Xu Huang", "Yiming Zhou"], "keywords": ["Atmospheric measurements", "Joints", "Measurement units", "Particle measurements", "Probabilistic logic", "Teleportation", "Bell state measurements", "deterministic teleportation", "multi-particle state", "quantum information", ""], "arnumber": "6076099"}
