Both electrical and photonic UWB pulse generation methods are employed and its performance is compared. By utilizing optimum UWB pulse design and employing a digital signal processing (DSP) receiver, a bit-error-rate above the forward error correction (FEe) limit for 8 meters of wireless emission is obtained in our photonic generation UWB system. A noticeable increase in the channel capacity is achieved compared to previously reported results.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "169", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "173", "date_publication": "April 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "169 - 173"}, "authors": ["Roberto Rodes", "Xianbin Yu", "Antonio Caballero", "Jesper Bevensee Jensen", "Timothy Braidwood Gibbon", "Neil Guerrero Gonzalez", "Idelfonso Tafur Monroy"], "keywords": ["Channel capacity", "Digital signal processing", "FCC", "Optical fibers", "Photonics", "Ultra wideband technology", "Wireless communication", "UWB-over-fiber", "channel capacity", "impulse radio ultra-wideband", "personal area networks", ""], "arnumber": "6076097"}
