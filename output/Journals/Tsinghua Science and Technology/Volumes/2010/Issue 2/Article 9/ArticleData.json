Two different types of incident light on the same coupled resonator geometry are shown to lead to different system transmission features. The EIT-like phenomenon occurs in the type I case with the transmission being symmetric around the zero-single-pass-phase-shift frequency. In the type II case the resonant frequency has a blue shift corresponding to the increasing coupling strength between the two ring resonators. Also, the critical-coupling-like condition exists in the type II configuration to maintain the zero-single pass-phase-shift frequency. The incident light, as well as the geometry, partially determine the mode interference in the coupled ring resonator system.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "198", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "201", "date_publication": "April 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "198 - 201"}, "authors": ["Yue Sun", "Lianyu Xu", "Chao Peng", "Zhengbin Li"], "keywords": ["Couplings", "Geometry", "Optical ring resonators", "Optical waveguides", "Resonant frequency", "coupled ring resonator", "mode excitation", "resonance frequency shift", ""], "arnumber": "6076101"}
