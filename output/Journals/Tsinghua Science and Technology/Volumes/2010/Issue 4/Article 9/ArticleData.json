This paper introduces a microchannel condenser for domestic refrigerators with a theoretical model to evaluate its performance. The model was used to obtain the optimal design parameters for different numbers of tubes and tube lengths. The results show that the needed tube height of the downward section decreases with the number of tubes and the tube diameter. Compared with the original condenser, the present optimal design parameters can reduce the total metal mass by 48.60/0 for the two wall two side design and by 26% for the two wall one side design. Thus, the present condenser is much better than the condensers usually used in actual domestic refrigerators.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "426", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "433", "date_publication": "Aug. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "426 - 433"}, "authors": ["Zhang Huiyong", "Li Junming", "Li Hongqi"], "keywords": ["Atmospheric modeling", "Electron tubes", "Heat transfer", "Heating", "Refrigerants", "Refrigerators", "Resistance", "condenser", "micro-tube", "numerical simulation", "refrigerator", ""], "arnumber": "6076140"}
