The differences can be explained using second stir theory. The weak vortices and small stir energy in natural circulation systems result in nucleate boiling occurring earlier than in forced convection systems. In natural circulation systems high mass flow rates are accompanied by large kinetic energies and large stir energies, which enables changes in the directions of flow eddies and energy transport. The equilibrium vapor qualities at ONB are then higher at higher mass flow rates. The influence of other flow parameters on ONB can be evaluated by the relationships between these flow parameters and the mass flow rate. The same values can lead to different results due to different eddy directions. This indicates that the quantitative comparability in mathematics cannot be considered as only scientific standard. The second stir theory offers a new visual angle for researches on natural circulation.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "441", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "446", "date_publication": "Aug. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "441 - 446"}, "authors": ["Tao Zhou", "Ruichang Yang", "Zhenyang Li", "Ming Zhang", "Mengying Liu"], "keywords": ["Electron tubes", "Fluids", "Force", "Heat transfer", "Kinetic energy", "Water heating", "boiling", "direction", "natural circulation", "onset of nucleate boiling (ONB)", "second stir theory", ""], "arnumber": "6076142"}
