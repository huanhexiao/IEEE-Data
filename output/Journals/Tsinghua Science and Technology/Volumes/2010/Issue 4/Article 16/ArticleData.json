This model extends the original cell transmission model (CTM) mechanism by defining various shapes of fundamental diagrams to reproduce more complex traffic phenomena, including capacity drops, lane-by-lane variations, nonhomogeneous wave propagation velocities, and temporal lags. A field test on a Canadian freeway was used to demonstrate the validity of the location specific CTM. The simulated spatio-temporal evolutions of traffic flow show that the model can be used to describe the traffic dynamics near bottlenecks more precisely than the original model.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "475", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "480", "date_publication": "Aug. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "475 - 480"}, "authors": ["Xiqun Chen", "Qixin Shi", "Li Li"], "keywords": ["Data models", "Equations", "Mathematical model", "Shape", "Traffic control", "Vehicle dynamics", "Vehicles", "cell transmission model (CTM)", "freeway traffic", "fundamental diagram", ""], "arnumber": "6076147"}
