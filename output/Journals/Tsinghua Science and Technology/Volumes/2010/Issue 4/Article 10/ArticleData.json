The system capacity can then be regulated to match the compressor loads to the heating or cooling needs to improve the energy efficiency and lower energy costs. The motor and compression characteristics of WSHP were modeled to include the coupling between the motor speed and the torque characteristics and compression characteristics. An analytical model is given for a variable speed hermetic scroll compressor that describes various factors, such as the drive frequency, suction pressure, and discharge pressure as a function of the compressor speed. The model was validated experimentally using R22 and R134a in an experimental WSHP with variable speed control using frequency conversion. The results show that the analytical model properly describes the variable speed characteristics and provides a control strategy for adjusting the capacity of scroll compressors to match the heat pump or air conditioner operating conditions.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "434", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "440", "date_publication": "Aug. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "434 - 440"}, "authors": ["Zhifang Xue", "Lin Shi"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Analytical models", "Frequency conversion", "Heat pumps", "Refrigerants", "Velocity control", "Water heating", "frequency conversion", "modeling", "scroll compressor", "variable speed control", "water source heat pump", ""], "arnumber": "6076141"}
