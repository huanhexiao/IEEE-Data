This paper proposes a new problem for the integrated quay crane and yard truck scheduling for inbound containers. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer programming (MIP) model. Due to the intractability, a genetic algorithm (GA) and a modified Johnson's Rule-based heuristic algorithm (MJRHA) are used for the problem solution. In addition, two closed form lower bounds are given to evaluate the solution accuracy. Computational experiments show that the solution algorithm can efficiently handle the scheduling problem and that the integrated methods are very useful.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "467", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "474", "date_publication": "Aug. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "467 - 474"}, "authors": ["Jinxin Cao", "Qixin Shi", "Der-Horng Lee"], "keywords": ["Containers", "Cranes", "Dispatching", "Genetic algorithms", "Processor scheduling", "Transportation", "Yttrium", "container terminal", "heuristic algorithm", "mixed integer programming", "scheduling", ""], "arnumber": "6076146"}
