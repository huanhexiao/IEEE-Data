To determine the magnitude of compressive mechanical stress imposed by water swelling in a proton exchange fuel-cell membrane, the osmotic pressure of water in a perfluorosulfonic acid ionomer (Nafion\u00ae N 117) membrane was measured using a hydrostatic piston-cylinder device with an in-situ hydrophilic frit. Experiments indicate that hydrostatic stresses greater than 103.5 MPa are created in a membrane when swollen with water at 23\u00b0C suggesting that pressure from water swelling can distort Nafion N 117-based structures as the osmotic pressure is of the same order of magnitude as the flow stress of Nafion N 117.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "385", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "390", "date_publication": "Aug. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "385 - 390"}, "authors": ["Michael K Budinski", "Adam Cook"], "keywords": ["Degradation", "Fixtures", "Fuel cells", "Pistons", "Pressure measurement", "Stress", "Testing", "fuel-cell", "osmotic pressure", "perfluorosulfonic acid ionomer", "pinholes", "proton exchange membrane", ""], "arnumber": "6076134"}
