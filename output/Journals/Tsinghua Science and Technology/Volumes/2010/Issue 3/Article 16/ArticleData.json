The system design used top-level design, information-sharing, management modeling, and user experience. The system emphasized openness, compatibility, security, extensibility, and practicability. Multi-department management is realized by dividing function domains. Intercommunications and interconnections use a level-division modular design, so the system can be easily extended. The teaching support platform is people oriented with people foremost environment for the users, the associated application environment, the integrated data environment, and the operating environment for high availability.
