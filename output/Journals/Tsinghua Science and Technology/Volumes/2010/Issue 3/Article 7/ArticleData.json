At present, most designs have adopted antenna arrays with reconfigurable elements. However, antenna selection is also an effective method, which has not been fully investigated. In this paper, the potential benefits of a four-element antenna array with selection circuits in the UMTS band (1920\u20132170 MHz) are explored. The array has eight pin-diodes embedded in the feeding network to select any sub-set of elements. For evaluation, an adaptive MIMO system was set up and a measurement campaign was taken in an indoor multi-path environment. The measurements were performed over a 300 MHz bandwidth centered at 2.05 GHz, covering the UMTS band. The results show that different channel conditions prefer different antenna array configurations. Therefore, in varying channel conditions the antenna array can support antenna selection algorithms to select the best sub-set of elements to increase channel capacity.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "294", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "298", "date_publication": "June 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "294 - 298"}, "authors": ["Zhengyi Li", "Xuan Wang", "Zhengwei Du", "Ke Gong"], "keywords": ["Adaptive arrays", "Adaptive systems", "Antenna measurements", "Arrays", "Channel capacity", "MIMO", "adaptive MIMO systems", "antenna selection", "pin-diode", "reconfigurable antenna array", ""], "arnumber": "6076118"}
