The technique produces high performance code by simultaneously balancing instructions among clusters and minimizing the amount of inter-cluster data communications. The scheme is evaluated based on benchmarks extracted from UTDSP. Results show a significant speedup compared with previously used techniques with speed-ups of up to 44%, with average speed-ups ranging from 140/0 (2-cluster) to 18% (4-cluster).", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "299", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "306", "date_publication": "June 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "299 - 306"}, "authors": ["Xu Yang", "Hu He", "Yihe Sun"], "keywords": ["Arrays", "Clustering algorithms", "Delay", "Partitioning algorithms", "Schedules", "Scheduling", "VLIW", "cluster assignments", "clustered VLIW processor", "instruction scheduling", ""], "arnumber": "6076119"}
