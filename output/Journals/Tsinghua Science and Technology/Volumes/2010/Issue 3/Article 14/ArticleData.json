Due to the high volumes of data and relatively limited storage capability, resource allocation and data streaming have to be storage aware. Also to improve system performance, the data streaming and processing have to be concurrent. This study used a genetic algorithm (GA) for workflow scheduling, using on-line measurements and predictions with gray model (GM). On-demand data streaming is used to avoid data overflow through repertory strategies. Tests show that tasks with on-demand data streaming must be balanced to improve overall performance, to avoid system bottlenecks and backlogs of intermediate data, and to increase data throughput for the data processing workflows as a whole.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "335", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "346", "date_publication": "June 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "335 - 346"}, "authors": ["Wen Zhang", "Junwei Cao", "Yisheng Zhong", "Lianchen Liu", "Cheng Wu"], "keywords": ["Bandwidth", "Biological cells", "Data processing", "Processor scheduling", "Resource management", "Throughput", "concurrent", "data streaming", "grid", "storage-aware", "workflow", ""], "arnumber": "6076125"}
