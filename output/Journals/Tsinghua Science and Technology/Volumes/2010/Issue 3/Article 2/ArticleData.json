This paper discusses a comprehensive noise analysis procedure for ESD protection structures and their negative influences on RF ICs. Noise figures (NFs) of commonly used ESD protection structures and their impacts on a single-chip 5.5 GHz low-noise amplifier (LNA) circuit were depicted. A design example in 0.18 \u03bcm SiGe BiCMOS was presented. Measurement results confirm that significant noise degradation occurs in the LNA circuit due to ESD-induced noise effects. A practical design procedure for ESD-protected RF ICs is provided for real-world RF IC optimization.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "259", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "264", "date_publication": "June 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "259 - 264"}, "authors": ["Guang Chen", "Xin Wang", "Siqiang Fan", "He Tang", "Lin Lin", "Albert Wang"], "keywords": ["BiCMOS integrated circuits", "Electrostatic discharge", "Gain", "Noise", "Noise measurement", "Radio frequency", "electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection", "integrated circuits (IC)", "low-noise amplifier (LNA)", "noise figures (NFs)", "radio frequency (RF)", ""], "arnumber": "6076113"}
