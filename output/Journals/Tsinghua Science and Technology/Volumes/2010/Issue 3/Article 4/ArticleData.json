Although the ALH algorithm is well formulated and despite the fact that it performs well in practice, its scalability over a very large data set is limited due to the online distance computations associated with all training instances. In this paper, a novel algorithm, called ALH-Fast and obtained by combining the classification tree algorithm and the ALH, is proposed to reduce the computational load of the ALH algorithm. The experiment results on two large data sets show that the ALH-Fast algorithm is both much faster and more accurate than the ALH algorithm.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "275", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "280", "date_publication": "June 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "275 - 280"}, "authors": ["Tao Yanq", "Vojislav Kecrnan", "Longbing Cao"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Classification algorithms", "Classification tree analysis", "Prediction algorithms", "Support vector machines", "Testing", "Training", "adaptive local hyperplane (ALH)", "classification", "decision tree", ""], "arnumber": "6076115"}
