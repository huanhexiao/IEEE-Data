In the design of packet-based NoC, the packet-length plays an important role in the NoC throughput, latency, and energy consumption. The appropriate NoC packet-length was selected based on simulation and analysis of the packet-length effect on NoC for variable average data block length (ADBL) configuration parameters. A trade-off curve among throughput, latency, and energy consumption was developed and shows that the optimum packet length increases as the ADBL increases.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "288", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "293", "date_publication": "June 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "288 - 293"}, "authors": ["Depeng Jin", "Shijun Lin", "Li Su", "Guofei Zhou", "Lieguang Zeng"], "keywords": ["Energy consumption", "IP networks", "Routing", "Switches", "System-on-a-chip", "Throughput", "Wires", "MP-SoC", "network-on-chip", "packet length effect", "system-on-chip", ""], "arnumber": "6076117"}
