However, most PLC standards such as HomePlug AV use the cyclic-prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM) technology. This paper presents a broadband PLC system using low density parity check (LDPC) coded time domain synchronous OFDM (TDS-OFDM), whose spectrum efficiency is about 10% higher than that of CP-OFDM. With the same bandwidth and the ability to combat the time delay spread as HomePlug AV, this system can provide a maximum throughput of 199.7 Mbps physical layer data rate. Simulations over the measured practical powerline channel in Beijing, China, show that LDPC in the TDS-OFDM system dramatically improves the bit error rate performance, and verify the feasibility and performance of the TDS-OFDM technology for PLC systems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "312", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "318", "date_publication": "June 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "312 - 318"}, "authors": ["Linglong Dai", "Jian Fu", "Jun Wang"], "keywords": ["Bandwidth", "Bit error rate", "Channel models", "Frequency measurement", "OFDM", "Parity check codes", "Signal to noise ratio", "HomePlug AV", "channel measurement", "low density parity check (LDPC)", "powerline communications (PLC)", "time domain synchronous OFDM (TDS OFDM)", ""], "arnumber": "6076121"}
