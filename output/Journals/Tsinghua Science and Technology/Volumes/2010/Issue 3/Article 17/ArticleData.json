However, in noisy and non-rigid object recognition applications, especially for infrared human face recognition, SIFT-based algorithms may mismatch many feature points. This paper presents a star-styled window filter-SIFT (SWF-SIFT) scheme to improve the infrared human face recognition performance by filtering out incorrect matches. Performance comparisons between the SIFT and SWF-SIFT algorithms show the advantages of the SWF-SI FT algorithm through tests using a typical infrared human face database.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "357", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "362", "date_publication": "June 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "357 - 362"}, "authors": ["Chunlin Tan", "Hongqiao Wang", "Pel Deli"], "keywords": ["Face", "Face recognition", "Feature extraction", "Filtering algorithms", "Fingerprint recognition", "Humans", "Matched filters", "human face recognition", "infrared image", "scale invariant feature transform (SIFT)", "star-styled window filter (SWF)", ""], "arnumber": "6076128"}
