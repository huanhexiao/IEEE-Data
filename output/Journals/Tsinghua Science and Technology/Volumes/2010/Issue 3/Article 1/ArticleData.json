This paper describes a method based on automatic expansion of the event triggers for event type recognition. The event triggers are first extended through a thesaurus to enable the extraction of the candidate events and their candidate types. Then, a binary classification method is used to recognize the candidate event types. This method effectively improves the unbalanced data problem in training models and the data sparseness problem with a small corpus. Evaluations on the ACE2005 dataset give a final F-score of 61.24%, which outperforms traditional methods based on pure machine learning.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "251", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "258", "date_publication": "June 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "251 - 258"}, "authors": ["Bing Qin", "Yanyan Zhao", "Xiao Ding", "Ting Liu", "Guofu Zhai"], "keywords": ["Business", "Context", "Data mining", "Entropy", "Feature extraction", "Thesauri", "Training", "event extraction", "event trigger", "event type recognition", ""], "arnumber": "6076112"}
