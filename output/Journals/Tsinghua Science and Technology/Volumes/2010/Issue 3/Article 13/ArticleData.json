This paper presents an acquisition algorithm to timing recovery using the decision-aided extended Kalman filtering (EKF) technique for nonlinear disturbance channels in a wavelet packet transform-based multicarrier modulation communication system. This timing recovery algorithm gives faster convergence, smaller root mean square (RMS) errors, and better bit error rate (BER) performance than traditional timing recovery methods, such as the phase-locked loop (PLL), maximum likelihood (ML), and Kalman filter (KF) methods. Thus, the algorithm is able to handle larger timing errors more reliably and to provide better timing recovery, since the scheme takes into account the nonlinear relationship between the signal samples and timing errors. Simulations for various time-varying channels show that the timing recovery algorithm works well for wavelet packet transform-based multicarrier modulation communication systems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "329", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "334", "date_publication": "June 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "329 - 334"}, "authors": ["Yi Sun", "Jiuyu Hao"], "keywords": ["Adaptation models", "Fading", "Kalman filters", "Modulation", "Phase locked loops", "Timing", "Wavelet packets", "Navelet packet transform", "adaptive timing recovery", "extended Kalmanfilter", "multi carrier modulation", ""], "arnumber": "6076124"}
