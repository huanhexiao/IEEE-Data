This structure is much more sensitive to poly stringer defects and is closer to the real product layout than the currently widely used structure using an active dummy underneath a poly comb. Many testing structure pieces manufactured in a 0.11 \u03bcn foundries process detect were stringers to characterize the processing design with the process testing structure. The data shows that the new structure more efficiently detects poly stringers. The results also show that the poly stringers are related to the shallow trench isolation (STI) width. This structure can be used to identify new designs for manufacturing rules for the active space. Thus, this method is very useful for IC foundries to detect poly stringers and to characterize the processing line isolation and tune the process recipe to improve product yields.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "347", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "351", "date_publication": "June 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "347 - 351"}, "authors": ["Xiong Hu", "Weiwei Pan", "Zheng Shi", "Xiaolang Yan", "Tiezhong Ma"], "keywords": ["CMOS integrated circuits", "Copper", "Etching", "Layout", "Random access memory", "Shape", "Testing", "CMOS testing", "poly stringer", "shallow trench isolation (STI)", ""], "arnumber": "6076126"}
