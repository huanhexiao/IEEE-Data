The core idea is to group relationships by their types, then rank the types, and finally rank the instances attached to each type. The ranking criteria for each step considers the mapping rules and heterogeneous graph structure of the data web. Tests based on a social network dataset show that the linked data ranking is effective and easier for people to understand. This approach benefits from utilizing relationships deduced from mapping rules based on table schemas and distinguishing the relationship types, which results in better ranking andvisualization of the linked data.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "642", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "649", "date_publication": "Dec. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "642 - 649"}, "authors": ["Jing Zhang", "Chune Ma", "Chenting Zhao", "Jun Zhang", "Li Yi", "Xinsheng Mao"], "keywords": ["Browsers", "Equations", "Marine vehicles", "Mathematical model", "Relational databases", "Social network services", "linked data", "mapping rules", "ranking", "relational databases (ROB)", ""], "arnumber": "6077914"}
