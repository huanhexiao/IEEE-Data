The focus is on exploring the ways to improve the performance of the unsupervised sentiment classification based on limited existing sentiment resources in Chinese. On the one hand, all available Chinese sentiment lexicons \u2014 individual and combined \u2014 are evaluated under our proposed framework. On the other hand, the domain dependent sentiment noise words are identified and removed using unlabeled data, to improve the classification performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such attempt. Experiments have been conducted on three open datasets in two domains, and the results show that the proposed algorithm for sentiment noise words removal can improve the classification performance significantly.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "702", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "708", "date_publication": "Dec. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "702 - 708"}, "authors": ["Zhongwu Zhai", "Hua Xu", "Peifa Jia"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Classification algorithms", "Laboratories", "Marine vehicles", "Natural languages", "Noise", "Vectors", "domain dependent", "sentiment noise words", "unsupervised sentiment classification", ""], "arnumber": "6077921"}
