This paper analyzes the important under-researched problem of learning DLP from uncertain data. Current studies have rarely explored the plentiful uncertain data populating the semantic web. This algorithm handles uncertain data in an inductive logic programming framework by modifying the performance evaluation criteria. A pseudo-log-likelihood based measure is used to evaluate the performance of different literals under uncertainties. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that the approach is able to automatically learn a rule-set from uncertain data with acceptable accuracy.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "650", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "656", "date_publication": "Dec. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "650 - 656"}, "authors": ["Man Zhu", "Zhiqiang Gao", "Guilin Qi", "Qiu Ji"], "keywords": ["Grounding", "Joints", "Markov random fields", "Ontologies", "Probabilistic logic", "Semantic Web", "Markov logic networks", "description logic programs", "inductive logic programming", ""], "arnumber": "6077915"}
