This paper shows how to address the problem of evolving ontologies with less manual case-based reasoning using an automatic selection mechanism. An automatic ontology evolution strategy selection framework is presented that automates the evolution. A minimal change impact algorithm is also developed for the framework. The method is shown to be effective in a case study.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "716", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "723", "date_publication": "Dec. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "716 - 723"}, "authors": ["Gan Dong", "Zhipeng Gao", "Xuesong Qiu"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Cognition", "Decision making", "Gallium nitride", "Humans", "Mesons", "Ontologies", "automatic ontology evolution strategy selection (AOESS)", "minimal change impact", "ontology", "ontology evolution", ""], "arnumber": "6077923"}
