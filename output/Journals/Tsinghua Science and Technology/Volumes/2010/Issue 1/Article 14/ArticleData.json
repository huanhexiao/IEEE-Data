The method takes into account a motion vector field determined from a four-dimensional (4\u20130) uncompensated image data set. Surface models of the lung and the ribs are tracked through the 4\u20130 data set to create motion information within the entire thorax. Finally, an image is reconstructed using motion compensated back-projection. The results show that due to the use of shape models for the motion estimation, the method is fast and robust. Furthermore, since the surfaces are tracked individually, reconciling the opposite motion direction of the lung and rib cage is avoided in one motion vector field.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "87", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "95", "date_publication": "Feb. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "87 - 95"}, "authors": ["Thomas Kohler", "Tobias Klinder", "Udo van Stevendaal", "Cristian Lorenz", "Peter Forthmann"], "keywords": ["Adaptation models", "Computed tomography", "Image reconstruction", "Lungs", "Shape", "Thorax", "Tracking", "computed tomography (CT)", "motion compensation", "reconstruction", "respiratory motion", ""], "arnumber": "6076083"}
