Such algorithms may lead to reduced imaging dose and time, and to the design of innovative configurations tailored to specific imaging tasks. In recent years, a carbon-nanotube (CNT)-based field-emission x-ray source has been developed, which offers easy electronic control of radiation and thus can be an ideal candidate for gated imaging. We have recently proposed algorithms for image reconstruction from fan- and cone-beam data collected at highly sparse angular views through minimization of the total-variation (TV) of the image subject to the condition that the estimated data are consistent with the measured data. In this work, we investigate and demonstrate the application of the TV-minimization algorithm to reconstructing images from mouse data acquired with a CNT-based CT scanner at a number of views much lower than what is used in conventional CT imaging. The results demonstrate that the TV-minimization algorithm can yield images with quality comparable to those obtained from a large number of views by use of the conventional algorithms. The significance of the work may lie in that the substantial reduction of projection views promised by the TV-minimization algorithm can be exploited for reducing imaging dose and time or for improving temporal resolution in tasks such as dynamic imaging.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "74", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "78", "date_publication": "Feb. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "74 - 78"}, "authors": ["Junquo Bian", "Xiao Han", "Emil Y Sidky", "Guohua Cao", "Jianpinq Lu", "Otto Zhou", "Xiaochuan Pan"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Computed tomography", "Image reconstruction", "Mice", "Signal processing algorithms", "X-ray imaging", "TV minimization", "compressed sensing", "computed tomography", "image reconstruction", ""], "arnumber": "6076081"}
