Software pipelining and proper configuration of the data transfer enables a 2563 volume to be reconstructed in about 42 seconds from 360 projections with very good accuracy. This implementation reveals the potential of modern high-performance DSPs in accelerating image reconstruction, especially when cost and power consumption are emphasized.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "108", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "113", "date_publication": "Feb. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "108 - 113"}, "authors": ["Wenxuan Liang", "Hui Zhang", "Guangshu Hu"], "keywords": ["Arrays", "Computed tomography", "Digital signal processing", "Image reconstruction", "Pipeline processing", "Software", "computed tomography", "digital signal processor (DSP)", "high performance computing", "software pipelining", ""], "arnumber": "6076086"}
