At the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), the X-ray Imaging and Biomedical Applications Beamline was built and started regular user operation in May 2009. Both qualitative (without phase retrieval) and quantitative (with phase retrieval) three-dimensional IL-XPCT experimental techniques have been established at the beamline. IL-XPCT experiments of a test sample (plastic pipes) used to evaluate the technique, and of a biological sample (locust) at the beamline are reported. Two series of images, qualitative and quantitative, including tomographic slices and three-dimensional rendering images were obtained. In qualitative images, there is a strong edge-enhancement which leads to very clear sample contours, while in quantitative images, the edge-enhancement fades but quantitative measurement of sample's phase information could be achieved. The experiments demonstrate that the combination of qualitative and quantitative images is useful for biological sample studies.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "102", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "107", "date_publication": "Feb. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "102 - 107"}, "authors": ["Rongchang Chen", "Honglan Xie", "Luigi Rigon", "Guohao Du", "Edoardo Castelli", "Tiqiao Xiao"], "keywords": ["Biology", "Biomedical imaging", "Computed tomography", "Image edge detection", "Image reconstruction", "X-ray imaging", "X-ray", "phase contrast tomography", "phase retrieval", "synchrotron radiation", ""], "arnumber": "6076085"}
