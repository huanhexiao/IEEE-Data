The backscatter signal is treated as an emitter in a non-uniformly attenuating medium. This type of tomography has applications in radiology and dentistry for which metals effectively block the transmission of X-rays. Scanning for metals also has applications in security/baggage screening. The results show that when the forward scattering angle is zero, the algorithm, with a redefinition of the density function f, reduces to the PET attenuation correction.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "62", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "67", "date_publication": "Feb. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "62 - 67"}, "authors": ["William G Hawkins"], "keywords": ["Attenuation", "Backscatter", "Positron emission tomography", "Scattering", "Transforms", "backscatter tomography", "baggage screening", "dental tomography", "implant imaging", "non-uniform attenuation", ""], "arnumber": "6076079"}
