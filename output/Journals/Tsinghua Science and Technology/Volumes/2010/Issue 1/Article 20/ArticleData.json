The imaging processes of the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) Imager are computer-simulated, in which the Earth shelter is treated as a main problem. A modified ART method is devised to resolve the incomplete data reconstruction problem to validate and evaluate the proposed methods. The cone-beam EUV data are simulated based on the 3-D phantom from both a circular and semi-circular trajectories. Quantitative reconstruction results demonstrate the correctness of the proposed modified ART algorithm. The CT technique can be used to calculate the global density of the plasmasphere from the EUV data.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "127", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "132", "date_publication": "Feb. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "127 - 132"}, "authors": ["Zhiqiang Chen", "Jie Zheng", "Liang Li", "Ronglan Xu", "Xin Jin", "Ya Huang"], "keywords": ["Computed tomography", "Earth", "Image reconstruction", "Phantoms", "Subspace constraints", "Ultraviolet sources", "ART algorithm", "computed tomography (CT)", "extreme ultraviolet (EUV)", "plasmasphere", ""], "arnumber": "6076089"}
