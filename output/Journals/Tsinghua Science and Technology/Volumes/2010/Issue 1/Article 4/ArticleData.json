In limited angle tomography exact three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction is not achievable. With this method a metric for the reachable reconstruction quality by defined X-ray source trajectories is calculated. The result of our method is independent of reconstruction algorithms. Our approach is based on the gradients of the scanned volume and their grade of determinability. Compared to simulated reconstruction accuracy with simultaneous algebraic reconstruction techniques, the method of evaluation shows the same dependencies on X-ray source trajectories. By using the proposed method different source trajectories for a limited angle range are comparable with respect to the reachable reconstruction quality.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "25", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "Feb. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "25 - 29"}, "authors": ["Fabian Stopp", "Christian Winne", "Emanuel Jank", "Erwin Keeve"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Image reconstruction", "Three dimensional displays", "Tomography", "Trajectory", "X-ray imaging", "3-D reconstruction quality", "X-ray source trajectories", "intraoperative imaging", "limited angle tomography", ""], "arnumber": "6076073"}
