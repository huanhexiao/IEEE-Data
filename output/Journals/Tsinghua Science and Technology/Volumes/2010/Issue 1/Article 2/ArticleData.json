Recently Nvidia releases common unified device architecture (CUDA), allowing developers to access to the processing power of Nvidia graphical processing units (GPUs), in order to perform general purpose computations. The use of the GPU, as an alternative computation platform, allows decreasing processing times, for parallel algorithms. This paper aims to demonstrate the feasibility of such an implementation for the iterative image reconstruction. The ordered subsets convex (OSC) algorithm, an iterative reconstruction algorithm for transmission tomography, has been developed with CUDA. The performances have been evaluated and compared with another implementation using a single CPU node. The result shows that speed-ups of two orders of magnitude, with a negligible impact on image accuracy, have been observed.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "11", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Feb. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "11 - 16"}, "authors": ["Damien Vintache", "Bernard Humbert", "David Brasse"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Detectors", "Graphics processing unit", "Hardware", "Image reconstruction", "Phantoms", "Tomography", "image reconstruction", "parallel processing", "tomography", ""], "arnumber": "6076071"}
