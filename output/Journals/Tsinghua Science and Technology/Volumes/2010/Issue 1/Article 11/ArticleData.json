The BPF algorithm can reconstruct 3-D regionof-interest (ROI) images from data containing truncations. However, like many other existing algorithms for cone-beam configurations, the BPF algorithm involves a back-projection with a spatially varying weighting factor, which can result in the non-uniform noise levels in reconstructed images and increased computation time. In this work, we propose a BPF algorithm to eliminate the spatially varying weighting factor by using a rebinned geometry for a general scanning trajectory. This proposed BPF algorithm has an improved noise property, while retaining the advantages of the original BPF algorithm such as minimum data requirement.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "68", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "73", "date_publication": "Feb. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "68 - 73"}, "authors": ["Junquo Bian", "Dan Xia", "Emil Y Sidky", "Xiaochuan Pan"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Band pass filters", "Computed tomography", "Detectors", "Image reconstruction", "Trajectory", "computed tomography", "general trajectory", "rebinned backprojection-filtration", "region of interest", ""], "arnumber": "6076080"}
