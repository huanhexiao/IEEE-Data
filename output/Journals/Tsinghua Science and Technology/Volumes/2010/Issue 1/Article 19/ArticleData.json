Each object has independently rigid motion which includes translation and rotation. The traditional FBP algorithm can resolve the one-object motion problem rather well. However, it suffers from perceptible motion artifacts in multi-object cases. This paper proposes a new motion-compensated reconstruction approach with a priori knowledge of the rigid motion model. Both an FBP-type and an ART-type algorithm were derived. In an effort to evaluate the proposed algorithms, we have performed numerical studies by using different rigid motion models. Quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed FBP-type and ART-type algorithms can reconstruct multi-object free of motion artifacts.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "120", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "126", "date_publication": "Feb. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "120 - 126"}, "authors": ["Xin Jin", "Liang Li", "Zhiqian Chen", "Li Zhang", "Yuxiang Xing"], "keywords": ["Computed tomography", "Earth", "Image reconstruction", "Phantoms", "Reconstruction algorithms", "Subspace constraints", "Ultraviolet sources", "ART", "FBP", "computed tomography (CT)", "motion artifacts", "motion-compensated method", ""], "arnumber": "6076088"}
