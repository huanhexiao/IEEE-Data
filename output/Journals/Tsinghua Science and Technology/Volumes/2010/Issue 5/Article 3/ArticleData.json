Shortages of some classes were treated according to lostsales, while those of the others were backlogged. In each period, both replenishment decisions of inventory and allocation for all classes were made by a setup cost for each replenishment. By using the approach of stochastic dynamic programming formulation, the optimal replenishment policy is a state-dependent (8, S) policy, and the optimal allocation decision follows a state-dependent prioritization policy.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "498", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "508", "date_publication": "Oct. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "498 - 508"}, "authors": ["Yun Zhou", "Xiaobo Zhao"], "keywords": ["Equations", "Marketing and sales", "Procurement", "Resource management", "Stochastic processes", "Vectors", "backorder", "demand classes", "inventory", "lost-sale", "setup cost", ""], "arnumber": "6076153"}
