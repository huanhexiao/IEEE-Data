The velocity fields were measured using the particle tracking velocimetry technique. The tangential velocity formula of the surface flow field was derived based on the Navier-Stokes equations, and this formula greatly improved the consistency between the numerical and experimental data. Also, the formula has the advantage of describing the tangential velocity more accurately than previous formulas. The current research is based on established engineering practices, and the results provide a valuable reference for actual projects designed to prevent and eliminate surface vortexes.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "561", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "565", "date_publication": "Oct. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "561 - 565"}, "authors": ["Yingkui Wang", "Chunbo Jiang"], "keywords": ["Current measurement", "Equations", "Hydroelectric power generation", "Mathematical model", "Surface discharges", "Surface treatment", "Velocity measurement", "axisymmetric flow", "particle tracking velocimetry (PTV)", "surface vortex", "tangential velocity", ""], "arnumber": "6076161"}
