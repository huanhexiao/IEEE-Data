An error analysis method, based on the module error model, was used to express the relationship between the module error and the terminal error in the error transmission equation of the reconfigurable parallel manipulator. In addition, an error distribution method using a manufacturing and assembly difficulty coefficient was used to analyze each error module to determine a maximum terminal error. The error distribution result was then used to set up a reconfigurable parallel manipulator. Error experiments with a reconfigurable parallel manipulator show that the error analysis and distribution method for reconfigurable parallel manipulators are effective and the maximum terminal errors of the reconfigurable parallel manipulators are less than 50 urn.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "547", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "544", "date_publication": "Oct. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "547 - 544"}, "authors": ["Rui Yao", "Xiaoqiang Tang", "Tiemin Li", "Chunshen Lin"], "keywords": ["Assembly", "Error analysis", "Joints", "Manipulators", "Mathematical model", "Vectors", "error analysis", "error distributing", "reconfigurable parallel manipulator", ""], "arnumber": "6076159"}
