A mathematical model was developed to simulate the turbulent structure of the flow over the spillway of the Three Gorges Dam at the 145 m reservoir water level to study the aeration characteristics and the gas transport. The model was calibrated and verified with measured data. The analysis of distribution of the aeration and the dissolved oxygen showed that the downstream water level, upstream dissolved oxygen content, and the flow discharge all affect the dissolved oxygen saturation downstream of the sluicing dam. The simulation provides guidance for controlling the dissolved oxygen supersaturation and environmentally friendly operation of the Three Gorges Dam.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "574", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "579", "date_publication": "Oct. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "574 - 579"}, "authors": ["Ling Li", "Chunli Qin", "Qidong Peng", "Zhifeng Yan", "Qianhong Gao"], "keywords": ["Equations", "Floods", "Mathematical model", "Power generation", "Reservoirs", "Rivers", "Three Gorges Dam", "dissolved oxygen content", "environmental hydrodynamics", "spillway", "water-gas two-phase flow", ""], "arnumber": "6076163"}
