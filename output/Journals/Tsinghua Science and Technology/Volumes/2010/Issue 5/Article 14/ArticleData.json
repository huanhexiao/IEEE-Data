It was found that both chemically activated and thermally activated GAG effectively adsorb phenol and 4-cp. More than 800/0 adsorped substrates were later desorpted, showing a reversible sorption behaviour in the GAG. For each activated carbon type, 4-cp was preferentially adsorbed over phenol and the desorption efficiencies of both phenol and 4-cp were found to increase linearly with the initial mass of adsorbate in the adsorbent. The biodegradation of 500 mg/L phenol by Pseudomonas putida took 24 h while the biodegradation of 4-cp took 32 h. Inhibitions during the cometabolic biodegradation of 4-cp and phenol were alleviated by the addition of the GAGs. The system with chemically-activated coconut type GAG had better system stability over thermally-activated peat type GAG. The results show that GAG can be regenerated by the cells enhancement of the cometabolic biotransformation of 4-cp and phenol can be accomplished using chemically-activated coconut type GAG.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "580", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "585", "date_publication": "Oct. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "580 - 585"}, "authors": ["Yi Li", "Ting Rao", "Zhigang Iu"], "keywords": ["Biodegradation", "Biology", "Carbon", "Carbon dioxide", "Degradation", "Substrates", "Suspensions", "4-chlorophenol", "activated carbon", "activation method", "cometabolism", "phenol", "reversible adsorption", ""], "arnumber": "6076164"}
