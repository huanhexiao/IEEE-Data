In this paper, we estimate the implicit value of access to jobs and amenities in Beijing using the hedonic pricing model. The spatial distributions of jobs and amenities in the Beijing Metropolitan Area are quite centralized, supporting the traditional monocentric model in the urban economics literature. Accessibility indices are developed to measure the accessibilities to jobs and amenities of 129 Jiedaos (residential zones). We then employ the hedonic pricing equations to estimate the capitalization effects of these accessibility indices in the prices of new residential properties. The empirical results show that the accessibility indices are important determinants of residential property prices in Beijing, which means that urban residents have a willingness to pay for access to high quality amenities.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "595", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "603", "date_publication": "Oct. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "595 - 603"}, "authors": ["Wenjie Ding", "Siqi Zheng", "Xiaoyang Guo"], "keywords": ["Cities and towns", "Educational institutions", "Hospitals", "Indexes", "Mathematical model", "Pricing", "Urban areas", "accessibility", "amenities", "hedonic pricing model", "jobs", ""], "arnumber": "6076166"}
