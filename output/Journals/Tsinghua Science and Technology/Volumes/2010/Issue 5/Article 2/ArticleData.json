Traditional error modeling methods are usually based on differentiation of kinematic solutions, but the solving process is often complex and has limitations for certain specialized PKMs. A concise numerical error modeling method with the inverse kinematic solution as its only requirement is presented in this paper. To avoid complex Jacobian matrix computations, the difference matrix that can be quickly calculated by kinematic solutions was used to replace the differential matrix. The quasi-Newton method, which has high speed and high precision, was introduced to solve the numerical forward kinematic problem. To verify the efficiency of this numerical error modeling method, three applications in error transformation matrix (ETM) modeling, error analysis, and kinematic calibration were simulated on a 4RRR PKM. A comparison with the results obtained by the traditional method shows that the numerical method is accurate, convenient, and has lower requirements and wider applicability, especially for certain specialized and manufactured PKMs.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "489", "volume": "15", "lastpage": "497", "date_publication": "Oct. 2010", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2010", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "489 - 497"}, "authors": ["Dawei Liu", "Liping Wang", "I Tiemin", "Peng Huang"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Equations", "Jacobian matrices", "Kinematics", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Vectors", "calibratior", "difference matrix", "error model", "error transformation matrix (ETM)", "quasi-Newton method", ""], "arnumber": "6076152"}
