However, IEEE 802.11p-based Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication is still unreliable because of the complicating factors of high vehicle speed and complex radio environments. In this paper, we performed a data-based evaluation of V2V communication reliability, using real-world measurements in a typical urban expressway in Beijing. With respect to the characteristics of the urban expressway and our experimental data, we found road slope and traffic density to be the major environmental factors having a significant impact on the V2V communication's Line-Of-Sight (LOS) conditions. On the basis of these two factors, we propose a fuzzy classification method for the LOS conditions, and separate the realtime communication environments into different LOS cases. For each LOS case, we quantify the metrics as received signal strength indication, packet delivery rate, and communication latency. The results reveal that the communication reliability in urban expressways is very unstable because of the changing LOS conditions. This study provides a useful reference for the IEEE 802.11p-based cooperative systems in urban expressways.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "417", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "428", "date_publication": "August 2015", "inspec": "15571503", "date": "August 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 03 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "417 - 428", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Yizhi Wang", "Jianming Hu", "Yi Zhang", "Chao Xu"], "keywords": ["fuzzy set theory", "pattern classification", "wireless LAN", "IEEE 802.11p-based vehicle-to-vehicle communication", "LOS conditions", "V2V communication reliability", "dedicated short range communication", "fuzzy classification method", "urban expressways", "Environmental factors", "Measurement", "Receivers", "Reliability", "Roads", "Standards", "Vehicles", "IEEE 802.11p", "V2V communication", "empirical measurement", "line-of-sight condition", "urban expressway", ""], "arnumber": "7173456"}
