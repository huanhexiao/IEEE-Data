In this survey, we highlight some advances in the coevolution of CPS, CPSS, and ITS, with an emphasis on traffic data. We first explain the hierarchical architecture of CPS-ITS in terms of five layers: perception, communication, computing, control, and application. Then, we analyze the characteristics of traffic data in CPS-ITS, and enumerate some new technologies for data operation and management. Two typical cases of CPS-ITS, vehicular-communication-based traffic control systems and smart parking systems, are illustrated to describe how CPS is changing our lives and influencing the development of future ITS.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "327", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "335", "date_publication": "August 2015", "inspec": "15583025", "date": "August 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 03 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "327 - 335", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Wei Guo", "Yi Zhang", "Li Li"], "keywords": ["intelligent transportation systems", "traffic control", "CPS computing", "CPS-ITS", "CPSS computing", "cyber-physical-social system computing", "hierarchical architecture", "intelligent transportation system", "smart parking system", "vehicular-communication-based traffic control systems", "Control systems", "Distributed databases", "Optimization", "Real-time systems", "Reliability", "Vehicles", "Cyber-Physical System (CPS)", "Cyber-Physical-Social System (CPSS)", "big data", "intelligent transportation systems", ""], "arnumber": "7173449"}
