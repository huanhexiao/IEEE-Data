In order to ensure algorithm performance, they are typically stored in high-precision formats; this results in a large storage footprint, rendering redistribution costly and difficult. Since for most image and vision applications, pixel values are quantized to 8 bits by the acquisition apparatuses, we show that it is possible to construct a fixed-width, effectively lossless representation of the bases vectors, in the sense that reconstructions from the original bases and from the quantized bases never deviate by more than half of the quantization step-size. In addition to directly applying this result to losslessly compress individual models, we also propose an algorithm to compress appearance models by utilizing prior information on the modeled objects in the form of prior appearance subspaces. Experiments conducted on the compression of person-specific face appearance models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "409", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "416", "date_publication": "August 2015", "inspec": "15571502", "date": "August 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 03 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "409 - 416", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Yang Li", "Xiaoming Tao", "Jianhua Lu"], "keywords": ["computer vision", "face recognition", "image coding", "image reconstruction", "image representation", "image resolution", "principal component analysis", "rendering (computer graphics)", "vector quantisation", "acquisition apparatuses", "appearance variation representation", "bases vectors", "computer vision task", "costly rendering redistribution", "effective lossless subspace appearance model compression", "image processing task", "person-specific face appearance model compression", "pixel value quantization", "principal component analysis", "prior information", "storage footprint", "Analytical models", "Computational modeling", "Data models", "Image coding", "Image reconstruction", "Quantization (signal)", "Training", "appearance modeling", "data compression", "principal component analysis", ""], "arnumber": "7173455"}
