Examples include transportation systems where a group of moving cars communicate in order to avoid collisions, teams of robotic agents that work together in support of disaster recovery, and sensor networks deployed for health-care monitoring, monitoring the operation of a factory plant or to coordinate and actuate mechanisms for energy conservation in a building. These networks may face a variety of threats that puncture their connectivity and, should their performance degrade, the result could be catastrophic. Consider, for example, a vehicular ad hoc network where communication assists collision avoidance. In such a case, degradation could lead to vehicle accidents. Therefore, in order to overcome network performance degradations and the puncture of a network (such as blackhole or jamming) which is under attack, we propose an algorithm called the Fiedler Value Power Adjustment Topology Adaption (FVPATA). FVPATA aims to dynamically adapt an ad hoc network???s topology, even if the attacker varies its location and in the case of an interference-style attack by increasing the interference power. The algorithm utilizes the formulation from the graph theory which works with the Fiedler value to guide each node in wireless ad hoc network utilizing power adjustments to enhance the network???s overall robustness. The advantage of the proposed mechanism is that it is a light-weight approach which is totally distributed, based on topology updates inherent in the Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol and, hence, it is unnecessary to introduce additional messages. Additionally, an algorithm was developed to resolve problems involving asymmetric links that arise in ad hoc networks by eliminating unnecessary energy consumption of Fiedler nodes. Simulation results using NS3 show that the proposed mechanism successfully decreases the average amount of hops used by 50% and - he delay of flows when nodes are migrating at a modest rate below 60 m/min.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "364", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "375", "date_publication": "August 2015", "inspec": "15583027", "date": "August 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 03 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "364 - 375", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Ying Liu", "Wade Trappe"], "keywords": ["computer network security", "peer-to-peer computing", "topology", "vehicular ad hoc networks", "FVPATA", "Fiedler nodes", "Fiedler value", "Fiedler value power adjustment topology adaption", "NS3", "OLSR protocol", "Puncture-Style Attacks", "ad hoc network topology", "collision avoidance", "graph theory", "health-care monitoring", "optimized link state routing protocol", "peer-to-peer communication", "robotic agent", "robust ad hoc cyberphysical network", "vehicle accident", "vehicular ad hoc network", "wireless ad hoc network", "Ad hoc networks", "Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions", "Network topology", "Protocols", "Robustness", "Routing", "Topology", "Fiedler value", "ad hoc networks", "algebraic connectivity", "distributed power control", "topology adaptation", ""], "arnumber": "7173452"}
