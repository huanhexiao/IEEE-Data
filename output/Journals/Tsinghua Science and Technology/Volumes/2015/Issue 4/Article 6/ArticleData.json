The study first introduces the digital, virtual, intelligent trend of airplane assembly and reveals the status and problems of digital airplane assembly studies. The Cyber-Physical System (CPS) structure is then proposed for digital airplane assembly, and the real-time control issues are discussed. Then, the question of realtime control undertaken by a parallel robot is simplified to a control question with bounded time delay and complex interference, and a mathematical description is presented. Next, a robust H\u221e controller with a disturbance degree of decay \u03b3 is designed according to the mathematical description. Finally, a simulation is conducted. All of the experiment results show the feasibility of the above proposed methods.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "376", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "384", "date_publication": "August 2015", "inspec": "15571500", "date": "August 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 03 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "4", "pages": "376 - 384", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Hui Li", "Linxuan Zhang", "Tianyuan Xiao", "Jietao Dong"], "keywords": ["H<sup>&#x221E", "</sup> control", "aircraft", "control system synthesis", "delays", "digital control", "robotic assembly", "robust control", "CPS", "bounded time delay", "complex interference", "cyber-physical system structure", "digital airplane assembly", "disturbance decay degree", "external disturbance", "intelligent airplane assembly", "network time delay", "parallel robot", "real-time controller design method", "robust H-infinity theory", "virtual airplane assembly", "Airplanes", "Assembly", "Atmospheric modeling", "Delay effects", "Parallel robots", "Real-time systems", "Robustness", "cyber physical system", "linear matrix inequality", "network time delay", "robust H-infinity control", ""], "arnumber": "7173453"}
