Traditional analysis methods utilize RNA and depend on single nucleotide polymorphisms, thus to suffer from limited amount of materials for analysis. The rapid development of next-generation sequencing technologies provides more comprehensive and powerful approaches to analyze the genomic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic data, and further to detect and measure allele specific expressions. It will potentially enhance the understanding of the allele specific expressions, their complexities, and the effect on biological processes. In this paper, we extensively review the state-of-art enabling technologies and tools to analyze, detect, and measure allele specific expressions, compare their features, and point out the future trend of the methods.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "513", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "529", "date_publication": "Oct. 2015", "inspec": "15571512", "date": "Oct. 2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Oct 13 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "5", "pages": "513 - 529", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Feng Gu", "Xue Wang"], "keywords": ["RNA", "cellular biophysics", "genomics", "molecular biophysics", "molecular configurations", "polymorphism", "RNA", "allele specific expression analysis", "biological processes", "cellular development", "cellular phenotypes", "cellular programming", "epigenetic data", "genomic data", "next-generation sequencing technologies", "single nucleotide polymorphisms", "traditional analysis methods", "transcriptomic data", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Bioinformatics", "DNA", "Genomics", "Next generation networking", "RNA", "Sequential analysis", "Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)", "Single Nucleotide Variant (SNV)", "allele specific expression", "cellular phenotypes", "sequencing technologies", "statistical methods", "transcripts", ""], "arnumber": "7297750"}
