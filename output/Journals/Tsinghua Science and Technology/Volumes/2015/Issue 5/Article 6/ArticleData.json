Due to the high rate of mutations and low fidelity of HCV replication, resistant strains quickly become dominant in a viral population under the selection pressure of a drug. In this paper, we examined the drug resistance mechanism in the NS5A region of genotype 1a HCV virus by comparing the sequence data from interferon-ribavirin treated and untreated patients. To find the drug resistance difference, we used innovative Bayesian probability models to detect mutation combinations and inferred detailed interaction structures of these mutations. We aim to provide reference to drug design and mutation mechanism understanding through our work.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "484", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "490", "date_publication": "Oct. 2015", "inspec": "15571509", "date": "Oct. 2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Oct 13 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "5", "pages": "484 - 490", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Yao Fu", "Gang Chen", "Lizhi Fu", "Jing Zhang"], "keywords": ["Bayes methods", "drugs", "genetics", "microorganisms", "Bayesian inference", "Bayesian probability models", "Hepatitis C virus treatment", "NS5A region", "drug design", "genotype 1a HCV drug resistance", "interferon-ribavirin patients", "mutation mechanism", "mutations", "resistant strains", "sequence data", "viral population", "Amino acids", "Bayes methods", "Drugs", "Immune system", "Markov processes", "Probability distribution", "Bayesian model", "Hepatitis C virus (HCV)", "NS5A", "drug resistance", ""], "arnumber": "7297747"}
