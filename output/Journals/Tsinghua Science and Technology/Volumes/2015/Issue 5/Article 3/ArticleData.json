However, because of limited known genome sequences, noisy data, incomplete ion sequences, and the accuracy of protein identification, it is challenging to identify peptides using tandem mass spectral data. Noise filtering and removing thus play a key role in accurate peptide identification from tandem mass spectra. In this paper, we employ a Bayesian model to identify proteins based on the prior information of bond cleavages. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm is used to simulate candidate peptides from the posterior distribution and to estimate the parameters for the Bayesian model. Our simulation and computational experimental results show that the model can identify peptide with a higher accuracy.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "453", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "459", "date_publication": "Oct. 2015", "inspec": "15571506", "date": "Oct. 2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Oct 13 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "5", "pages": "453 - 459", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Hui Li", "Chunmei Liu", "Mugizi Robert Rwebangira", "Legand Burge"], "keywords": ["Bayes methods", "Markov processes", "Monte Carlo methods", "bonds (chemical)", "mass spectra", "molecular biophysics", "molecular configurations", "proteins", "proteomics", "Bayesian model", "MCMC model", "Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm", "bond cleavages", "genome sequences", "ion sequences", "mass peaks", "noise filtering", "noise removal", "noisy data", "peptide identification", "posterior distribution", "protein identification", "proteomics", "tandem mass spectral data", "Accuracy", "Bayes methods", "Markov processes", "Noise", "Noise measurement", "Peptides", "Proteins", "Fourier transform", "Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)", "mass spectrometry", "noise filtering", ""], "arnumber": "7297744"}
