The features of this methodology are as follows: (1) A Bayesian Ying-Yang Learning (BYYL) algorithm is used to construct a compact but high-performance system automatically. (2) A novel multi-objective T2FBYYL is presented that integrates the T2 fuzzy theory with BYYL to automatically construct its best structure and better tackle various data uncertainty problems simultaneously. (3) The weighted sum multi-objective optimization technique with combinations of different weightings is implemented to achieve the best trade-off among multiple objectives in the T2FBYYL. The proposed methods are applied to electric load forecast using a real operational dataset collected from Macao electric utility. The test results reveal that the proposed method is superior to other existing relevant techniques.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "164", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "174", "date_publication": "April 2015", "inspec": "15571485", "date": "April 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Apr 23 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "2", "pages": "164 - 174", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Mingchui Dong", "Chinwang Lou"], "keywords": ["Bayes methods", "fuzzy set theory", "learning (artificial intelligence)", "load forecasting", "neural nets", "optimisation", "Macao electric utility", "SDSA-FNN-T2FBYYL algorithm", "adaptive electric load forecaster", "data uncertainty problem", "self-developing and self-adaptive fuzzy neural network", "type-2 fuzzy Bayesian ying-yang learning", "weighted sum multiobjective optimization technique", "Bayes methods", "Fuzzy neural networks", "Input variables", "Load forecasting", "Mathematical model", "Optimization", "Uncertainty", "Bayesian Ying-Yang learning algorithm", "load forecaster", "type-2 fuzzy theory", ""], "arnumber": "7085629"}
