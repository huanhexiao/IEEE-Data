This paper considers the allocation of network error correction flow on a network that consists of disjoint paths from the source node to the destination node. Specifically, we propose an algorithm of allocating the path-flows to support the given rate with minimum cost. Our analysis shows that the asymptotic time complexity of this algorithm is linearithmic, and this algorithm is optimal in general.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "182", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "187", "date_publication": "April 2015", "inspec": "15571487", "date": "April 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Apr 23 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "2", "pages": "182 - 187", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Zhiqing Xiao", "Yunzhou Li", "Jing Wang"], "keywords": ["error correction", "telecommunication network reliability", "asymptotic time complexity", "disjoint paths", "network error correction flow", "network survivability", "Error correction", "Error correction codes", "Optimized production technology", "Resource management", "Time complexity", "Zirconium", "disjoint paths", "maximum distance separable codes", "network error correction", "network survivability", ""], "arnumber": "7085631"}
