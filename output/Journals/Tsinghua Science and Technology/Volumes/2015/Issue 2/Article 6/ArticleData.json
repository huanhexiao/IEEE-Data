By giving up this uniform-spacing feature, we propose an APSK optimization method based on the uniform APSK with Gray labeling (Gray-APSK). The aim of the optimization is to maximize the Generalized Mutual Information (GMI) of Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) for the targeted code rate and channel. We show that our optimized non-uniform APSK could offer further performance gain compared with the conventional uniform Gray-APSK and considerably outperforms the traditional quadrature amplitude modulation at the targeted SNR and channel.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "175", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "181", "date_publication": "April 2015", "inspec": "15571486", "date": "April 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Apr 23 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "2", "pages": "175 - 181", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Keqian Yan", "Kewu Peng", "Fang Yang", "Jian Song"], "keywords": ["amplitude shift keying", "optimisation", "phase shift keying", "BICM systems", "amplitude phase shift keying", "bit-interleaved coded modulation", "generalized mutual information", "gray labeling", "nonuniform APSK optimization method", "AWGN", "Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM)", "geometrical shaping", "mutual information", "non-uniform Amplitude Phase Shift Keying (APSK)", ""], "arnumber": "7085630"}
