The notion of consensus is extended to networks containing antagonistic interactions modeled by negative weights on the communication graph. A unified framework is established to address both the stationary and dynamic consensus issues in sampled-data settings. Using the reciprocally convex approach, a sufficient condition for consensus is derived in terms of matrix inequalities. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed result.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "205", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "211", "date_publication": "April 2015", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Apr 23 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "2", "pages": "205 - 211"}, "authors": ["Bo Hou", "Fuchun Sun", "Hongbo Li", "Guangbin Liu"], "keywords": ["Delays", "Linear matrix inequalities", "Multi-agent systems", "Symmetric matrices", "Time-varying systems", "Topology", "Upper bound", "consensus", "cooperation and competition", "multi-agent systems", "second-order", ""], "arnumber": "7085634"}
