Compared with RBF, HBF neural networks have a more generalized ability with different activation functions. A decision tree algorithm is used to determine the network center. Subsequently, we design an adaptive observer based on HBF neural networks and propose a fault detection and diagnosis method based on the observer for the nonlinear modeling ability of the neural network. Finally, we apply this method to nonlinear systems. The sensitivity and stability of the observer for the failure of the nonlinear systems are proved by simulation, which is beneficial for real-time online fault detection and diagnosis.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "200", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "204", "date_publication": "April 2015", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Apr 23 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "2", "pages": "200 - 204"}, "authors": ["Xin Wen", "Xingwang Zhang", "Yaping Zhu"], "keywords": ["Biological neural networks", "Fault detection", "Fault diagnosis", "Neurons", "Nonlinear systems", "Observers", "fault detection", "hyper basis function", "neural networks", "observer", ""], "arnumber": "7085633"}
