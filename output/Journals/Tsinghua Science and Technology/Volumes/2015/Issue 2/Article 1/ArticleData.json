As an important information source from the demand side, Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) has gained increasing popularity all over the world. By making full use of the data gathered by AMI, stakeholders of the electrical industry can have a better understanding of electrical consumption behavior. This is a significant strategy to improve operation efficiency and enhance power grid reliability. To implement this strategy, researchers have explored many data mining techniques for load profiling. This paper performs a state-of-the-art, comprehensive review of these data mining techniques from the perspectives of different technical approaches including direct clustering, indirect clustering, clustering evaluation criteria, and customer segmentation. On this basis, the prospects for implementing load profiling to demand response applications, price-based and incentive-based, are further summarized. Finally, challenges and opportunities of load profiling techniques in future power industry, especially in a demand response world, are discussed.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "117", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "129", "date_publication": "April 2015", "inspec": "15571481", "date": "April 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Apr 23 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "2", "pages": "117 - 129", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Yi Wang", "Qixin Chen", "Chongqing Kang", "Mingming Zhang", "Ke Wang", "Yun Zhao"], "keywords": ["data mining", "demand side management", "electricity supply industry", "load flow", "pattern clustering", "power grids", "power meters", "power system analysis computing", "smart power grids", "AMI", "advanced metering infrastructure", "clustering evaluation criteria", "customer segmentation", "data gathering", "data mining techniques", "demand response applications", "demand side", "direct clustering", "electrical consumption behavior", "electrical generation", "electrical industry", "future power industry", "indirect clustering", "information source", "load profiling techniques", "operation efficiency improvement", "power grid reliability enhancement", "smart grid", "two-way information flow", "two-way power flow", "Clustering methods", "Data mining", "Feature extraction", "Hidden Markov models", "Load management", "Smart grids", "Time series analysis", "Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)", "customer segmentation", "data mining", "demand response", "load profiling", ""], "arnumber": "7085625"}
