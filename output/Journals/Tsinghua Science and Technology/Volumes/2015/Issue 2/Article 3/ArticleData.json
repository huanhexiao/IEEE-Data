Although many methods have been developed on traditional power systems to address this issue, the past cascading failure events showed the ineffectiveness of these methods. With the development of Smart Grid (SG), new agent-based methods have been proposed to address this issue by utilizing SG real-time communications. We found that these solutions simply assume ideal communication networks and do not consider the effect of practical network constraints and resource management. In this paper, we propose several solutions to address practical network resource management and constraints, and further improve the agent-based solutions in order to prevent the false tripping of zone 3 relays in various conditions. We also analyze the potential issues of these solutions, and point out the future investigation in this direction.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "142", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "154", "date_publication": "April 2015", "inspec": "15571483", "date": "April 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Apr 23 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "2", "pages": "142 - 154", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Jiapeng Zhang", "Yingfei Dong"], "keywords": ["failure analysis", "multi-agent systems", "power system analysis computing", "power system faults", "power system protection", "relay protection", "smart power grids", "SG real-time communications", "agent-based methods", "cascading blackouts", "false trip prevention", "ideal communication networks", "network resource constraints", "network resource management", "power systems", "remote zone 3 protection relays", "smart grid development", "Bandwidth", "Communication networks", "Delays", "Power transmission lines", "Relays", "Smart grids", "cascading failure", "real-time communications", "smart grid", "zone 3 relay", ""], "arnumber": "7085627"}
