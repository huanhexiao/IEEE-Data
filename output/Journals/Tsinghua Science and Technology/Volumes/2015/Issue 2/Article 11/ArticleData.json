In this paper we provide a practical approach to do so. We present a semi-automatic way to verify FPGA VHDL software deadlocks, especially those that reside in automata. A domain is defined to represent the VHDL modules that will be verified; these modules will be transformed into Verilog models and be verified by SMV tools. By analyzing the verification results of SMV, deadlocks can be found; after looking back to the VHDL code, the deadlocking code is located and the problem is solved. VHDL verification is particularly important in safety-critical software. As an example, our solution is applied to a Multifunction Vehicle Bus Controller (MVBC) system for a train. The safety properties were tested well in the development stage, but experienced a breakdown during the long-term software testing stage, which was mainly caused by deadlocks in the VHDL software. In this special case, we managed to locate the VHDL deadlocks and solve the problem by the FPGA deadlock detection approach provided in this paper, which demonstrates that our solution works well.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "212", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "218", "date_publication": "April 2015", "inspec": "15571488", "date": "April 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Apr 23 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "2", "pages": "212 - 218", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Dexi Wang", "Fei He", "Yangdong Deng", "Chao Su", "Ming Gu", "Jiaguang Sun"], "keywords": ["field programmable gate arrays", "formal verification", "hardware description languages", "logic CAD", "program testing", "safety-critical software", "system recovery", "FPGA design", "MVBC", "SMV tools", "VHDL verification", "VHSIC hardware description language", "deadlock detection", "deadlocking code", "field-programmable gate array", "formal verification", "long-term software testing stage", "multifunction vehicle bus controller system", "safety-critical software", "Automata", "Field programmable gate arrays", "Hardware", "Hardware design languages", "Monitoring", "Software", "System recovery", "Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)", "Multifunction Vehicle Bus Controller (MVBC)", "VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL)", "deadlocks", "verification", ""], "arnumber": "7085635"}
