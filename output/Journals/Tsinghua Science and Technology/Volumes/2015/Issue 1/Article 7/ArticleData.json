However, because of existence of schedulers in both the hypervisor and the guest VMs, this creates a new research problem, viz., double scheduling. Although double scheduling may cause many issues including lock-holder preemption, vCPU stacking, CPU fragmentation, and priority inversion, prior approaches have either introduced new problems and/or addressed the problem incompletely. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of FlexCore, a new scheduling scheme using vCPU ballooning, which dynamically adjusts the number of vCPUs of a VM at runtime. This essentially eliminates unnecessary scheduling in the hypervisor layer, and thus, boosts performance significantly. An evaluation using a complete KVM-based implementation shows that the average performance improvement for PARSEC applications on a 12-core Intel machine is approximately 52.9%, ranging from 35.4% to 79.6%.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "7", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Feb. 2015", "inspec": "15583020", "date": "Feb. 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 12 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "7 - 16", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Tianxiang Miao", "Haibo Chen"], "keywords": ["multiprocessing systems", "performance evaluation", "virtual machines", "12-core Intel machine", "CPU fragmentation", "FlexCore", "KVM", "PARSEC application", "SMP virtual machine", "SMP-VM", "VCPU ballooning", "double scheduling", "dynamic virtual machine scheduling", "lock-holder preemption", "multicore processor", "vCPU stacking", "Dynamic scheduling", "Job shop scheduling", "Kernel", "Processor scheduling", "Receivers", "Virtual machine monitors", "Virtual machining", "SMP virtual machine", "multicore processor", "vCPU ballooning", "virtualization", ""], "arnumber": "7040515"}
