Tenants run applications on their allocated VMs, and the network distance between a tenant's VMs may considerably impact the tenant's Quality of Service (QoS). In this study, we define and formulate the multi-tenant VM allocation problem in cloud data centers, considering the VM requirements of different tenants, and introducing the allocation goal of minimizing the sum of the VMs' network diameters of all tenants. Then, we propose a Layered Progressive resource allocation algorithm for multi-tenant cloud data centers based on the Multiple Knapsack Problem (LP-MKP). The LP-MKP algorithm uses a multi-stage layered progressive method for multi-tenant VM allocation and efficiently handles unprocessed tenants at each stage. This reduces resource fragmentation in cloud data centers, decreases the differences in the QoS among tenants, and improves tenants' overall QoS in cloud data centers. We perform experiments to evaluate the LP-MKP algorithm and demonstrate that it can provide significant gains over other allocation algorithms.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "81", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "89", "date_publication": "Feb. 2015", "inspec": "15571479", "date": "Feb. 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 12 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "81 - 89", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Jiaxin Li", "Dongsheng Li", "Yuming Ye", "Xicheng Lu"], "keywords": ["cloud computing", "computer centres", "knapsack problems", "quality of service", "resource allocation", "virtual machines", "LP-MKP algorithm", "QoS", "VM requirements", "cloud data centers", "infrastructure services", "layered progressive resource allocation algorithm", "multiple knapsack problem", "multistage layered progressive method", "multitenant VM allocation problem", "multitenant virtual machine allocation", "network distance", "quality of service", "Approximation algorithms", "Approximation methods", "Cloud computing", "Quality of service", "Resource management", "Vegetation", "Virtual machining", "cloud data center", "multiple knapsack problem", "multiple tenants", "virtual machine allocation", ""], "arnumber": "7040517"}
