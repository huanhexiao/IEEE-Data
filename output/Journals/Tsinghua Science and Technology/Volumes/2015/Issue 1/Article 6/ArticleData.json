In this paper, we present an efficient system for managing and analyzing PB level structured data called Banian. Banian overcomes the storage structure limitation of relational database and effectively integrates interactive query with large-scale storage management. It provides a uniform query interface for cross-platform datasets and thus shows favorable compatibility and scalability. Banian's system architecture mainly includes three layers: (1) a storage layer using HDFS for the distributed storage of massive data; (2) a scheduling and execution layer employing the splitting and scheduling technology of parallel database; and (3) an application layer providing a cross-platform query interface and supporting standard SQL. We evaluate Banian using PB level Internet data and the TPC-H benchmark. The results show that when compared with Hive, Banian improves the query performance to a maximum of 30 times and achieves better scalability and concurrency.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "62", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "71", "date_publication": "Feb. 2015", "inspec": "15571477", "date": "Feb. 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 12 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "62 - 71", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Tao Xu", "Dongsheng Wang", "Guodong Liu"], "keywords": ["Big Data", "Internet", "interactive systems", "parallel databases", "query processing", "relational databases", "scheduling", "storage management", "Banian system architecture", "HDFS", "Hive", "PB level Internet data", "PB level structured data", "SQL", "TPC-H benchmark", "cross-platform interactive query system", "cross-platform query interface", "distributed storage", "interactive query", "large-scale storage management", "parallel database scheduling technology", "query interface", "relational database", "storage structure limitation", "structured big data", "Big data", "Computer architecture", "Engines", "Relational databases", "Scalability", "Servers", "HDFS", "big data", "cross platform", "interactive query", "relational database", ""], "arnumber": "7040514"}
