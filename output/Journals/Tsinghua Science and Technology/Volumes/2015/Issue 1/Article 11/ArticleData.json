Internet Traffic Archival Systems (ITAS) for packets or flow records have become more and more widely used in network monitoring, network troubleshooting, and user behavior and experience analysis. Among the three key technologies in ITAS, we focus on bitmap index compression algorithm and give a detailed survey in this paper. The current state-of-the-art bitmap index encoding schemes include: BBC, WAH, PLWAH, EWAH, PWAH, CONCISE, COMPAX, VLC, DF-WAH, and VAL-WAH. Based on differences in segmentation, chunking, merge compress, and Near Identical (NI) features, we provide a thorough categorization of the state-of-the-art bitmap index compression algorithms. We also propose some new bitmap index encoding algorithms, such as SECOMPAX, ICX, MASC, and PLWAH+, and present the state diagrams for their encoding algorithms. We then evaluate their CPU and GPU implementations with a real Internet trace from CAIDA. Finally, we summarize and discuss the future direction of bitmap index compression algorithms. Beyond the application in network security and network forensic, bitmap index compression with faster bitwise-logical operations and reduced search space is widely used in analysis in genome data, geographical information system, graph databases, image retrieval, Internet of things, etc. It is expected that bitmap index compression will thrive and be prosperous again in Big Data era since 1980s.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "100", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "115", "date_publication": "Feb. 2015", "inspec": "15571480", "date": "Feb. 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 12 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "100 - 115", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Zhen Chen", "Yuhao Wen", "Junwei Cao", "Wenxun Zheng", "Jiahui Chang", "Yinjun Wu", "Ge Ma", "Mourad Hakmaoui", "Guodong Peng"], "keywords": ["Big Data", "Internet", "computer network security", "data compression", "mobile computing", "telecommunication traffic", "BBC", "CAIDA", "COMPAX", "CONCISE", "CPU implementations", "DF-WAH", "EWAH", "GPU implementations", "ICX", "ITAS", "Internet applications", "Internet of things", "Internet traffic archival systems", "MASC", "PLWAH", "PLWAH+", "PWAH", "SECOMPAX", "VAL-WAH", "VLC", "WAH", "big data", "bitmap index compression algorithms", "bitwise-logical operations", "experience analysis", "genome data", "geographical information system", "graph databases", "image retrieval", "merge compress", "mobile Internet", "network forensic", "network monitoring", "network security", "network troubleshooting", "reduced search space", "state diagrams", "user behavior", "Compression algorithms", "Educational institutions", "IP networks", "Indexing", "Internet", "Ports (Computers)", "Internet traffic", "big data", "bitmap compression algorithm", "bitmap index", "network security", "traffic archival", ""], "arnumber": "7040519"}
