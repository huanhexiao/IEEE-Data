Timbre components are employed as the model???s main feature. To compute timbre similarity, extracting the spectrum features for each frame is necessary; the large set of frames is clustered using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and expectation maximization. The typical spectra frame from GMM is drawn as data points, and MR assigns each data point a relative ranking score, which is treated as a distance instead of as traditional similarity metrics based on pair-wise distance. Furthermore, the MR algorithm can be easily generalized by adding positive and negative examples from the RF algorithm and improves the final result. Experimental results show that the proposed approach effectively improves the ranking capabilities of existing distance functions.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "613", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "619", "date_publication": "December 2015", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "December 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Dec 17 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "613 - 619"}, "authors": ["Jing Qin", "Xinyue Liu", "Hongfei Lin"], "keywords": ["Clustering algorithms", "Feature extraction", "Information retrieval", "Manifolds", "Radio frequency", "Semantics", "audio information retrieval", "manifold ranking", "relevance feedback", ""], "arnumber": "7350013"}
