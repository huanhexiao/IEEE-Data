The problem is formulated as a mixed integer optimization problem, which is difficult to solve. To overcome this problem, a joint user selection and rate adaptation scheme is developed based on the water-filling rate adaptation with the given user set and the power saving criterion with the allocated rates. Numerical results demonstrate that compared with the norm-based and semi-orthogonal user selection algorithms, the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the total power consumption. The proposed algorithm can also achieve near-optimal performance compared with the performance achieved by the exhaustive search-based method. In addition, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is reduced by heuristic iteration and search scope shrinking.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "574", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "582", "date_publication": "December 2015", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "December 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Dec 17 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "574 - 582"}, "authors": ["Dong Wang", "Bo Bai", "Wei Chen"], "keywords": ["Antennas", "Array signal processing", "Computer architecture", "Interference", "Minimization", "Power demand", "Quality of service", "coordinated multipoint transmission", "user selection", "rate adaptation", "backhaul capacity", ""], "arnumber": "7349929"}
