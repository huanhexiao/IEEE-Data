How to select the optimal composited service from thousands of functionally equivalent services but different Quality of Service (QoS ) attributes has become a hot research in service computing. As a consequence, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm MR-IDPSO (MapReduce based on Improved Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization), which makes use of the improved discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with the MapReduce to solve large-scale dynamic service composition. Experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the parallel genetic algorithm in terms of solution quality and is efficient for large-scale dynamic service composition. In addition, the experimental results also demonstrate that the performance of MR-IDPSO becomes more better with increasing number of candidate services.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "602", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "612", "date_publication": "December 2015", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "December 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Dec 17 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "602 - 612"}, "authors": ["Yanping Zhang", "Zihui Jing", "Yiwen Zhang"], "keywords": ["Cloud computing", "Genetic algorithms", "Heuristic algorithms", "Particle swarm optimization", "Programming", "Quality of service", "Signal processing algorithms", "MapReduce", "service composition", "Quality of Service (QoS)", "parallel particle swarm optimization", ""], "arnumber": "7349932"}
