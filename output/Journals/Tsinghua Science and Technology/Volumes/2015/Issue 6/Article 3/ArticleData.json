In order to reduce the latency of accessing such (key, value) pairs, an in-memory cache system is usually deployed between the front-end Web system and the back-end database system. In practice, a cache system may consist of a number of server nodes, and fault tolerance is a critical feature to maintain the latency Service-Level Agreements (SLAs). In this paper, we present the design, implementation, analysis, and evaluation of R-Memcached, a reliable in-memory key-value cache system that is built on top of the popular Memcached software. R-Memcached exploits coding techniques to achieve reliability, and can tolerate up to two node failures. Our experimental results show that R-Memcached can maintain very good latency and throughput performance even during the period of node failures.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "560", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "573", "date_publication": "December 2015", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "December 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Dec 17 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issue": "6", "pages": "560 - 573"}, "authors": ["Chengjian Liu", "Kai Ouyang", "Xiaowen Chu", "Hai Liu", "Yiu-Wing Leung"], "keywords": ["Databases", "Encoding", "Redundancy", "Servers", "Throughput", "Web services", "in-memory cache", "fault tolerance", "key-value store", ""], "arnumber": "7349928"}
