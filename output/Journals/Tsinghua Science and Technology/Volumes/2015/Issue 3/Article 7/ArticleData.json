Along with the extensive applications of FCMs, there are some limitations that emerge due to the deficiencies associated with FCM itself. In order to eliminate these deficiencies, we propose an unsupervised dynamic fuzzy cognitive map using behaviors and nonlinear relationships. In this model, we introduce dynamic weights and trend-effects to make the model more reasonable. Data credibility is also considered while establishing a machine learning model. Subsequently, we develop an optimized Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA) for weight learning. Experimental results show the practicability of the dynamic FCM model. In comparison to the other existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm has better performance in terms of convergence and stability.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "285", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "292", "date_publication": "June 2015", "inspec": "15583024", "date": "June 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "285 - 292", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Boyuan Liu", "Wenhui Fan", "Tianyuan Xiao"], "keywords": ["cognition", "data analysis", "inference mechanisms", "knowledge representation", "unsupervised learning", "EDA", "FCM model", "convergence", "cyclic digraph", "data credibility", "estimation-of-distribution algorithm", "inference network", "knowledge reasoning", "knowledge representation", "machine learning model", "unsupervised dynamic FCM", "unsupervised dynamic fuzzy cognitive map", "weight learning", "Estimation", "Heuristic algorithms", "Machine learning algorithms", "Optimization", "Roads", "Sociology", "Statistics", "Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA)", "Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM)", "machine learning", "nonlinear relation", ""], "arnumber": "7128941"}
