Many researchers have demonstrated prototypes using graphene-based materials, but few specific applications have appeared. Graphene-based acoustic devices have become a popular topic. This paper describes a novel method to fabricate graphene-based earphones by laser scribing. The earphones have been used in wireless communication systems. A wireless communication system was built based on an ARM board. Voice from a mobile phone was transmitted to a graphene-based earphone. The output sound had a similar wave envelope to that of the input; some differences were introduced by the DC bias added to the driving circuit of the graphene-based earphone. The graphene-based earphone was demonstrated to have a great potential in wireless communication.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "270", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "276", "date_publication": "June 2015", "inspec": "15571494", "date": "June 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "270 - 276", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Luqi Tao", "Song Jiang", "Cheng Li", "He Tian", "Ningqin Deng", "Danyang Wang", "Yi Yang", "Tian-Ling Ren"], "keywords": ["graphene devices", "radio networks", "ARM board", "graphene-based acoustic devices", "graphene-based earphones", "mobile phone", "wireless communication system", "Copper", "Graphene", "Headphones", "Mobile handsets", "Monitoring", "Universal Serial Bus", "Wireless communication", "ARM", "communication", "earphone", "graphene", ""], "arnumber": "7128939"}
