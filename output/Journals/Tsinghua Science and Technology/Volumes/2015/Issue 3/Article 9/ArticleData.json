In response to the problem of the poor efficiency of general link prediction methods applied to brain networks, this paper proposes a hierarchical random graph model based on maximum likelihood estimation. This algorithm uses brain network data to create a hierarchical random graph model. Then, it samples the space of all possible dendrograms using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Finally, it calculates the average connection probability. It also employs an evaluation index. Comparing link prediction in a brain network with link prediction in three different networks (Treponemapallidum metabolic network, terrorist networks, and grassland species food webs) using the hierarchical random graph model, experimental results show that the algorithm applied to the brain network has the highest prediction accuracy in terms of AUC scores. With the increase of network scale, AUC scores of the brain network reach 0.8 before gradually leveling off. In addition, the results show AUC scores of various algorithms computed in networks of eight different scales in 28 normal people. They show that the HRG algorithm is far better than random prediction and the ACT global index, and slightly inferior to local indexes CN and LP. Although the HRG algorithm does not produce the best results, its forecast effect is obvious, and shows good time complexity.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "306", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "315", "date_publication": "June 2015", "inspec": "15571497", "date": "June 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "306 - 315", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Yanli Yang", "Hao Guo", "Tian Tian", "Haifang Li"], "keywords": ["Markov processes", "Monte Carlo methods", "brain", "graph theory", "maximum likelihood estimation", "network theory (graphs)", "random processes", "ACT global index", "AUC scores", "HRG algorithm", "Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm", "Treponemapallidum metabolic network", "average connection probability", "brain networks", "evaluation index", "general link prediction methods", "grassland species food webs", "hierarchical random graph model", "local CN index", "local LP index", "maximum likelihood estimation", "node attributes", "observed links", "terrorist networks", "Brain modeling", "Complex networks", "Computational modeling", "Correlation", "Prediction algorithms", "Predictive models", "brain network", "hierarchical random graph", "link prediction", "maximum likelihood estimation method", ""], "arnumber": "7128943"}
