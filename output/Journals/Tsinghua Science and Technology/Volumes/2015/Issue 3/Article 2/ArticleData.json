How to assign a set of documents to a distributed file system, which can not only reduce storage space, but also ensure the access efficiency as much as possible, is an urgent problem which needs to be solved. Space-efficiency mainly uses data de-duplication technologies, while access-efficiency requires gathering the files with high similarity on a server. Based on the study of other data de-duplication technologies, especially the Similarity-Aware Partitioning (SAP) algorithm, this paper proposes the Frequency and Similarity-Aware Partitioning (FSAP) algorithm for cloud storage. The FSAP algorithm is a more reasonable data partitioning algorithm than the SAP algorithm. Meanwhile, this paper proposes the Space-Time Utility Maximization Model (STUMM), which is useful in balancing the relationship between space-efficiency and access-efficiency. Finally, this paper uses 100 web files downloaded from CNN for testing, and the results show that, relative to using the algorithms associated with the SAP algorithm (including the SAP-Space-Delta algorithm and the SAP-Space-Dedup algorithm), the FSAP algorithm based on STUMM reaches higher compression ratio and a more balanced distribution of data blocks.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "233", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "245", "date_publication": "June 2015", "inspec": "15571490", "date": "June 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "233 - 245", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Jianjiang Li", "Jie Wu", "Zhanning Ma"], "keywords": ["cloud computing", "data compression", "distributed databases", "redundancy", "storage allocation", "CNN", "FSAP algorithm", "SAP-space-dedup algorithm", "SAP-space-delta algorithm", "STUMM", "Web file download", "access efficiency", "cloud services", "cloud storage systems", "compression ratio", "data block distribution", "data de-duplication technologies", "distributed file system", "frequency similarity-aware partitioning", "redundant data problem", "similarity-aware partitioning", "space-efficiency", "space-time utility maximization model", "storage space reduction", "Cloud computing", "Economics", "Industries", "Partitioning algorithms", "Redundancy", "Servers", "cloud storage", "de-duplication", "frequency", "redundancy", ""], "arnumber": "7128935"}
