Online transaction platforms provide a highly convenient channel for consumers to generate and retrieve product reviews. In addition, consumers can also vote reviews perceived to be helpful in making their decision. However, due to diverse characteristics, consumers can have different preferences on products and reviews. Their voting behavior can be influenced by reviews and existing review votes. To explore the influence mechanism of the reviewer, the review, and the existing votes on review helpfulness, we propose three hypotheses based on the consumer perspective and perform statistical tests to verify these hypotheses with real review data from Amazon. Our empirical study indicates that review helpfulness has significant correlation and trend with reviewers, review valance, and review votes. In this paper, we also discuss the implications of our findings on consumer preference and review helpfulness.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "293", "volume": "20", "lastpage": "305", "date_publication": "June 2015", "inspec": "15571496", "date": "June 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "293 - 305", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Yuanlin Chen", "Yueting Chai", "Yi Liu", "Yang Xu"], "keywords": ["consumer behaviour", "decision making", "statistical testing", "Amazon", "consumer perspective", "consumer preference", "online transaction platforms", "product reviews", "purchase decision making", "review helpfulness", "review valance", "review votes", "reviewer influence mechanism", "statistical tests", "voting behavior", "Biological system modeling", "Decision making", "Economics", "Market research", "Motion pictures", "Product design", "Quality assessment", "behavior analysis", "consumer preference", "online decision making", "review helpfulness", ""], "arnumber": "7128942"}
