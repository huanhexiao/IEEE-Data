To prevent man-in-the-middle and denial of service attacks caused by an address resolution protocol bug in an SDN-based cloud center, this study proposed a Bayes-based algorithm to calculate the probability of a host being an attacker and further presented a detection model based on the algorithm. Experiments were conducted to validate this method.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "17", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "Feb. 2016", "inspec": "15823463", "date": "Feb. 2016", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 04 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "17 - 28", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Huan Ma", "Hao Ding", "Yang Yang", "Zhenqiang Mi", "James Yifei Yang", "Zenggang Xiong"], "keywords": ["Bayes methods", "cloud computing", "computer centres", "computer debugging", "computer network performance evaluation", "computer network security", "software defined networking", "Bayes-based ARP attack detection algorithm", "SDN-based cloud center", "address resolution protocol bug", "host probability calculation", "internal network security", "network attacks", "network performance improvement", "software-defined network technology", "Cloud computing", "IP networks", "Prediction algorithms", "Probability", "Protocols", "Security", "Servers", "ARP attack detection", "Bayes", "cloud computing", "software-defined network", ""], "arnumber": "7399280"}
