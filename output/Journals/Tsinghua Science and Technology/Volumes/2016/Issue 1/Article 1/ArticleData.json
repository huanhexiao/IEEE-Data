We crawled an almost complete Weibo user network that contains 222 million users and 27 billion links in 2013. This paper analyzes the structural properties of this network, and compares it with a Twitter user network. The topological properties we studied include the degree distributions, connected components, distance distributions, reciprocity, clustering coefficient, PageRank centrality, and degree assortativity. We find that Weibo users have a higher diversity index, higher Gini index, but a lower reciprocity and clustering coefficient for most of the nodes. A surprising observation is that the reciprocity of Weibo is only about a quarter of the reciprocity of the Twitter user network. We also show that Weibo adoption rate correlates with economic development positively, and Weibo network can be used to quantify the connections between provinces and regions in China. In particular, point-wise mutual information is shown to be accurate in quantifying the strength of connections. We developed an interactive analyzing software framework for this study, and released the data and code online.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "16", "date_publication": "Feb. 2016", "inspec": "15823470", "date": "Feb. 2016", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 04 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "1 - 16", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Wentao Han", "Xiaowei Zhu", "Ziyan Zhu", "Wenguang Chen", "Weimin Zheng", "Jianguo Lu"], "keywords": ["pattern clustering", "social networking (online)", "software engineering", "topology", "China", "PageRank centrality", "Twitter user network", "Weibo user network", "clustering coefficient", "comparative analysis", "degree assortativity", "degree distribution", "distance distribution", "higher Gini index", "higher diversity index", "point-wise mutual information", "software framework development", "structural property analysis", "topological property", "Economics", "Indexes", "Mutual information", "Sociology", "Statistics", "Twitter", "Twitter", "Weibo", "complex network", "mutual information", "online social network", ""], "arnumber": "7399279"}
