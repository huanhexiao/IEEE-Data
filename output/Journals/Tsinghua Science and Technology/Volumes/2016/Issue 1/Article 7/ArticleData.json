Users must be able to access all available services continuously equipped with mobile devices or smart objects without being impacted by technical constraints such as performance or memory issues, regardless of their physical location and mobility. To achieve this goal, we propose the use of cloudlet-based architecture that serves as distributed cloud resources with specific ranges of influence and a realtime processing framework that tracks events and preferences of the end consumers, predicts their requirements, and recommends services to optimize resource utilization and service response time.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "80", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "88", "date_publication": "Feb. 2016", "inspec": "15823461", "date": "Feb. 2016", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 04 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "80 - 88", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["O.
