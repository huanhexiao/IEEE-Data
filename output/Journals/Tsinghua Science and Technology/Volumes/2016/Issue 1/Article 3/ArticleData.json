An object can dominate another object if it is not worse than the other object on all attributes and is better than the other object on at least one attribute. If an object cannot be dominated by any other object, it is a skyline object. The skyline group problem involves finding k-item groups that cannot be dominated by any other k-item group. Existing algorithms designed to find skyline groups can only process static data. However, data changes as a stream with time in many applications, and algorithms should be designed to support skyline group queries on dynamic data. In this paper, we propose new algorithms to find skyline groups over a data stream. We use data structures, namely a hash table, dominance graph, and matrix, to store dominance information and update results incrementally. We conduct experiments on synthetic datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms. The experimental results show that our algorithms can efficiently find skyline groups over a data stream.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "29", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "39", "date_publication": "Feb. 2016", "inspec": "15823469", "date": "Feb. 2016", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 04 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "29 - 39", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Xi Guo", "Hailing Li", "Aziguli Wulamu", "Yonghong Xie", "Yajing Fu"], "keywords": ["data structures", "matrix algebra", "query processing", "Skyline group query processing", "data stream", "data structures", "dominance graph", "dominance information storage", "hash table", "k-item groups", "static data processing", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Computational modeling", "Data models", "Data structures", "Dynamic programming", "Heuristic algorithms", "Query processing", "data streams", "query processing", "skyline", "skyline group", ""], "arnumber": "7399281"}
