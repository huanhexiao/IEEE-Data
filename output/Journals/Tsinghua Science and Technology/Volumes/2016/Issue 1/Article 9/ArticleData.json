In this emerging model, computing resources such as software, hardware, networking, and storage can be accessed anywhere in the world on a pay-per-use basis. However, storing sensitive data on un-trusted servers is a challenging issue for this model. To guarantee confidentiality and proper access control of outsourced sensitive data, classical encryption techniques are used. However, such access control schemes are not feasible in cloud computing because of their lack of flexibility, scalability, and fine-grained access control. Instead, Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) techniques are used in the cloud. This paper extensively surveys all ABE schemes and creates a comparison table for the key criteria for these schemes in cloud applications.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "102", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "113", "date_publication": "Feb. 2016", "inspec": "15823465", "date": "Feb. 2016", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 04 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "102 - 113", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Muhammad Yasir Shabir", "Asif Iqbal", "Zahid Mahmood", "Ataullah Ghafoor"], "keywords": ["authorisation", "cloud computing", "cryptography", "file servers", "ABE", "IT industry", "access control schemes", "attribute-based encryption techniques", "classical encryption techniques", "cloud applications", "cloud computing", "computing resources", "fine-grained access control", "outsourced sensitive data", "pay-per-use basis", "untrusted servers", "Access control", "Ciphers", "Cloud computing", "Encryption", "Public key", "access control", "cloud computing", "fine-grained access", "weighted attribute", ""], "arnumber": "7399287"}
