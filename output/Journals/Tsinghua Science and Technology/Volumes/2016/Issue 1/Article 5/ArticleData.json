Analysis of monitoring data delivers insights of the system's workload and usage pattern and ensures workloads are operating at optimum levels. The analysis process involves data query and extraction, data analysis, and result visualization. Since the volume of monitoring data is big, these operations require a scalable and reliable architecture to extract, aggregate, and analyze data in an arbitrary range of granularity. Ultimately, the results of analysis become the knowledge of the system and should be shared and communicated. This paper presents our cloud service architecture that explores a search cluster for data indexing and query. We develop REST APIs that the data can be accessed by different analysis modules. This architecture enables extensions to integrate with software frameworks of both batch processing (such as Hadoop) and stream processing (such as Spark) of big data. The analysis results are structured in Semantic Media Wiki pages in the context of the monitoring data source and the analysis process. This cloud architecture is empirically assessed to evaluate its responsiveness when processing a large set of data records under node failures.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "55", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "70", "date_publication": "Feb. 2016", "inspec": "15823468", "date": "Feb. 2016", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 04 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "55 - 70", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Samneet Singh", "Yan Liu"], "keywords": ["Big Data", "application program interfaces", "batch processing (computers)", "cloud computing", "data analysis", "indexing", "query processing", "semantic Web", "software architecture", "software reliability", "Big monitoring Data analysis process", "REST APIs", "batch processing", "cloud monitoring", "cloud service architecture", "data extraction", "data indexing", "data query", "data source monitoring", "result visualization", "search cluster", "semantic media Wiki pages", "software frameworks", "stream processing", "Cloud computing", "Computer architecture", "Electronic publishing", "Information services", "Monitoring", "Sparks", "REST API", "big data", "cloud computing", "semantic web", "software architecture", ""], "arnumber": "7399283"}
