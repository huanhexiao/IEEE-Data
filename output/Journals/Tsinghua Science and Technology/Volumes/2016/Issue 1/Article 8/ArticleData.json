To validate task migration, we propose a novel approach to the simulation of task migration in a pervasive cloud environment. Our approach is based on Colored Petri Net (CPN). In this research, we expanded the semantics of a CPN and created two task migration models with different task migration policies: one that took account of context information and one that did not. We evaluated the two models using CPN-based simulation and analyzed their task migration accessibility, integrity during the migration process, reliability, and the stability of the pervasive cloud system after task migration. The energy consumption and costs of the two models were also investigated. Our results suggest that CPN with context sensing task migration can minimize energy consumption while preserving good overall performance.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "89", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "101", "date_publication": "Feb. 2016", "inspec": "15823462", "date": "Feb. 2016", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 04 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "89 - 101", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Lianzhang Zhu", "Shouchao Tan", "Weishan Zhang", "Yong Wang", "Xiwei Xu"], "keywords": ["Petri nets", "cloud computing", "energy consumption", "mobile computing", "power aware computing", "CPN-based simulation", "colored Petri net", "context information", "energy consumption", "migration accessibility", "migration integrity", "migration process", "mobile clouds", "mobile devices", "pervasive cloud environment", "pervasive cloud system reliability", "pervasive cloud system stability", "pervasive cloud task migration validation", "task migration policies:", "Cloud computing", "Computational modeling", "Context", "Context modeling", "Image color analysis", "Mobile communication", "Virtual machining", "colored Petri net", "context information", "pervasive cloud", "task migration", "validation", ""], "arnumber": "7399286"}
