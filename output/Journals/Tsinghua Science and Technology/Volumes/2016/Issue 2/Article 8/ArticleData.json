Typical countermeasures to side-channel analysis involve adding noise and filtering the power consumption signal. In this paper, we integrate appropriate preprocessing methods with an improved attack strategy to generate a key recovery solution to the shortcomings of these countermeasures. Our proposed attack strategy improves the attack result by combining information leaked from two adjacent clock cycles. Using our laboratory-based power analysis system, we verified the proposed key recovery solution by performing a successful correlation power analysis on a Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES) hardware module in a real-life 32-bit CPU smart card. All 112 key bits of the 3DES were recovered with about 80 000 power traces.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "210", "volume": "21", "lastpage": "220", "date_publication": "April 2016", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2016", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 31 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "2", "pages": "210 - 220"}, "authors": ["Yanting Ren", "Liji Wu", "Hexin Li", "Xiangyu Li", "Xiangmin Zhang", "An Wang", "Hongyi Chen"], "keywords": ["Correlation", "Encryption", "Power demand", "Registers", "Smart cards", "Three-dimensional displays", "CPU smart cards", "Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES)", "key recovery", "power analysis", "side-channel analysis", ""], "arnumber": "7442503"}
