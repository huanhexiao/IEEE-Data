This paper presents the system architecture and functions for CIMS applicati on integrati on platform for manufacturing enterprises (MAOP). MACIP integrates a set of application cation software products and development tools as a compl ete system for CIIVS irrplementation. MACIP incl udes a communicati on system, a global information system, three domai n application suo-inteqration platforms, an internet interface and an operation rranagerrent and control system. The Client/Server Server structure, the object-oriented method and the agent technique were used in developing MACIP. Good system openness, scalability, and maintenance are ensured by conforming to international standards and by using advanced system design software and management tod MACIP can significantl the reduce the impl ementation complexity, tirre, and cost of CIMS.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "991", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "996", "date_publication": "June 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "991 - 996"}, "authors": ["Fan Yushun", "Wu Cheng"], "keywords": ["Computer integrated manufacturing", "Design automation", "IP networks", "Manufacturing", "Protocols", "Software", "Solid modeling", "CIMS", "application programming interface", "integration platform", "object-oriented", "system architecture", ""], "arnumber": "6078116"}
