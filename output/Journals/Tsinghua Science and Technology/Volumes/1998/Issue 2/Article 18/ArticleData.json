The calculated results for 54 pure liquids over a wide range of temperatures show that this equation is accurate and easy to use. The total relative deviation is less than 1. 1%. The equation developed for pure liquids was extended to mixtures using vdW-1 mixing rule. The deviations of predicted and correlated surface tension data for 21 binary systems were within 7.0% and 2.0%, respectively. With the adjustable parameters obtained from binary systems, the equation can accurately predict the surface tension of multicomponent systems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1029", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1034", "date_publication": "June 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "1029 - 1034"}, "authors": ["Li Chunxi", "Li Zhibao", "Li Yigui", "Lu Jiufang", "Song Hongyan"], "keywords": ["Equations", "Films", "Liquids", "Mathematical model", "Resource description framework", "Surface tension", "Kirkwood-Buff theory", "surface tension", "thermodynamic model", ""], "arnumber": "6078124"}
