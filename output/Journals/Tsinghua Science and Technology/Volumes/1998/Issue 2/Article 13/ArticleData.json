It relates directly to the quality of graphics generated by the algorithm, and to the speed and space efficiency of the algorithm. This paper proposes an algorithm for extracting silhouette curves that numerically determines the starting and ending silhouette points, then traces each starting point to obtain the whole silhouette curve. Silhouette loops are obtained by tracing silhouette points on isoparametric lines. This a gorithm is suitable for extracting silhouette curves at any given tolerarce without surface subdivision. The algor ithm is fast and requires minimal storage space.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1005", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1008", "date_publication": "June 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "1005 - 1008"}, "authors": ["Li Xuejun", "Sun Jiaguang", "Yang Changgui"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Approximation algorithms", "Linear approximation", "Piecewise linear approximation", "Surface reconstruction", "Surface topography", "NURBS surfaces", "hidden curve removal", "silhouette curves", "silhouette points", ""], "arnumber": "6078119"}
