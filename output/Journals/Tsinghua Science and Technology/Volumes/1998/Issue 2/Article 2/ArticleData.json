The study ill ustrates the influence of wind on the cooling tower performance and proposes a number of techniques for improving tower performance with a cross-wind", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "955", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "958", "date_publication": "June 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "955 - 958"}, "authors": ["Zhai Zhiqiang", "Zhu Keqin", "Fu Song"], "keywords": ["Aerodynamics", "Atmospheric modeling", "Cooling", "Heat transfer", "Heating", "Poles and towers", "Prototypes", "aerodynamcs", "cross wind", "model experiment", "natural-draft dry-cooling tower", ""], "arnumber": "6078108"}
