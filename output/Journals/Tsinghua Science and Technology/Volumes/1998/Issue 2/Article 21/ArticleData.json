The changes in microstructures and mechanical properties of composites with we particles were also investigated. The results show that increasing the deposition height can significantly enhance the bending strength and hardness of the alloy, and that the fish-bone like carbide ledeburite structure gradually diminishes as the WC particles content ircreases. It was discovered that the hardness of the composites ircreases due to the increase of point-like carbide ledeburite, accompanying the breaking of the fish-bone like and the net like carbides. However, the bending strength deteriorates due to excessive WC particles increasing the brittle interfacial phase.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1044", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1047", "date_publication": "June 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "1044 - 1047"}, "authors": ["Yuan Wei", "Hu Yue", "Zhang Liying", "Huang Zhuo", "Tian Haige", "Wu Chengyi"], "keywords": ["Atomic layer deposition", "Cooling", "Materials", "Microstructure", "Optical wavelength conversion", "Steel", "WC particles", "high speed steel", "particle composite", "spray forming", "ultrasonic atomization", ""], "arnumber": "6078127"}
