A 8\u2033 (21.59 cm) crown type POC-R bit is used as an example. The compl ex configuration of the POC bit surface is resd ved nurrerically usi ng body-fitting coordi nates and the cutters are simpli field as drag elements in the momentum equations and as heat source in the energy equation. The finite volurre rrethod is used to discretize the momentum and energy equations for the non-Newtonian flow. The nurrerical results effectively predict the flow structure and temperature field which can be used to design and optimize the POC bit.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "981", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "985", "date_publication": "June 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "981 - 985"}, "authors": ["Cui Guixiang", "Xu Weiran", "Zhang Zhaoshun"], "keywords": ["Diamond-like carbon", "Equations", "Fluid flow", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Predictive models", "Temperature distribution", "PDC (Polycrystalline Diamond Compact) bit", "non-Newtonian fluid flow", "numerical simulation", ""], "arnumber": "6078114"}
