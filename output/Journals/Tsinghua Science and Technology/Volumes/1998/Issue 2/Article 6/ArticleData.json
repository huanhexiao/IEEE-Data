Detailed in-plane and out-of-plane whole-field displacerrent data of the top and bottom ends of the gull wing leads and their distri butions along the edge of PQFP are provi ded. The maximum deforrrations of the gull wing leads occur at the four corners of the PQFP. The experirrental results are used as displacerrent boundary condition in a linear-el asti c analysis of the therrral stresses of the corner lead and its solder joint using a 3-D finite element method (FEM). The highest stresses occur in the area connecti ng the I ead and the solder joint. The results should be useful in the evaluati on of therrral fatigue damage of surface mount assembl ies.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "971", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "977", "date_publication": "June 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "971 - 977"}, "authors": ["Dai Fulong", "Shi Ling", "Wen Xiumei"], "keywords": ["Lead", "Optical interferometry", "Soldering", "Stress", "Temperature measurement", "Thermal stresses", "holographic interferometry", "moire interferometry", "plastic-quad-flat-pack (PQFP)", "printed circuit boards (PCB)", "thermal deforrration", ""], "arnumber": "6078112"}
