McMesh uses the mesh weight window method as the major variance reduction technique with other methods such as exponential transforms and correlated sampling included as options. There was good agreement between the calculated results from McMesh and from MCNP, a general Monte Carlo program, but McMesh was more efficient and more convenient.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1048", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1052", "date_publication": "June 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "1048 - 1052"}, "authors": ["Wang Rushan", "Jiang Hongyu"], "keywords": ["Coal", "Computational efficiency", "Detectors", "Monte Carlo methods", "Neutrons", "Slurries", "Solids", "Monte Carlo method", "coal slurry", "correlated sampling", "variance reduction technique", "weight window", ""], "arnumber": "6078128"}
