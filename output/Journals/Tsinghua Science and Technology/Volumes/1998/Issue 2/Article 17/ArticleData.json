The power source includes several isolated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) inverter power units. The output current of every individual power unit is regulated by an identical single chip microcomputer to enable the whole power source system to work over a wide range of continuous output current with good dynamic properties. This inverter type power source satisfies robotic welding requirements.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1026", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1028", "date_publication": "June 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "1026 - 1028"}, "authors": ["Du Dong", "Han Zandong", "Xiao Ping", "Zhang Qian", "Zhang Renhao"], "keywords": ["Assembly", "Control systems", "Insulated gate bipolar transistors", "Inverters", "Microcomputers", "Robots", "Welding", "arc welding robot", "inverter power source", "unit assembly", ""], "arnumber": "6078123"}
