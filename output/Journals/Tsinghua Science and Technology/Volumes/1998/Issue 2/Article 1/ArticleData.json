The heart of the model is a three-dimensional flow and heat transfer model capable of calculating the glass flow and temperature distribution in the melt. The glass quality is predicted by using additional sub-models for flow tracking, melting kinetics, homogenizing, refining, and refractory corrosion. A sample result is presented to ill ustrate the analysis of the glass melting process.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "949", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "954", "date_publication": "June 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "949 - 954"}, "authors": ["Qi Jianwei", "Guo Zengyuan"], "keywords": ["Atmospheric modeling", "Glass", "Heat transfer", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Refining", "Trajectory", "glass melting process", "homogenizing", "mathematical model", "three-dimensional", ""], "arnumber": "6078107"}
