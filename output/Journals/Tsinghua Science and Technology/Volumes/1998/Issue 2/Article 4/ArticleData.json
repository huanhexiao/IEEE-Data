PIV is a very important method for studying turbulence and coherent vortical structures. This paper presents the results of an experimental investigation of a free jet and a plane mixing layer by using the PIV technique. Two different optical arrangements for the PIV measurements are compared.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "963", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "965", "date_publication": "June 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "963 - 965"}, "authors": ["Xu Hongqing", "Wu Jia"], "keywords": ["Cameras", "Correlation", "Fluids", "Laser beams", "Measurement by laser beam", "Particle beams", "Temperature measurement", "free jet", "mixing layer", "particle image velocimetry (PIV)", ""], "arnumber": "6078110"}
