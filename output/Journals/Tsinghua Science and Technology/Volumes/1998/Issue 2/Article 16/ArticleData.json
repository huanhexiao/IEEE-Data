The tapes were processed to their final thickness by repeated rolling and pressing and by a combination rolling and pressing with intermediate heat treatment. The different processing techniques greatly affected the critical current density Jc of the tapes because the homogeneity of the ceramic core and the propensity for crack formation within the tapes mainly depended on the deformation process.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1022", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1025", "date_publication": "June 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "1022 - 1025"}, "authors": ["Ma Yanwei", "Wang Zutang"], "keywords": ["Bismuth", "Critical current density", "Heat treatment", "Powders", "Pressing", "Superconducting films", "Wires", "critical current density", "processing", "superconducting tapes", ""], "arnumber": "6078122"}
