In this paper the degenerate conditions of triangular Bezier surface patches are derived. The degenerate conditions and constrained optimization methods are used to develop a degree reduction method for triangular Bezier surface patches. The error in the degree reduction of a triangular Bezier surface is also shown to depend on some geometric invariants which decrease exponentially in the subdivision process. Therefore, the degree reduction method can be combined with a subdivision algorithm to generate lower degree approximations which are wi thin some preset error tolerance.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1001", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1004", "date_publication": "June 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "1001 - 1004"}, "authors": ["Hu Shimin", "Zuo Zheng", "Sun Jiaguang"], "keywords": ["Approximation algorithms", "Chebyshev approximation", "Computers", "Least squares approximation", "Piecewise linear approximation", "Surface treatment", "CAGD", "constrained optimization method", "degenerate condition", "degree reduction", "triangular Bezier surface", ""], "arnumber": "6078118"}
