Transient full-field fringe patterns were acquired during the heating process. Transient temperature of the specimen was simultaneously recorded by a temperature measurement system. The experimental results show that dynamic moire fringe patterns can be measured during high heating rate conditions using high speed photography.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "966", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "970", "date_publication": "June 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "966 - 970"}, "authors": ["Dai Fulong", "Wang Guotao", "Xie Huimin", "Zhang Guangjun"], "keywords": ["Gratings", "Optical interferometry", "Resistance heating", "Strain", "Temperature measurement", "dynamic deformation", "grating for high temperature", "moire interferometry", "shock heating", "high", "speed photography", ""], "arnumber": "6078111"}
