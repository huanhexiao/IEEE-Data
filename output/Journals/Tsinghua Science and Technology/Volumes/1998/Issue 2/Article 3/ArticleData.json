An isothermal model test and a combustion test give encouraging results. The temperature and gas composition in the combustion experiments were measured using thermocouples and a COSA-6000-CD portable stack analyzer. The combustion temperature distribution was uniform. The geometry was compared further to provide stronger recirculation in the spouting zone and a strong swirling effect in the cyclone zone. These results indicate that the improved geometrical configuration of the combustor favors to the stabilization of the coal flame and intensified coal combustion, and it provides a basis for practical application of this technique.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "959", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "962", "date_publication": "June 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "959 - 962"}, "authors": ["Wang Xilin", "Ma Zhanhua", "Wang Dexin", "Zhou Lixing"], "keywords": ["Coal", "Combustion", "Cyclones", "Ignition", "Isothermal processes", "Temperature distribution", "Temperature measurement", "coal combusion", "combustor", "cyclone", ""], "arnumber": "6078109"}
