This investigation shows that the phosphor us concentration in the initial culture medium influences both the residual cell mass and the PHB production. A kinetic model is proposed for the production of PHB in a fed-batch culture of Alcaligenes Eutrophus. The kinetic model is compared with the experimental results and appears to provide an excellent description of the overall fermentation process. A phosphate mass concentration of 4.5 g/L produced the highest level of dry cell mass concentration (266 g/L), PHB mass concentration (214 g/L), PHB mass content (80.4%) and PHB productivity (3.51 g/L\u00b7 h) so far obtained.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1040", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1043", "date_publication": "June 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "1040 - 1043"}, "authors": ["Li Honqi", "Ryu Hee Wook", "Chang Yang Keun", "Chang Ho Nam", "Shen Zhongyao"], "keywords": ["Biological system modeling", "Data models", "Kinetic theory", "Mathematical model", "Predictive models", "Sugar", "Alcaligenes Eutrophus", "kinetics", "phosphorus Iimitati on", "poly (3-hydroxybutyrate)", ""], "arnumber": "6078126"}
