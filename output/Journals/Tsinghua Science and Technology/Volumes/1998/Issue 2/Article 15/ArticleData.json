The CCMVS structure and the significance of reliability estimation are described first. Then the reliability is analyzed with fault tree analysis (FTA) and quantitatively evaluated using symbolic hierarchical automated reliability and performance evaluator (SHARPE). Finally, the weak point of the CCMVS is identified and measures to improve its reliability are proposed on the basis of the reliabilitylity data such as reliability and importance. Experiments have proved that the reliability of CCMVS is obviously improved using reliability techniques.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1016", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1021", "date_publication": "June 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "1016 - 1021"}, "authors": ["Tong Yanling", "Tang Jingxin"], "keywords": ["Circuit faults", "Computers", "Connectors", "Couplers", "Fault trees", "Hardware", "Reliability", "computer", "reliability", "voting system", ""], "arnumber": "6078121"}
