The degenerate conditi on of Bezier curves and the constrai ned optimization rrethod are used to develop a new degree reduction method for Bezi er curves. An error anal ysis of the degree reduction is also given. The degree reduction scheme is corrbined with a subdivision algorithm to generate lower degree approximations which are within some preset error tolerance of the prescri bed Bezier curve. Geometri c continuity between adjacent curve segments is also consi dered in the subdivision! degree reduction process.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "997", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1000", "date_publication": "June 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "997 - 1000"}, "authors": ["Hu Shimin", "Sun Jiaguang", "Jin Tongguang", "Wang Guozhao"], "keywords": ["Approximation algorithms", "Chebyshev approximation", "Design automation", "Least squares approximation", "Linear approximation", "Piecewise linear approximation", "Bezier curve", "constrained optimization", "degenerate condition", "degree reduction", "geometric continuity", ""], "arnumber": "6078117"}
