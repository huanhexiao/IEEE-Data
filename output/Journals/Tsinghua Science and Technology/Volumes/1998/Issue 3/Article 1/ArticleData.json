Therefore, Tsou suggested that enzyme active sites may display more conformational flexibility than the enzyme rrolecul es as a whole. In the present investigation, the conforrrational changes of Penaeus penicillatus acid phosphatase during denaturati on in urea solutions were studied by following changes in the intrinsic fluorescerce, ultraviolet differerce absorption, and circular dichroism spectra. Inactivation of the enzyme in urea solutions was compared with unfolding of the enzyme molecule. The results show that the extent of unfolding in guanidine solutions measured by several different methods closely coincides with each other and that slightly lower concentrations of guanidine are required to bring about inactivation than are required to produce significant conforrrational changes of the enzyme molecule. At the same corcentrati ons, the inactivation rate constants are markedly faster than the rate constants for unfolding of the enzyme. The above results suggest that the active sites of this enzyme display more conforrrational flexibility than the enzyme molecule as a whole.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1053", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1058", "date_publication": "Sept. 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1053 - 1058"}, "authors": ["Chen Suli", "Chen Qingxi", "Yang Peizhen", "Lin Dating", "Li Sen", "Zhou Haimeng"], "keywords": ["Absorption", "Fluorescence", "Kinetic theory", "Proteins", "Substrates", "Wavelength measurement", "acid Phosphatase", "conformationalonal change", "inactivation", "urea solution", ""], "arnumber": "6077231"}
