ApoH prefers to interact with negatively charged phospholipids in vivo, and it is believed that such interaction is closely related to the physiological functions of ApoH and to the initialization and development of some autoimmune diseases. However, the nature of the interaction between ApoH and phosphdi pids is not well understood. Monolayers at an air/water interface were used to study the characteristics of the interaction between ApoH and a phospholi pid merrbrane. The resul ts show that ApoH is an amphipathic protein with surface activity which can insert into lipid mondayers through hydrophobic force. The critical insertion pressure of ApoH interacting with DPPS(dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl serine) and DPPC(dipalmtoyl phosphatidyl choline) monolayers is 33.5 mN/m and 27.7 mN/m, respectively.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1091", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1094", "date_publication": "Sept. 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1091 - 1094"}, "authors": ["Wang Shaoxiong", "Cai Guoping", "Sui Senfang"], "keywords": ["Biomembranes", "Electrostatics", "Force", "Humans", "Lipidomics", "Manganese", "Proteins", "apoipoprotein H (ApoH)", "critical insertion pressure", "lipid mondayers", ""], "arnumber": "6077240"}
