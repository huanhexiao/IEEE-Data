In this article pSV-\u03b2-Gal plasmid was induced into osteoblast cells successfully by laser microbeam method and ul trasound method, and \u03b2-Gal gene was highly expressed. The optimal conditions for the ultrasound and laser microbeam methods of gene transfer were obtained.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1084", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1086", "date_publication": "Sept. 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1084 - 1086"}, "authors": ["Tang Qing", "Chen Gang", "Shen Ziwei", "Zhang Zhicheng", "Cai Guoping", "Zhao Nanming"], "keywords": ["Biomembranes", "Biotechnology", "Cells (biology)", "Chemical lasers", "Fluorescence", "Laser theory", "Ultrasonic imaging", "gene transfer", "laser microbeam method", "osteoblast cells", "pSV-&#x03B2", "-Gal plasmid", "ultrasound method", ""], "arnumber": "6077238"}
