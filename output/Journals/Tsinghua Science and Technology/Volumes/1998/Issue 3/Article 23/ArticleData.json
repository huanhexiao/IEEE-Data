Basis ftnction-like nets are employed to approximate the plant nonli nearilties, and the bound on the NN reconstruction error is assurred to be unknown. The proposed NN-based adaptive control approach integrates an NN approach with an adaptive implementation of discrete variable structure control with a simple estimation law to estimate the upper bound on the NN reconstruction error and an additional control input to be updated as a function of the estimate. Lyapunov stability theory is used to prove the uni form ultimate boundedness of the tracking error.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1149", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1154", "date_publication": "Sept. 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1149 - 1154"}, "authors": ["Sun Fuchun", "Lu Wenjuan", "Dai Min"], "keywords": ["Artificial neural networks", "Control systems", "Manipulator dynamics", "Measurement", "Vectors", "basis function-like nets", "discrete time variable structure", "robot adaptive control", "stability", ""], "arnumber": "6077253"}
