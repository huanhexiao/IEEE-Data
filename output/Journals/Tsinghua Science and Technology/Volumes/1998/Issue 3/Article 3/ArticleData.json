Monomers with medium side chain length in the polymers produced by two bacterial strains No. 0806 and No. 1317 grown on glucose were observed using GC (gas chromatography), R (infrared spectroscopy), and GC-MS (gas chromatographymass spectroscopy) analysis. The structures of the PHAs reported in this study are different from the common polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) often stored by bacteria.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1063", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1069", "date_publication": "Sept. 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1063 - 1069"}, "authors": ["Hong Kui", "Chen Guoqiang", "Tian Weidong", "Huang Weiyi", "Fan Qingsheng"], "keywords": ["Carbon", "Dairy products", "Media", "Microorganisms", "Plastics", "Strain", "Sugar", "biopolymer", "gas chromatography", "polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs)", ""], "arnumber": "6077233"}
