Also, a new microscope, ell ipsometric microscope (EMM), was designed and constructed for studying film surfaces. Using the self-made EMM specific interaction of rabbit C-reactive protein (rCRP) with DS8 PC containing monolayers was studied.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1100", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1104", "date_publication": "Sept. 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1100 - 1104"}, "authors": ["Tong Jing", "Zhou Yue", "Mao Jia", "Sui Senfang"], "keywords": ["Biomembranes", "Decision support systems", "Lipidomics", "Proteins", "Rabbits", "Silicon compounds", "Solids", "C-reactive protein", "ellipsometry", "lipid monolayer", ""], "arnumber": "6077242"}
