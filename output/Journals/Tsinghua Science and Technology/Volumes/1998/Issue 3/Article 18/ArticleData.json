The hydrophili cities of the phospholipid surfaces were compared using contact angle rreasurerrents. It is shown that the different phosphdipids affect the EC behavior differently during di fferent periods of the cell growth. Within the cell attachment period, the EC density showed that the positively charged phospholipid PL can promote the EC attachment while the neutral PC can inhibit the attachment to sorre extent. No obvious correlation between the surface hydrophi licity and the EC attachment could be found. It is suggested that the EC attachment is dependent on the electrical charge of the phospholipid surfaces rather than the hydrophilicities of the surfaces. Within the cell growth peri od, the EC density and morphdogy demonstrated that the PS and PE surfaces can promote EC proliferation and growth but the PC and PA surfaces can inhibit the proliferation and growth. It is suggested that the EC proliferati on and growth should be dependent on the phospholipid surface hydrophilicities rather thanthe electrical charges of the surfaces. A moderately hydrophil ic phospholipid surface is beneficial to EC proliferati on and growth while highly hydrophilic or slightly hydrophi lic phospholipid surfaces can not promote or even inhibit EC proliferati on and growth.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1125", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1128", "date_publication": "Sept. 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1125 - 1128"}, "authors": ["Cui Xinyan", "Gong Yandao", "Zhang Xiufang", "Zhao Nanming"], "keywords": ["Adhesives", "Blood", "Morphology", "Plastics", "Proteins", "Surface morphology", "attachment", "electricity", "growth", "hydrophilicity", "phospholi pid", "proliferation", "vein endothelial cell", ""], "arnumber": "6077248"}
