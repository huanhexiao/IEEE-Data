The results showed that a large nurrber of ribosomes were adsorbed on the lipid merrbrane surfaces containing positiviely charged SA (octadecylamine), while few ribosomes were observed on surfaces of neutral or negatively charged lipid monolayers. The monolayers. The interaction of ribosome with positively charged monolayers was affected by the composition and ratio of the membrane lipids, and by the ionic strength and pH value of the subphase buffer. The results suggest that ribosome should be adsorbed on the membrane surface through electrostatic force.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1095", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1099", "date_publication": "Sept. 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1095 - 1099"}, "authors": ["Wang Shaoxiong", "Sui Senfang"], "keywords": ["Biomembranes", "Electrostatics", "Lipidomics", "Liver", "Proteins", "80S rat liver ribosorre", "lipid-protein interaction", "maximum surface density", ""], "arnumber": "6077241"}
