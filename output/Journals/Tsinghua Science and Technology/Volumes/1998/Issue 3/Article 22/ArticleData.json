The distinguishing features of the CAD package are that it allows a wide range of design options and parameter variations for the new type of machines, calculations of optimization for maximum efficiency and higher power density, and various performance. The package as described in the main text permits the integration of the machine design with an electronic controller, along with the simulation of the whole system. Through the optimal design, characteristic calculations, and system simulations, the CAD package offers a superior design for the SR-PM machines, and presents a feasibility frontier outl ined by the design.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1143", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1148", "date_publication": "Sept. 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1143 - 1148"}, "authors": ["Zhao Zhengming", "Ei-Antably Ahmed"], "keywords": ["Design automation", "Magnetic flux", "Rotors", "Saturation magnetization", "Solid modeling", "Stators", "Torque", "computer-aided design", "perrmnent magnet machine", "synchronous reluctance machine", ""], "arnumber": "6077252"}
