The patch-clamp technique was used to study the behavior of melittin on the membranes of myoballs and neurons which were dissociated from a l-d-old Xenopus embryo. Melittin was observed to make \u201cresistance channels\u201d that are selective to sodium. When melittin acted on the merrbranes of muscle cells, intracurrents appeared and then disappeared. At neuromuscular junctions (NMJ), melittin was added to the area adjacent to the neurons, increased the frequency of micro-end plate currents (MEPCs) by 40%, and increased the arrplitude of MEPCs by 15%.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1087", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1090", "date_publication": "Sept. 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1087 - 1090"}, "authors": ["Feng Gang", "Jiang Yue", "Xie Zuoping", "Kang Jiefang", "Li Jishuo"], "keywords": ["Biomembranes", "Clamps", "Electric fields", "Electric potential", "Fitting", "Junctions", "Neurons", "channel", "melittin", "patch-clamp", ""], "arnumber": "6077239"}
