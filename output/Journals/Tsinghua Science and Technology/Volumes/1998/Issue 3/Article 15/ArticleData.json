Utrasound, magnetic resonance image (MRI) and corrputer-aided topography (CAT) allow visualization of changes due to hemorrhages. However, these methods do not detect the biochemical effects due to hypoxia and ischemia. This paper presents in vivo observations of brain metabolism attested by hypoxide and ischemia made using magnetic resonance spectroscopy(MRS), a noninvasive and nondestructive method which can identify the chemical compounds and monitor thei r changes during the biochemical reaction process for in vivo dynamic observation.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1112", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1114", "date_publication": "Sept. 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1112 - 1114"}, "authors": ["Luo Xuechun", "Zhao Nanming", "Zhang Riqing", "Li Keling", "Jiang Yufeng", "Huang Qifu"], "keywords": ["Biochemistry", "Biomedical monitoring", "Coils", "In vivo", "Magnetic resonance", "Mice", "Surface treatment", "NMR", "brain metabolism", "surface coil", ""], "arnumber": "6077245"}
