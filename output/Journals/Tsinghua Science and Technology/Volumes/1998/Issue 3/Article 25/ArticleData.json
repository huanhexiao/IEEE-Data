For well over a decade, Natures staff in the Asia-Pacific region have been keeping in close touch with scientists and policy makers in China, while both my predecessor, John Maddox, and I have placed China high on our list of priorities. I am convinced that the Chineseg overnment will continue to appreciate the importance of science to the countrys future development in terms of the countrys intellectual standing, growing economy and the conditions of its people. I will be delighted if Nature can help sustain that sense of national priorities by helping to enhance the international and domestic profile of Chinese science.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1166", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1166", "date_publication": "Sept. 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1166"}, "authors": ["Philip Campbell"], "keywords": ["Atmospheric measurements", "Color", "Editorials", "Government", "Guidelines", "Particle measurements", "Publishing", ""], "arnumber": "6077255"}
