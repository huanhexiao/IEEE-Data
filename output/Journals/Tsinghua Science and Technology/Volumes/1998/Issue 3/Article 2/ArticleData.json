The present paper compares the inactivation and unfdding of green crab (Scylla serrata) alkaline phosphate during thermal denaturation. The results show that inactivation takes place before noticeable conformational changes. This is in general accord with the suggestion previously made by Tsou, indicati ng that the active site of multi-metal enzymes is situated in a regi on more flexible than the molecules as a whole.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1059", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1062", "date_publication": "Sept. 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1059 - 1062"}, "authors": ["Chen Qingxi", "Zhao Hong", "Zhang Wei", "Yang Huang Hao", "Zhuang Zonglai", "Zhang Tong", "Zhou Haimeng"], "keywords": ["Biochemistry", "Fluorescence", "Ions", "Kinetic theory", "Substrates", "Temperature measurement", "Zinc", "alkaline phosphatase", "green crab", "inactivation", "thermal denaturation", "unfolding", ""], "arnumber": "6077232"}
