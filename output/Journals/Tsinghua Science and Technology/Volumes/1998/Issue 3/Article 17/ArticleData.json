The mechanism by which phospholipids function in calcification was studied by lipid removal and lipid addition to investigate the different effects of neutral phosphatidylcholine (PC), negatively charged phosphatidylserine (PS), positively charged phosphatidylethenolanine-lysire (PL) and cationic lipid stearylamine (SA) on the calcification. Calcification of bovine pericardium (BP) in a simulated serum was used as a model. The addition of the three phospholipids promoted the calcification of pericardium untreated wi th glutaraldehyde (GA). However, none of the lipids prorroted calcification of the GA treated pericardium. In addition, PL and SA obviously inhibited calcification on GA treated pericardium. The results also showed that alkaline phosphatase (ALP) directly promoted the calcification of pericardium.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1121", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1124", "date_publication": "Sept. 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1121 - 1124"}, "authors": ["Cui Xinyan", "Gong Yandao", "Zhang Xiufang", "Zhao Nanming"], "keywords": ["Calcium", "Heart", "Implants", "In vitro", "Lipidomics", "Mineralization", "Valves", "alkaline phosphatase (ALP)", "bovine pericardium (BP)", "calcification", "phospholipid", ""], "arnumber": "6077247"}
