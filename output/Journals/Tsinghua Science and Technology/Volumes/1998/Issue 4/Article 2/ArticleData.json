The quantum tunneling rates for these processes are evaluated for two examples of macroscopic quantum tunneling and one example of macroscopic quantum coherence. The calculations are perforrred by using the two-sublattice model and the instanton method in the spin-coherent-state path integral. Quantum interference or the spin-parity effect is also discussed for each case.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1179", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1183", "date_publication": "Dec. 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "1179 - 1183"}, "authors": ["L\u00fc Rong", "Zhu Jialin", "Chen Xi", "Chang Lee"], "keywords": ["Coherence", "Interference", "Magnetic anisotropy", "Magnetic fields", "Magnetization", "Tunneling", "Vectors", "N&#x00E9", "el vector", "antiferromagnetic particles", "macroscopic quantum tunneling and coherence", "quantum interfererce effect", "topological term", ""], "arnumber": "6077132"}
