More stringent nuclear safety standards have to be established for future nuclear power plants. The philosophy of a catastrophe-free nuclear technology is presented in this paper. The issue of afterheat removal of high temperature gas cooled reactors is handled. It is a striking inherent safety feature of the modular high temperature gas cooled reactor design that the afterheat removal takes place without any active core cooling systems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1167", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1178", "date_publication": "Dec. 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "1167 - 1178"}, "authors": ["K.
