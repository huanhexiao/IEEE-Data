The extensive knowledge acquired in the last decade in high temperature superconducting science and materials may usher in a new era of material engineering, which I would like to call mesomaterial engineering for the fabrication of perovskite and related oxide superlattices, a new class of materials for science and technology. Therefore, I shall also present the rationale behind this effort and the promises of the new materials, together with a list of several preliminary successful examples.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "914", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "935", "date_publication": "March 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "914 - 935"}, "authors": ["Ching-Wu Chu"], "keywords": ["Bismuth compounds", "Superconducting transition temperature", "Yttrium barium copper oxide", "high temperature superconductivity", "mesomaterial engineering", "oxide", ""], "arnumber": "6078100"}
