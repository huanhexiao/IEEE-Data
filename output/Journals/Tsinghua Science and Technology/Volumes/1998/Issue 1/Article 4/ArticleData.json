It is emphasized that the simple analytic representations of the lattice modes calculated with the dipole oscillator model have introduced the double boundary condition that both the electrostatic potential and optical displacement vanish at the interfaces and have found wide acceptance. They have been referred to as the Huang-Zhu model. It is pointed out that its improved simulation version is essentially the dielectric continuum model taking account of phonon dispersion and subject to the double boundary condition.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "900", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "913", "date_publication": "March 1998", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1998", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "900 - 913"}, "authors": ["Kun Huang", "Bang-fen Zhu"], "keywords": ["Dielectrics", "Lattices", "Mathematical model", "Optical superlattices", "Oscillators", "Vibrations", "electron-phonon Frohlich interaction", "polar phonon modes", "semiconductor superlattices", ""], "arnumber": "6078099"}
