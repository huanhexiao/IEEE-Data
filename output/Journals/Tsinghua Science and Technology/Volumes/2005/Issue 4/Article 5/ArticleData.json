TCS can be internalized by the host cells and then attacks the ribosomes resulting in cell death. However, the manner for endocytic uptake of TCS is not well understood. The present work investigates the endocytosis pathway of TCS in human choriocarcinoma cells. The different endocytic mechanisms are interfered by potassium depletion, cholesterol-extraction/addition, or treatments of various drugs. The experiments detect their effects on the TCS-uptake. The results show that a large portion of the TCS can be internalized by clathrin-dependent, as well as by clathrin-independent but cholesterol-dependent endocytosis in human choriocarcinoma cells.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "430", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "434", "date_publication": "Aug. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "430 - 434"}, "authors": ["Fan Zhang", "Senfang Sui"], "keywords": ["Biomembranes", "Drugs", "Fluorescence", "Humans", "Plasmas", "Proteins", "cholesterol-dependent endocytosis", "clathrin-dependent endocytosis", "trichosanthin", ""], "arnumber": "6075804"}
