The spatial distribution characteristics of the vegetation in Nenjiang region of northeastern China were evaluated using a variance power-law model. The data fits the model well with estimates given for the levels of heterogeneity for not only single species but also the community as a whole. The linear regression indicates that the species in the community exhibit a consistently organized spatial pattern, as is often discovered in field surveys but rarely seen in artificial systems. The species deviations from the regression line, which exhibit a leptokurtic distribution, may reflect the variability of the community. Thus, the model provides a general tool for management and regulation of ecosystems, especially where there is human disturbances.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "469", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "477", "date_publication": "Aug. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "469 - 477"}, "authors": ["Zhiyuan Song", "Darning Huang", "Masae Shiyomi", "Yusheng Wang", "Shiqeo Takahashi", "Hori Yoshimichi", "Yasuo Yamamuru", "Jun Chen"], "keywords": ["Biological system modeling", "Communities", "Data models", "Educational institutions", "Mathematical model", "Vegetation", "Vegetation mapping", "community variability", "leptokurtic distribution", "power-law model", "resilience", "spatial heterogeneity", ""], "arnumber": "6075811"}
