A hollow chitosan tube was prepared using an industrial warp knitting process with chitosan yarns. Then, an appropriate diameter mandrel was inserted into the pre-fabricated tube. The tube and the mandrel were dipped into the chitosan solution together, taken out, and freeze-dried. After being neutralized in alkaline solution and dried at room temperature, the mandrel was removed to create the chitosan tubular scaffold. Scanning electron micrographs show that the resulting tubes have a biphasic wall structure, with a fibrous inner layer and a semipermeable outer layer. The swelling properties and the mechanical strength before and after in vitro degradation were investigated. The biocompatibility of the scaffolds was also investigated by co-culturing neuroblastoma cells (N2A, mouse) with the scaffolds. The results suggest that these chitosan tubular scaffolds are useful for the regeneration of tissues requiring a tubular scaffold.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "449", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "453", "date_publication": "Aug. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "449 - 453"}, "authors": ["Aijun Wang", "Qiang Ao", "Wenling Cao", "Chang Zhao", "Yandao Gong", "Nanming Zhao", "Xiufang Zhang"], "keywords": ["Blood vessels", "Degradation", "Electron tubes", "In vitro", "Tissue engineering", "Yarn", "chitosan", "knitting", "nerve conduit", "tissue engineering", ""], "arnumber": "6075808"}
