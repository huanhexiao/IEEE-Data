The measurements showed that AK unfolded through two equilibrium intermediates: the molten globule state and the partly folded state. Both intermediates have no enzyme activity. The molten globule state exists at 0.4\u20130.8 mol/L GdmCI, perhaps after the N-terminal domain has unfolded but the C-terminal domain is still intact. The partly folded state occurs at 1.1\u20131.5 mol/L GdmCI with a hydrodynamic volume no more than 1.6-fold larger than the native state and a pronounced far UV-CD signal. Its ANS fluorescence intensity is about 50% of the molten globule state. This partly folded state shares similarities with the \u201cburst\u201d kinetic intermediate of protein folding.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "461", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "468", "date_publication": "Aug. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "461 - 468"}, "authors": ["Xiaogang Guo", "Liping Xie", "Jicheng Pan", "Rongqing Zhang"], "keywords": ["Deconvolution", "Diamond-like carbon", "Fluorescence", "Hydrodynamics", "Monitoring", "Proteins", "arginine kinase", "equilibrium intermediate", "molten globule state", "partly folded state", ""], "arnumber": "6075810"}
