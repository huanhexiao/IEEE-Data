The protective effect was quantitatively evaluated by measuring the lactate dehydrogenase release rate. Most of the compounds reduce the lactate dehydrogenase release rate, including emodin, chrysophanol-8-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside, 6-hydroxymusizin-8-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside, gnetin C, torachrysone-8-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside, and maesopsin, and all possess potent neuron protective activity. Chrysophanol and aloe-emodin exhibit neuron protection only at low concentrations. Emodin-8-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside protects the neuron cells at high concentration. Aloe-emodin-8-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside is inactive.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "426", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "429", "date_publication": "Aug. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "426 - 429"}, "authors": ["Lan Xiang", "Fan Lei", "Dongming Xing", "Wei Wang", "Junhua Zheng"], "keywords": ["Calcium", "Chemicals", "Compounds", "Educational institutions", "In vitro", "Mice", "Neurons", "R. subtenceoletum", "Rheum nanum", "chemical constituents", "neuron protective activity", ""], "arnumber": "6075803"}
