A polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based strategy and cDNA library screening were used to clone an exo-\u03b2-qlucanase gene (LP-Exol) from Lilium longiflorum pollen tubes. The LP-Exol sequence showed a high level of homology to that of reported plant exo-\u03b2-qlucan hydrolases. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that there was close relationship between LP-Exol and other exo-glucan hydrolases in Poacea plants. Northern analysis indicated that LP-Exol transcripts stored in pollen grains at low levels; LP-Exol transcription level enhanced at 2 h after the onset of pollen incubation and remained relatively high during pollen tube elongation. Moreover, the expression of LP-Exol was undetectable in petals, filaments, stigmas, styles, ovaries, leaves, and stems. These results suggest that LP-Exol gene is a late pollen gene, specifically contributing to the regulation of lily pollen germination and pollen tube growth.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "421", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "425", "date_publication": "Aug. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "421 - 425"}, "authors": ["Xizhen Liu", "Jian Huang", "Rongfu Gao", "Yiqin Li"], "keywords": ["Cloning", "Educational institutions", "Electron tubes", "Libraries", "Proteins", "RNA", "exo-&#x03B2", "-glucanase", "lily (Lilium longiflorum)", "pollen tube growth", ""], "arnumber": "6075802"}
