The concentrations of dissolved redox-relevant species suggested that iron-reduction/sulfate-reduction and denitrification were major redox processes for GW-H and GW-S. The dominant microbial populations were determined using restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses of 16S rRNA gene clone libraries. These microbes were then further studied by sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. The results indicate an obvious variation of the dominant populations between the two samples. The coexistence of sequences related to denitrifiers, sulfur-reducers, and methanotrophic bacteria was found in the GW-S sample, and a sequence associated with a sulfate-reducer was also found in the GW-H sample using molecular analyses. These results suggest that the molecular approach may be an important supplement to other approaches in characterizing the redox processes in polluted aquifers.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "517", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "522", "date_publication": "Aug. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "517 - 522"}, "authors": ["Yangjie Tian", "Hong Yang", "Daotang Li", "Xiujuan Wu"], "keywords": ["Cloning", "Iron", "Libraries", "Microorganisms", "Phylogeny", "Temperature measurement", "Water pollution", "16S rRNA", "clone library", "landfill", "microbial diversity", "saline groundwater", ""], "arnumber": "6076282"}
