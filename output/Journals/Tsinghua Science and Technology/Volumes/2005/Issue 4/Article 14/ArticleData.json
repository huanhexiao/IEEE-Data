The intracellular domain APP (AID) was suggested to cause neurotoxicity in the nucleus. To investigate the functions AID, yeast two-hybrid screening was performed to identify the proteins which interact with AID. The human brain cDNA library was screened using pGBKT7-AID as a bait, and several positive clones were identified. One of them encodes a part of the human stathmin-like 2 protein (STMN2). The interaction between STMN2 and APP implies that STMN2 may have an important function in APP-mediated AD formation.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "484", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "488", "date_publication": "Aug. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "484 - 488"}, "authors": ["Zhidong Li", "Weiwei Wang", "Fangfang Zhou", "Xia Gao", "Gaonong Peng", "Huaxi Xu", "Ye-Guang Chen"], "keywords": ["Alzheimer's disease", "Amino acids", "Cloning", "DNA", "Humans", "Libraries", "Proteins", "Alzheimer's disease (AD)", "amyloid precursor protein (APP)", "stathmin", "stathmin-like 2 protein (STMN2)", "yeast two-hybrid", ""], "arnumber": "6075813"}
