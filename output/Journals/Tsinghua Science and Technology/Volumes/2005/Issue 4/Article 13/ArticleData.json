Many OREBP transcription factors regulate gene expression in response to drought, high-salt, and cold stresses by binding specifically to the dehydration-responsive element (ORE). ORE-binding proteins, such as CBF1, OREB1A, and OREB2A, have been cloned from Arabidopsis thaliana and have been proved to play an important role in stress response of Arabidopsis and several other plants. In this study, the OsDREB1 gene was transferred to tobacco plants by the Agrobacterium-mediated transfer method, and 16 transgenic plants were identified. PCR analysis demonstrates that the foreign genes have been integrated into the tobacco genome. Results of freezing stress experiments indicate that the transgenic plants have enhanced cold tolerance.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "478", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "483", "date_publication": "Aug. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "478 - 483"}, "authors": ["Ping Li", "Feng Chen", "Chao Quan", "Guiyou Zhang"], "keywords": ["Bioinformatics", "Conductivity", "DNA", "Genomics", "Proteins", "Stress", "Temperature", "OsDREB1", "cold stress", "transcription factor", "transformation", ""], "arnumber": "6075812"}
