In this study, the Osdof28 gene, which codes a characteristic amino acid sequence of the DOF transcription factor family, was screened from rice (Oryza sativa japonica) using a yeast one-hybrid assay. Great amounts of the Osdof28 transcripts were found to accumulate in stems and leaves, with less in the roots, and no detectable transcription found in the germs. Osdof28 can be induced by salicylic acid and INA, which suggests that it may be related to the plant systemic acquired resistance (SAR). The relationship was confirmed through biological induction of SAR using Xanthomonascampestrispv. oryzae, with more expression of Osdof28 observed in the systemic tissues after infection.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "454", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "460", "date_publication": "Aug. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "454 - 460"}, "authors": ["Feng Chen", "Yu Chen", "Yixiang Dong", "Xin Li", "Meng Xu", "Chao Zhang", "Yongbin Yan", "Guiyou Zhang"], "keywords": ["Amino acids", "Bioinformatics", "DNA", "Fingers", "Genomics", "Proteins", "Zinc", "DOF", "salicylic acid", "systemic acquired resistance (SAR)", "transcription factor", "yeast-one-hybrid", ""], "arnumber": "6075809"}
