As a result of coating, the porous alumina sample exhibits a sharp transition from insulating to conducting due to a thin silver layer on the inner pore surfaces. Systematic studies have been carried out to investigate the coating kinetics by employment of scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and computer simulation. Both coating procedures and effects of processing parameters on the quality of films are reported. Also, this paper presents the film bonding strength to the substrate, effects of sintering, and conduction mechanism of coated composite. The fundamental silver electroless-plating mechanism has been identified based on computer modeling. The simulation results indicate an excellent agreement between the silver deposition behavior and the physical model applied.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "680", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "689", "date_publication": "Dec. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "680 - 689"}, "authors": ["Fang Mei", "Donglu Shi"], "keywords": ["Coatings", "Conductivity", "Films", "Silver", "Substrates", "Surface treatment", "deposition kinetics", "electroless plating", "thin silver films", ""], "arnumber": "6075844"}
