The Cr nano-interlayers were prepared by sputter deposition with a thickness about 70\u2013100 nm. CrN coatings were also prepared by sputter deposition on the Cr nano-interlayers. The crystal structures, microhardness, and scratch resistance of CrN/Cr coatings were determined. Results show that the Cr nano-interlayers improve scratch resistance and the microhardness of CrN coated steels. A rapid heat treatment with infrared (I R) was performed for coated specimens in the attempt to improve bonding. With IR heat treatments, the beneficial effect of the Cr nano-interlayers was clearly observed. Without the Cr nano-interlayers, severe cracks on the surface of coatings were observed after IR heat treatment. However, with a Cr interlayer, no cracks on the surface of CrN coatings were observed after the heat treatment. The scratch resistance of coatings was also affected by the Cr nano-interlayers. The scratch track was clean and showed significantly smaller amount of scratch debris for CrN coatings with Cr interlayers than those without the Cr nano-interlayers. The microhardness of coatings with the Cr nano-interlayers is higher than those without the Cr nano-interlayers after IR heat treatment. The Cr and CrN phase have been identified with X-ray diffraction analysis, and the results show that the higher the nitrogen content in the sputtering gas, the stronger the CrN peaks observed in the diffraction patterns are.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "690", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "698", "date_publication": "Dec. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "690 - 698"}, "authors": ["Gaoren Li", "Pranav Deshpande", "J.
