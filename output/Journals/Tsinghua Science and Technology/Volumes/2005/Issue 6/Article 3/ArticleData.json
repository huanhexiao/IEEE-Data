This paper provides a review how thin film multilayers and nanocomposites result in hard, tough, low-friction coatings. Approaches to couple multilayered and nanocomposite materials with other surface engineering strategies to achieve higher levels of performance in a variety of tribological applications are also discussed. Encapsulating lubricious phases in hard nanocomposite matrices is one approach that is discussed in detail. Results from state-of-the-art \u201cchameleon\u201d nanocomposites that exhibit reversible adaptability to ambient humidity or temperature are presented.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "665", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "679", "date_publication": "Dec. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "665 - 679"}, "authors": ["A.
