The ultimate goal of this work is the replacement of chromate passivation and paint pretreatments, as well as overcoming the shortcomings of organic coatings formulated in the modern environmentally friendly world, thus without chromate or chromated pigments, volatile organic carbon (VOC) containing compounds or harazardous air pollutants (HAPs).", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "639", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "664", "date_publication": "Dec. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "639 - 664"}, "authors": ["W.
