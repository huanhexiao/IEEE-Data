The molecular ratio between the repeating unit of PVP and AgNO3 plays a crucial role in determining the geometric shape of the product. Such novel-type Ag nanotubes were self-assembled by Ag nanoparticles, which had largely similar crystallographic orientation, forming a texture. The fact that nanoparticles without anisotropic crystal structures can form such superstructures by self-assembly may open a window for understanding a range of nanotube formation processes.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "736", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "740", "date_publication": "Dec. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "736 - 740"}, "authors": ["Guodan Wei", "Cewen Nan", "Oapeng Yu"], "keywords": ["Electron tubes", "Nanoparticles", "Nanotubes", "Self-assembly", "Silver", "nanotubes", "self-assemble", "silver", "solvothermal processing", ""], "arnumber": "6076285"}
