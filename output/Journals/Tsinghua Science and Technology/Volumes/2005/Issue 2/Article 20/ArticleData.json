Risk theory is mainly concerned with ruin probability, and a tight bound for ruin probability is the best for practical use. This paper presents a discrete time risk model with stochastic investment return. Conditional expectation properties and martingale inequalities are used to obtain both exponential and non-exponential upper bounds for the ruin probability.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "254", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "258", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "254 - 258"}, "authors": ["Lihong Zhang"], "keywords": ["Biological system modeling", "Economic indicators", "Insurance", "Investments", "Random variables", "Stochastic processes", "Upper bound", "conditional expectation", "decreasing failure rate (DFR)", "martingale", "new better than used (NBU) distribution", "new worse than used (NWU) distribution", "stochastic investment return", ""], "arnumber": "6076027"}
