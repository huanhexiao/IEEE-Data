The time is discretized stochastically using the times when claims occur, using Doob's stopping time theorem and martingale inequalities to obtain expressions for the ruin probability as well as both exponential and non-exponential upper bounds for the ruin probability for an infinite time horizon. Numerical results are included to illustrate the accuracy of the non-exponential bound.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "259", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "264", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "259 - 264"}, "authors": ["Lihong Zhang"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Companies", "Insurance", "Mathematical model", "Random variables", "Time series analysis", "Upper bound", "linear model", "martingale", "martingale inequality", "ruin probability", "stopping time", "upper bound for ruin probability", ""], "arnumber": "6076028"}
