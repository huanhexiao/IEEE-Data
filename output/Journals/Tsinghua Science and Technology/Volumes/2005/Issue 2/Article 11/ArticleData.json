The model including an eccentricity factor proposed by Wierzbicki et al. and modified by Singace et al. has been taken one step further to obtain the real load-displacement history and to investigate eccentricity effects. The influence of the eccentricity parameter m on the mean crushing load was discussed according to the present analysis. Experiments were carried out to verify the eccentricity effects. The results show that experimental and theoretical load-displacement curves match perfectly, especially in terms of half wavelength. Unlike previous researchs, the results suggest that m is not a fixed value and may affect energy absorption.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "196", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "203", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "196 - 203"}, "authors": ["Hongwei Song", "Zijie Fan", "Huifeng Tan", "Qingchun Wang"], "keywords": ["Absorption", "Electron tubes", "History", "Load modeling", "Loading", "Materials", "Metals", "axial crushing", "eccentricity", "energy absorption", "metal tube", "rigid plastic", ""], "arnumber": "6076018"}
