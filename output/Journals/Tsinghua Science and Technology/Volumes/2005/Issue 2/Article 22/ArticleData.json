This paper uses system dynamics to analyze the area logistics system and establishes a system dynamics model for the area logistics system based on the characteristics of the area logistics system and system dynamics. Numerical simulations with the system dynamic model were used to analyze a logistic system. Analysis of the Guangzhou economy shows that the model can reflect the actual state of the system objectively and can be used to make policy and harmonize environment.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "265", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "269", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "265 - 269"}, "authors": ["Shouping Gui", "Qiang Zhu", "Lifang Lu"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Computational modeling", "Economic indicators", "Equations", "Investments", "Logistics", "Mathematical model", "area logistics system", "simulation", "system dynamics", ""], "arnumber": "6076029"}
