The retailer is loss averse. The results show that the optimal production quantity with decentralized decision making with a wholesale price contract is less than that with centralized decision making. The supply chain can achieve channel coordination with buy back and target rebate contracts. With buy back contracts, the supply chain system profits can be allocated arbitrarily between the supplier and retailer. A new kind of contract, the incremental buy back contract, gives similar results as with the buy back contract. The advantages and drawbacks of these three types of contracts are analyzed with numerical examples.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "133", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "140", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "133 - 140"}, "authors": ["Long Zhang", "Shiji Song", "Cheng Wu"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Contracts", "Decision making", "Marketing and sales", "Stochastic processes", "Supply chains", "channel coordination", "risk analysis", "supply chain management", "supply contract", ""], "arnumber": "6076008"}
