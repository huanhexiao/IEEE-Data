The nonlinearity of the oil viscosity, the oil flow characteristics, and the coupling between the oil and the physical structure were included in a mathematical model of the oil-damping shock absorber to attenuate vibrations. The results of multi-parameter-coupled dynamic tests show that the mathematical model accurately simulates the actual physical system of the oildamping shock absorber. The model could be used for engineering designs of vibration-impact isolation of electronic-packaging components.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "216", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "220", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "216 - 220"}, "authors": ["Ping Yang"], "keywords": ["Damping", "Force", "Mathematical model", "Orifices", "Shock absorbers", "Vehicle dynamics", "Vibrations", "damping characteristics", "electronic-packaging components", "oil-damping shock absorber", "packaging", ""], "arnumber": "6076021"}
