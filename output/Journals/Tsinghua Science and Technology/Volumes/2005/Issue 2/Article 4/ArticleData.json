In this paper, an integrated method for real-time multi-view face detection and pose estimation is presented. A simple-to-complex and coarse-to-fine view-based detector architecture has been designed to detect multiview faces and estimate their poses efficiently. Both the pose estimators and the view-based face/nonface detectors are trained by a cost-sensitive AdaBoost algorithm to improve the generalization ability. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-view face detector, which can be constructed easily, gives more robust face detection and pose estimation and has a faster real-time detection speed compared with other conventional methods.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "152", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "157", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "152 - 157"}, "authors": ["Yong Ma", "Xiaoqing Ding"], "keywords": ["Detectors", "Estimation", "Face", "Face detection", "Real time systems", "Training", "Training data", "AdaBoost", "face detection", "multi-view face detection", "pose estimation", ""], "arnumber": "6076011"}
