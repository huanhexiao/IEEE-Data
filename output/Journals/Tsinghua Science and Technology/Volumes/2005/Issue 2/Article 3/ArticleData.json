At present, there are no reported studies of the isomorphic class of the Montgomery-form elliptic curve over a finite field. This paper investigates the isomorphism of Montgomery-form elliptic curves via the isomorphism of Weierstrass-form elliptic curves and gives a table of (nearly) all the forms of Montgomeryform elliptic curves suitable for cryptographic usage. Then, an algorithm for generating a secure elliptic curve with Montgomery-form is presented. The most important advantages of the new algorithm are that it avoids the transformation from an elliptic curve's Weierstrass-form to its Montgomery-form, and that it decreases the probability of collision. So, the proposed algorithem is quicker, simpler, and more efficient than the old ones.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "145", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "151", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "145 - 151"}, "authors": ["Duo Liu", "Tao Song", "Yiqi Dai"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Elliptic curve cryptography", "Elliptic curves", "Equations", "Finite element methods", "Galois fields", "Montgomery-form", "cryptography", "elliptic curve", "isomorphism", ""], "arnumber": "6076010"}
