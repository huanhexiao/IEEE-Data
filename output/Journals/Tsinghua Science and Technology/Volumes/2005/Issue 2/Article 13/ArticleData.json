There are still many uncertainties concerning these two issues. This paper reviews the concepts of project boundary setting and leakage in COM projects, cites the types and sources of leakage, discusses the principles for determining leakage, and gives some proposed methods for dealing with leakage. A case study, using several steps to solve the boundary and leakage problems, shows how the analyzed principles and treatments can be implemented in a real project. Based on the result of the case study, the methods discussed are shown to be appropriate for settling leakage issues.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "209", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "215", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "209 - 215"}, "authors": ["Chen Zou", "Shujuan Wang", "Maosheng Duan", "Changhe Chen"], "keywords": ["Boilers", "Carbon dioxide", "Coal", "Global warming", "Monitoring", "Natural gas", "Production", "boundary", "clean development mechanism", "leakage", ""], "arnumber": "6076020"}
