In the six-sequence fault network, the ratio of the root-mean square value of the fault current from two terminals is the function of the line impedance, the system impedance, and the fault distance away from the buses. A fault location equation is given to relate these factors. For extremely long transmission lines, the distributed capacitance is divided by the fault point and allocated to the two terminals of the transmission line in a lumped parameter to eliminate the influence of the distributed capacitance on the location accuracy. There is no limit on fault type and synchronization of the sampling data. Simulation results show that the location accuracy is high with an average error about 2%, and it is not influenced by factors such as the load current, the operating mode of the power system, or the fault resistance.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "247", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "253", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "247 - 253"}, "authors": ["Chunju Fan", "Huarong Cai", "Weiyong Yu"], "keywords": ["Capacitance", "Circuit faults", "Fault location", "Impedance", "Integrated circuit modeling", "Joints", "Power transmission lines", "fault location", "joint parallel line", "six-sequence components", "two-terminal", ""], "arnumber": "6076026"}
