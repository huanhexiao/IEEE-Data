Stream weight training based on minimum classification error criterion is discussed for use in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR). We present the lattice rescoring and Viterbi approaches for calculating the loss function of continuous speech. The experimental results show that in the case of clean audio, the system performance can be improved by 36.1% in relative word error rate reduction when using state-based stream weights trained by a Viterbi approach, compared to an audio only speech recognition system. Further experimental results demonstrate that our audio-visual LVCSR system provides significant enhancement of robustness in noisy environments.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "141", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "144", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "141 - 144"}, "authors": ["Peng Liu", "Zuoying Wang"], "keywords": ["Error analysis", "Hidden Markov models", "Lattices", "Speech", "Speech recognition", "Training", "Viterbi algorithm", "audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR)", "discriminative training", "large vocabulary continuous speech recognition (LVCSR)", "minimum classification error (MCE)", ""], "arnumber": "6076009"}
