The MPPT is based on a highly efficient boost converter with insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) power switch. The reference voltage for MPPT is obtained by artificial neural network (ANN) with gradient descent momentum algorithm. The tracking algorithm changes the duty-cycle of the converter so that the PV-module voltage equals the voltage corresponding to the MPPT at any given insolation, temperature, and load conditions. For fast response, the system is implemented using digital signal processor (DSP). The overall system stability is improved by including a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, which is also used to match the reference and battery voltage levels. The controller, based on the information supplied by the ANN, generates the boost converter duty-cycle. The energy obtained is used to charge the lithium ion battery stack for the solar vehicle. The experimental and simulation results show that the proposed scheme is highly efficient.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "204", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "208", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "204 - 208"}, "authors": ["Theodore Amissah Ocran", "Junyi Cao", "Binggang Cao", "Xinghua Sun"], "keywords": ["Arrays", "Artificial neural networks", "Neurons", "Photovoltaic systems", "Training", "USA Councils", "artificial neural network", "digital signal processor", "maximum power point tracker (MPPT)", "photovoltaic module", "solar electric vehicle", ""], "arnumber": "6076019"}
