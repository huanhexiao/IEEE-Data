The method distributes particles between nodes based on the spatial decomposition strategy to reduce inter-node communication costs. The method also partitions particle pairs within each node using the force decomposition strategy to improve the load balance for each node. Simulation results for a nucleation process with 4 000 000 particles show that the hybrid method achieves better parallel performance than either spatial or force decomposition alone, especially when applied to a large scale particle system with non-uniform spatial density.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "183", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "188", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "183 - 188"}, "authors": ["Bing Wang", "Jiwu Shu", "Weimin Zheng", "Jinzhao Wang", "Min Chen"], "keywords": ["Clustering algorithms", "Computational modeling", "Computer architecture", "Force", "Load modeling", "Matrix decomposition", "Scalability", "cluster computing", "decomposition", "molecular dynamics", "symmetric multi-processor (SMP)", ""], "arnumber": "6076016"}
