A new AR model called the time varying parameter AR model is proposed for solution of non-stationary time series with finite length. The auto-covariances of time series simulated by means of several AR models are analyzed. The result shows that the new AR model can be used to simulate and generate a new time series with the auto-covariance same as the original time series. The size curves of cocoon filaments regarded as non-stationary time series with finite length are experimentally simulated. The simulation results are significantly better than those obtained so far, and illustrate the availability of the time varying parameter AR model. The results are useful for analyzing and simulating non-stationary time series with finite length.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "162", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "168", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "162 - 168"}, "authors": ["Wanchun Fei", "Lun Bai"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Biological system modeling", "Educational institutions", "Least squares methods", "Three dimensional displays", "Time series analysis", "White noise", "auto-covariance", "auto-regressive model", "non-stationary", "size curve of cocoon filament", "time series analysis", ""], "arnumber": "6076013"}
