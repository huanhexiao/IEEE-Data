However, MFCC is very sensitive to noise interference, which tends to drastically degrade the performance of recognition systems because of the mismatches between training and testing. In this paper, the logarithmic transformation in the standard MFCC analysis is replaced by a combined function to improve the noisy sensitivity. The proposed feature extraction process is also combined with speech enhancement methods, such as spectral subtraction and median-filter to further suppress the noise. Experiments show that the proposed robust MFCC-based FCC-based feature significantly reduces the recognition error rate over a wide signal-to-noise ratio range.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "158", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "161", "date_publication": "April 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "158 - 161"}, "authors": ["Zunjing Wu", "Zhigang Cao"], "keywords": ["Feature extraction", "Mel frequency cepstral coefficient", "Noise measurement", "Robustness", "Signal to noise ratio", "Speech", "Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC)", "feature extraction", "robust speaker identification", ""], "arnumber": "6076012"}
