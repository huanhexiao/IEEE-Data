But the expense of fibre channel devices limits FC-SAN applications. The use of IP networks instead of fibre channel networks will reduce SAN cost, but will also reduce the performance. Therefore, small computer system interface (SCSI) devices were considered to replace FC disks to reduce the SAN cost. A driver for the FC network adapter and the FC target, designed and implemented to support this structure, obeys the SCSI protocol and works in target mode with 200 MB/s bandwidth. The FC target architecture and implementation were compared with the FC initiator. The SCSI command transfer process in the FC layer was described. The performance test results show that the maximum I/O throughput reachs 167 MB/s for read requests and 196 MB/s for write requests (FC bandwidth is 200 MB/s), verifying that the FC target is very efficient. The modularization, efficiency, and low cost of the FC target will enable SAN and fibre channel to be more widely used in applications.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "115", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "121", "date_publication": "Feb. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "115 - 121"}, "authors": ["Hao Wu", "Jiwu Shu", "Dongchan Wen", "Weimin Zheng"], "keywords": ["Bandwidth", "Computers", "Hardware", "Microprogramming", "Protocols", "Software architecture", "Storage area networks", "FC target", "SCSI target middle level (STML)", "fibre channel protocol (FCP)", "small computer system interface (SCSI)", "storage area networks (SAN)", ""], "arnumber": "6076002"}
