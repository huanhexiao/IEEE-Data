The contract coordinates the supplier's actions with voluntary compliance; the contract is symmetric in the sense that both the supplier's and retailer's profits are linearly correlated and is more easily implemented in some situations. The impact of the retailer's loss aversion on his effort is investigated based on the contract. After characterizing the retailer's optimal solutions, this paper demonstrates that contrary to intuition, loss aversion weakens incentives for retailer's sales effort and the retailer's optimal effort decreases as the loss aversion increases.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "102", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "107", "date_publication": "Feb. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "102 - 107"}, "authors": ["Hansheng Suo", "Jingchun Wang", "Yihui Jin"], "keywords": ["Advertising", "Analytical models", "Contracts", "Joints", "Probability density function", "Supply chains", "loss aversion", "sales effort", "supply chain coordination", ""], "arnumber": "6076000"}
