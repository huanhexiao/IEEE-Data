In this paper, the FMM based on Taylor expansions is combined with the boundary element method (BEM) for three-dimensional elastostatic problems to solve thin plate and shell structures. The fast multipole boundary element method (FM-BEM) requires O(N) operations and memory for problems with N unknowns. The numerical results indicate that for the analysis of thin structures, the FM-BEM is much more efficient than the conventional BEM and the accuracy achieved is sufficient for engineering applications.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "67", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "75", "date_publication": "Feb. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "67 - 75"}, "authors": ["Libin Zhao", "Zhenhan Yao"], "keywords": ["Boundary element methods", "Equations", "Integral equations", "Kernel", "Memory management", "Taylor series", "Vectors", "Taylor series", "boundary element method", "multipole expansion", "thin structures", ""], "arnumber": "6075996"}
