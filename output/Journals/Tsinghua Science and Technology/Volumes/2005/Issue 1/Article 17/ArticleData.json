However, current storage systems on clustered hosts and multiple operating systems are not practical. This paper presents a storage virtualization system based on a SCSI target simulator in a SAN to solve these problems. This storage virtualization system runs in the target hosts of the SAN, dynamically stores the physical information, and uses the mapping table method to modify the SCSI command addresses. The system uses the bitmap technique to manage the free space. The storage virtualization system provides various functions, such as logical volume resizing, data mirroring, and snapshots, and is compatible with clustered hosts and multiple operating systems, such as Windows NT and RedHat.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "122", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "127", "date_publication": "Feb. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "122 - 127"}, "authors": ["Bigang Li", "Jiwu Shu", "Weimin Zheng"], "keywords": ["Equations", "File systems", "Kernel", "Linux", "Servers", "Storage area networks", "SCSI", "storage area networks (SANs)", "storage pool", "virtualization", ""], "arnumber": "6076003"}
