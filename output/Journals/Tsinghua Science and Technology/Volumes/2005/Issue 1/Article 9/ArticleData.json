Previous studies of the MWLS method for elastostatics and wave propagation problems have shown that the MWLS method possesses several advantages, such as high accuracy, high convergence rate, good stability, and high computational efficiency. In this paper, the MWLS method is extended to heat conduction problems. The MWLS computational parameters are chosen based on a thorough numerical study of 1-dimensional problems. Several 2-dimensional examples show that the MWLS method is much faster than the element free Galerkin method (EFGM), while the accuracy of the MWLS method is close to, or even better than the EFGM. These numerical results demonstrate that the MWLS method has good potential for numerical analyses of heat transfer problems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "61", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "66", "date_publication": "Feb. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "61 - 66"}, "authors": ["Yan Liu", "Xiong Zhang", "Mingwan Lu"], "keywords": ["Boundary conditions", "Equations", "Finite element methods", "Heat transfer", "Heating", "Moment methods", "Steady-state", "heat conduction", "least-squares", "meshless", "steady-state", ""], "arnumber": "6075995"}
