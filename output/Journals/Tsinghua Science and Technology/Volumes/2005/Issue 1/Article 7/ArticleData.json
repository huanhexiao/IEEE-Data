A programming model, multipole boundary element method (BEM), was developed for 3-D elastic contact with friction to replace the Monte Carlo method. A numerical example shows that the optimization programming model for the point-to-surface contact with friction and the fast optimization generalized minimal residual algorithm (GMRES(m)) significantly improve the analysis of such problems relative to the conventional BEM.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "51", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "56", "date_publication": "Feb. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "51 - 56"}, "authors": ["Chunxiao Yu", "Guangxian Shen", "Deyi Liu"], "keywords": ["Equations", "Finite element methods", "Friction", "Mathematical model", "Monte Carlo methods", "Noise measurement", "Programming", "generalized minimal residual algorithm (GMRES(m))", "multipole boundary element method", "nonlinear programming", "point-to-surface contact", ""], "arnumber": "6075993"}
