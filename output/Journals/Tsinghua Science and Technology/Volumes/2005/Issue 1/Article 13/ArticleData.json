The sufficient and necessary conditions for team localization are proposed. A localization and object tracking approach based on statistical operators and graph searching algorithms is presented for a team of robots localized with heterogeneous sensors. The approach was implemented in an experimental platform consisting of car-like mobile robots equipped with omnidirectional video cameras and IEEE 802.11b wireless networking. The experimental results validate the approach.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "91", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "101", "date_publication": "Feb. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "91 - 101"}, "authors": ["Fan Zhang", "Guilherme S.
