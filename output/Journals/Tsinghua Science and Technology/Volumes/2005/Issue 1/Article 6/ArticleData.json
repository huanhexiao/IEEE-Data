This method is based on the coincident collocation of non-singular boundary integral equations (BIEs) of the potential and its derivatives, where the nodal potential derivatives are considered independent of the nodal potential and flux. The system equation is solved to determine the unknown boundary potentials and fluxes, with high accuracy boundary nodal potential derivatives obtained from the solution at the same time. A modified Gaussian elimination algorithm was developed to improve the solution efficiency of the final system equation. Numerical examples verify the validity of the proposed algorithm.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "43", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "50", "date_publication": "Feb. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "43 - 50"}, "authors": ["Haibo Chen", "JlN Jianfeng", "Peiqiang Zhang", "L\u00fc Pin"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Boundary conditions", "Boundary element methods", "Equations", "Integral equations", "Mathematical model", "boundary element method", "non-singular boundary integral equation", "potential derivatives", "potential problem", ""], "arnumber": "6075992"}
