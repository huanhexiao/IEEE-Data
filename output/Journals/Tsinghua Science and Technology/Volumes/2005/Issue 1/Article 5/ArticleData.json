Reliable and efficient a posteriori error estimates play key roles for both adaptive finite element and boundary element methods. The aim of this paper is to develop a posteriori error estimates for boundary element methods. The standard a posteriori error estimates for boundary element methods are obtained from the classical boundary integral equations. This paper presents hyper-singular a posteriori error estimates based on the hyper-singular integral equations. Three kinds of residuals are used as the estimates for boundary element errors. The theoretical analysis and numerical examples show that the hypersingular residuals are good a posteriori error indicators in many adaptive boundary element computations.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "35", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "42", "date_publication": "Feb. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "35 - 42"}, "authors": ["Dehao Yu", "Longhua Zhao"], "keywords": ["Approximation methods", "Boundary element methods", "Boundary value problems", "Equations", "Finite element methods", "Integral equations", "Mathematical model", "a posteriori error estimate", "boundary integral equation", "hyper-singular residual", "natural boundary reduction", "pseudo-differential operator", ""], "arnumber": "6075991"}
