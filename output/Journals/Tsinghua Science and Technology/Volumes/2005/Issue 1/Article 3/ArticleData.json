The algorithms employ nonconforming discretizations for solving 3-D boundary element models, which provide much needed flexibility in the boundary element modeling for 3-D contact problems. These algorithms are implemented in a new 3-D boundary element code and verified using several examples. For the numerical examples studied, the results using the new boundary element algorithms match very well with the results using a commercial finite element code, and clearly demonstrate the feasibility of the new boundary element approach for 3-D contact analysis.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "16", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "29", "date_publication": "Feb. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "16 - 29"}, "authors": ["Bangyong Keum", "Yijun Liu"], "keywords": ["Equations", "Finite element methods", "Mathematical model", "Shape", "Solid modeling", "Stress", "Vectors", "3-D contact problems", "boundary element method", "nonconforming discretizations", ""], "arnumber": "6075989"}
