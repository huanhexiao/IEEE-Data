The composites consist of inclusion and matrix phases. The micromechanics method gives formulae for the overall material constants as functions of the concentration matrix, while the boundary element simulation gives numerical solutions of the boundary displacement and electric potential equations for inclusion or hole problems. Numerical results for a piezoelectric plate with circular inclusions are presented to illustrate applications of the proposed micromechanics-BEM formulation.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "30", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "34", "date_publication": "Feb. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "30 - 34"}, "authors": ["Qinghua Qin"], "keywords": ["Electric potential", "Equations", "Finite element methods", "Mathematical model", "Solids", "Strain", "boundary element method (BEM)", "micromechanics", "piezoelectric", ""], "arnumber": "6075990"}
