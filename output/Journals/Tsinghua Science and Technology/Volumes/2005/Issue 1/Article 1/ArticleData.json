Using the directly derived non-hyper-singular integral equations for displacement gradients, simple and straightforward derivations of weakly singular traction BIEs for solids undergoing small deformations are also presented. As a framework for meshless approaches, the MLPG weak forms provide the most general basis for the numerical solution of the non-hyper-singular displacement and traction BIEs. By employing the various types of test functions, several types of MLPG/BIEs are formulated. Numerical examples show that the present methods are very promising, especially for solving the elastic problems in which the singularities in displacements, strains, and stresses are of primary concern.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "7", "date_publication": "Feb. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "1 - 7"}, "authors": ["Zhidong Han", "Zhenhan Yao", "S.
