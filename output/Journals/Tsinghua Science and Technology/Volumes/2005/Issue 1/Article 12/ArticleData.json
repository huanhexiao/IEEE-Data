The algorithm is based on a fixed-mesh-based contour model, which starts at the bounding box of the difference map between an input image and its background and ends at a final contour. An adaptive algorithm was developed to calculate an appropriate energy threshold to control the contours to identify the foreground silhouettes. Experiments show that this method more successfully ignores the negative influence of image noise to obtain an accurate foreground map than other foreground detection algorithms. Most shadow pixels are also eliminated by this method.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "82", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "90", "date_publication": "Feb. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "82 - 90"}, "authors": ["Ying Huang", "Xiaoqing Ding"], "keywords": ["Adaptation models", "Computational efficiency", "Computational modeling", "Convergence", "Noise", "Real time systems", "Shape", "active contour model", "adaptive energy threshold", "background subtraction", "fixed square meshes", "real-time foreground detection", "snake border", ""], "arnumber": "6075998"}
