The elements in the contact and plastic zones should be refined to obtain accurate information about the real size, displacement, and traction in the contact zone. However, the increase in the number of degrees of freedom is limited when traditional boundary element method (BEM) is used with the larger memory size and long CPU time required for the solution procedure. This paper describes the additional mathematical friction model to the 3-D elastic multipole BEM to develop a 3-D elasto-plastic contact multipole BEM. Numerical tests show that with this new method, the needed computer memory size is only 2% of the traditional BEM model with friction, which erases large-scale computing with refined meshes and improves the computational accuracy.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "57", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "60", "date_publication": "Feb. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "57 - 60"}, "authors": ["Deyi Liu", "Guangxian Shen"], "keywords": ["Computational modeling", "Educational institutions", "Equations", "Friction", "Mathematical model", "Plastics", "Stress", "boundary element method", "elasto-plastic contact", "multipole residual algorithm", "point-to-surface model", ""], "arnumber": "6075994"}
