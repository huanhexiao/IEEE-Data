A new methodology of generating and optimizing strategy of organizational course of actions (COA) was illuminated with a joint campaign. A process of generating and optimizing COA in military force was modeled. And enumerative and heuristic techniques were employed to search optimal strategy for the case of joint campaign. The complex between the two approaches to find best strategy was analyzed. The results from our case were given and compared with reality of joint campaign, on which deficiency of models was taken apart. The optimal COA obtained from our new methodology under diverse campaigns conditions, is given and analyzed. Results from the simulation of the COA show that our approach to solve optimal strategy of organizational processes accords with traits of general landing campaign.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "836", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "843", "date_publication": "Dec. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "836 - 843"}, "authors": ["Dongsheng Yang", "Zhong Liu", "Weiming Zhang", "Ping Su"], "keywords": ["Airports", "Force", "Joints", "Missiles", "Organizations", "Planning", "Vectors", "course of actions (COA)", "evolution of organization", "military force", "mission planning", ""], "arnumber": "6075753"}
