This paper examines the user's demand of vague queries, and then proposes system architecture of LD ISs. In particular, based on D-tree index structure, it takes the method of membership function in fuzzy set theory to provide a more user-oriented approach to constructing overlapping location-dependent data regions, called complementary void overlapping data regions. This structure, carrying more information with less additional storage, brings balance between perceived usefulness and responsiveness, energy consumption, and bandwidth contention in wireless communications. The simulations show that this method is more flexible and practical in practice.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "824", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "829", "date_publication": "Dec. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "824 - 829"}, "authors": ["Liju Lai", "Demin Li", "Fan Zhang", "Ying Zhu", "Hao Xu"], "keywords": ["Computer architecture", "Fuzzy set theory", "Indexes", "Information services", "Mobile communication", "Mobile computing", "Servers", "complementary void overlapping", "index structure", "location-dependent information services (LDISs)", ""], "arnumber": "6075751"}
