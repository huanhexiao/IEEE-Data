The ICT transformation processes of these companies are introduced briefly. A strategic grid model was used, which shows that depending on a company's strategic grid cell, different behavior patterns can be observed, in terms of Nolan's stage model. The analysis shows that companies allocated in the \u201cturnaround\u201d and \u201cstrategic\u201d cell do not behave accordingly to Nolan's stage model. A few years after China first application for a World Trade Organization (WTO) membership renewal in 1986, observed companies skipped some of Nolan's stages to achieve an accelerated ICT transformation. Therefore, a fast transformation of ICT plays a major role for Chinese tobacco companies to face the challenges entailed by an open door policy and the WTO entry. This conclusion is limited to companies that are allocated either in the \u201ctransformation\u201d cell or the \u201cstrategic\u201d cell.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "830", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "835", "date_publication": "Dec. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "830 - 835"}, "authors": ["Yan Zhu", "Axel Hochstein"], "keywords": ["Companies", "Industries", "Manufacturing", "Marketing and sales", "Production facilities", "Nolan's stage hypothesis", "information and communication technology (ICT) transformation", "strategic grid", "tobacco industry", ""], "arnumber": "6075752"}
