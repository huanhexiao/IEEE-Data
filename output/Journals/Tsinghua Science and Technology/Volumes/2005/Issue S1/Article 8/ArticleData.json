Semantic-oriented approach is one of the recent developments in sentiment classification. Up to now, most research of sentiment classification is on English reviews, and little work has been done on Chinese reviews using sentiment classification. The detailed techniques used in English review cannot be applied directly to Chinese reviews due to the different characteristics between these two languages. This study modified and improved the semantic-oriented approach to a 6-step process for Chinese review, focusing on the modification and improvement on the text segmentation and reference words pairs (RWPs) identification. Two experiments were conducted on book reviews and cell phone reviews. The results show that the performances of the proposed approach are comparable to those of the existing English reviews classification studies.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "797", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "802", "date_publication": "Dec. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "797 - 802"}, "authors": ["Qiang Ye", "Yijun Li", "Yiwen Zhang"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Book reviews", "Cellular phones", "Copper", "Motion pictures", "Search engines", "Semantics", "Chinese customer reviews", "books", "cell phones", "semantic orientation", "sentiment classification", ""], "arnumber": "6075747"}
