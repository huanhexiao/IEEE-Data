This paper uses multi-agent technology to construct an agent organization-based distributed intelligence decision support system (AOBDIDSS) structure model, applies generalized decision function (GDF) to the decomposition of decision task specifications, and determines decomposition criteria and properties of decision task specifications based on GDF. Because the task decomposition based on G DF is equivalent to the decomposition of Bayesian network, we present the representation and decomposition methods of decision tasks and properties based on Bayesian network. On these bases, the decision task decomposition problems can be entailed basically to construct a multi-sectioned Bayesian network and sub-Bayesian networks related to decision task specifications. The method is used to analyze the representation and decomposition of decision tasks in medical diagnosis. The results show that the model and method is not only feasible, but also effective and novel.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "811", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "816", "date_publication": "Dec. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "811 - 816"}, "authors": ["Shanlin Yang", "Xiaojian Hu", "Fang Fang"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Bayesian methods", "Decision support systems", "Educational institutions", "Medical diagnostic imaging", "Organizations", "Bayesian network", "agent organization-based distributed intelligence decision support system (AOBDIDSS)", "decision tasks", "generalized decision function (GDF)", ""], "arnumber": "6075749"}
