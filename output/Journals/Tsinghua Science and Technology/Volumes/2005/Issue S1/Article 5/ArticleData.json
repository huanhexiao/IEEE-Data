A two-dimensional taxonomy of user model was proposed in terms of the content and persistence of user characteristics. A user interest model and a customer lifetime value model were developed for the proposed taxonomy framework, to capture the time-dependent evolving nature of user's interests and his/her long-term profitability. The proposed models were empirically validated by using real customer data from a bee product company in health care industry. The experimental results show that these models provide effective assistant tools for the company to target its most valuable customers and implement one-to-one personalized services.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "772", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "777", "date_publication": "Dec. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "772 - 777"}, "authors": ["Lu Liu", "Lihua Wu"], "keywords": ["Adaptation models", "Biological system modeling", "Companies", "Profitability", "Recommender systems", "Taxonomy", "Vectors", "customer lifetime value (CLV)", "customer relationship management (CRM)", "e-commerce", "recommender systems", "user interest model", ""], "arnumber": "6075744"}
