With the extended SEIR model, namely E-SEIR, three aspects of information security policies (i. e., immunization, information security training, and user recovery support) are investigated in terms of their impacts on the email virus propagation. The results show that the E-SEIR model is suitable to reflect the propagation pattern of email virus, and may also be used in anti-virus policies simulation and evaluation.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "803", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "810", "date_publication": "Dec. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "803 - 810"}, "authors": ["Hua Yuan", "Guoqing Chen"], "keywords": ["Electronic mail", "Immune system", "Information security", "Internet", "Postal services", "Servers", "Training", "E-SEIR model", "email virus", "information security policy epidemiological", "propagation simulation", ""], "arnumber": "6075748"}
