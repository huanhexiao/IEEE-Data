This paper presents an effective case-based reasoning (CBR) capability model for solution selection in c-commerce applications, as CBR is widely used in knowledge management and electronic commerce. Based on the case-based competence model suggested by Smyth and McKenna, a directed graph was used to represent the collaborative reasoning history of CBR systems, where information of reasoning process ability was extracted. Experiment was carried out on a travel dataset. By integrating case-based competence and reasoning process ability, the capability is more suitable to reflect the real ability of CBR systems. The result shows that the proposed method can effectively evaluate the capability of CBR systems and enhance the performance of collaborative case-based reasoning in c-commerce environment.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "790", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "796", "date_publication": "Dec. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "790 - 796"}, "authors": ["Chenghong Zhang", "Langtao Chen", "Cheng Zhang", "Lihua Huang"], "keywords": ["Cognition", "Collaboration", "Companies", "Computational modeling", "History", "Ontologies", "capability", "case-based reasoning", "collaborative commerce", ""], "arnumber": "6075746"}
