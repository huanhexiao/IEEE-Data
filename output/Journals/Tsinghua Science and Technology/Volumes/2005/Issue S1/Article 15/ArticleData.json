The LBS, especially the GPS dispatching system, is often adopted by taxi operators for fleet management, but there is no theoretical analysis on the real value of location information for dispatching services. This paper presents four types of dispatching modes and how location information is obtained and used to support dispatching services. Then the Pros and Cons of different taxi dispatching modes were compared. It is concluded that different mode fits different situations, no one overwhelms all situation, even if the GPS-based dispatching mode. The value of the GPS-based dispatching service then was further analyzed through the case study of DaZhong Company in Shanghai, China. The results show that the use of the up-to-date GPS technology radically changes the traditional approaches to taxi dispatching and enables companies to enhance customers' satisfaction.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "844", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "851", "date_publication": "Dec. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "844 - 851"}, "authors": ["Zhengchuan Xu", "Huiliang Jin", "Hong Ling"], "keywords": ["Broadcasting", "Companies", "Dispatching", "Global Positioning System", "Mobile communication", "Mobile handsets", "Vehicles", "location-based service (LBS)", "mobile commerce", "taxi dispatching", ""], "arnumber": "6075754"}
