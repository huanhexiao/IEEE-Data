In this paper, we develop different pricing and ordering strategies with limited information requirements for e-retailers under the electronic business environment, and study the dynamics and performance of these strategies through multi-agent simulation. The results not only reproduce some phenomena in former literature, such as the \u201ctacit collusion\u201d and the cyclical price wars, but also generate new findings, for example, the \u201ctacit collusion\u201d does not always exist among hill-climbing e-retailers, and the cyclical price wars will be suppressed when e-retailers consider their competitors' strategies. The results show that in electronic business environments, to test different strategies and evaluate their performance by simulation before they are employed into practice is of great importance.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "778", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "789", "date_publication": "Dec. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "778 - 789"}, "authors": ["Ming Xie", "Jian Chen"], "keywords": ["Biological system modeling", "Computational modeling", "Estimation", "Learning", "Pricing", "Strontium", "agent-based simulation", "electronic business", "ordering strategy", "pricing strategy", ""], "arnumber": "6075745"}
