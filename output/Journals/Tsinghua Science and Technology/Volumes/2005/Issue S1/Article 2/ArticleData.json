This research discusses both assessment indicators and impact factors for EC success to help Chinese enterprises to achieve successful EC implementations. On the basis of literature review and experts survey, the research suggests some assessment indicators and impact factors for EC success. A hypothesis is proposed that leadership, strategy, management, organization, technology, customers, and suppliers factors would affect EC success. Furthermore, the research conducts an empirical study on the Chinese Electronic Information Industry to verify the hypothesis. Using factor analysis and regression analysis, the research finds out several critical factors-Ieadership, strategy, and organization-and critical sub-factors, such as leadership belief and organization management. These findings indicate the usefulness of this research model, especially for Chinese enterprises.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "746", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "752", "date_publication": "Dec. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "S1", "pages": "746 - 752"}, "authors": ["Hui Wang", "Jinghua Huang", "Chingting Lee"], "keywords": ["Companies", "Industries", "Lead", "Multivariate regression", "Standards organizations", "assessment indicators", "critical success factors", "electronic commerce success", "impact factors", ""], "arnumber": "6075741"}
