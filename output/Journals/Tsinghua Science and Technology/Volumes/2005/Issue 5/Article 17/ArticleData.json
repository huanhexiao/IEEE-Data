An atrium fire test case illustrated the code's superiority over code-type empirical models for both accuracy and capability. Four fire scenarios in the Tsinghua University Sports Center were then simulated. The smoke layer's descent speed was predicted for each case. The importance of the door effect was revealed and an additional mechanical ventilation system for the building was proved to be of no help. The door effect must be carefully considered in future fire safety designs.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "618", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "622", "date_publication": "Oct. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "618 - 622"}, "authors": ["Jianguo Chen", "Haixin Chen", "Song Fu"], "keywords": ["Computational fluid dynamics", "Computational modeling", "Fires", "Heating", "Mathematical model", "Ventilation", "computational fluid dynamics (CFD)", "door effect", "smoke management", "sports center fire", ""], "arnumber": "6075834"}
