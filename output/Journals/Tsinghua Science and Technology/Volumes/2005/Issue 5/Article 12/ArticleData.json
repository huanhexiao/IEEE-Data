However, because of its ill-posed ness and non-linearity, ECT image reconstruction has always been a challenge. A new genetic algorithm (GA) developed for ECT image reconstruction uses initial results from a linear back-projection, which is widely used for ECT image reconstruction to optimize the threshold and the maximum and minimum gray values for the image. The procedure avoids optimizing the gray values pixel by pixel and significantly reduces the search space dimension. Both simulations and static experimental results show that the method is efficient and capable of reconstructing high quality images. Evaluation criteria show that the GA-based method has smaller image error and greater correlation coefficients. In addition, the GA-based method converges quickly with a small number of iterations.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "587", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "592", "date_publication": "Oct. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "587 - 592"}, "authors": ["Mou Changhua", "Peng Lihui", "Yao Danya", "Xiao Deyun"], "keywords": ["Capacitance", "Correlation", "Electrical capacitance tomography", "Genetic algorithms", "Image reconstruction", "Permittivity", "electrical capacitance tomography", "genetic algorithm", "image reconstruction", ""], "arnumber": "6075829"}
