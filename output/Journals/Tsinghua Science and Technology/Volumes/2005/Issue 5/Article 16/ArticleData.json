Rapid prototyping control is used to reduce development time and eliminate errors during software development. This paper describes a high-efficiency development method and a flexible tool chain suitable for various applications in automotive engineering. The control algorithm can be deployed directly from a Matlab/Simulink/Stateflow environment into the ECU hardware together with an OSEK real-time operating system (RTOS). The system has been successfully used to develop a 20-kW fuel cell system ECU based on a Motorola PowerPC 555 (MPC555) microcontroller. The total software development time is greatly reduced and the code quality and reliability are greatly enhanced.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "610", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "617", "date_publication": "Oct. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "610 - 617"}, "authors": ["Shuo Tian", "Yuan Liu", "Wenchuan Xia", "Jianqiu Li", "Minggao Yang"], "keywords": ["Atmospheric modeling", "Automotive engineering", "Fuel cells", "Hardware", "Programming", "Prototypes", "Software algorithms", "OSEK", "automatic code generation", "automotive engineering", "electronic controller unit (ECU)", "embedded software development", "fuel cell", "rapid prototyping", "simulation", ""], "arnumber": "6075833"}
