However, the traditional definition of the percentile calculation is designed only for 1-D anthropometric data estimates. The same approach cannot be applied directly to 3-D anthropometric statistics otherwise it could lead to misinterpretations. In this paper, the influence of alignment references on 3-D anthropometric statistics is analyzed mathematically, which shows that different alignment reference points (for example, landmarks) for translation alignment could result in different object shapes if 3-D anthropometric data are processed for percentile values based on coordinates and that dimension percentile calculations based on coordinate statistics are incompatible with those traditionally based on individual dimensions.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "623", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "626", "date_publication": "Oct. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "623 - 626"}, "authors": ["Xiuwen Cai", "Zhizhonq Li", "Chien-Chit Chang", "Patrick Dempsey"], "keywords": ["Anthropometry", "Current measurement", "Ergonomics", "Foot", "Humans", "Shape", "USA Councils", "alignment", "percentile", "three-dimensional (3-D) anthropometry", ""], "arnumber": "6075835"}
