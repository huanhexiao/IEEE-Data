The cost and performance of various designs were estimated using the commercial software GT PRO. Improved GTCC output will increase the system efficiency which may induce total investment and will certainly increase the cumulative cash which then will induce the cost and the payback period. The relative annual fuel output increases almost in proportion to the relative GTCC output. China should select the gas turbine that provides the most economical output according to its specific conditions. The analysis shows that a GTCC power plant with a medium-sized 100 to 200MW output gas turbine is the most suitable for Chinese investors.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "633", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "636", "date_publication": "Oct. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "633 - 636"}, "authors": ["Xiaotao Zhang", "Hideaki Sugishita", "Weidou Ni", "Zheng Li"], "keywords": ["Economics", "Fuels", "Investments", "Natural gas", "Software", "Turbines", "cumulative cash flow", "gas turbine", "gas turbine combined cycle (GTCC)", "relative annual fuel output", "relative owner's cost", "relative years for payback", ""], "arnumber": "6075837"}
