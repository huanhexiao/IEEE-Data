The GSP parameters are divided into four dimensions representing the four major intermolecular forces. The values of the parameters were determined by regression using the nonlinear SIMPLEX optimization method to fit the LLE data of 548 ternary and 26 quaternary systems selected from the literature. LLE predictions of 8 ternary systems were then made using the fit parameters. Comparison of the results with predictions using the modified UNIFAC model shows that the GSP model has less adjustable parameters to achieve a similar accuracy and that the parameter values are easily acquired by analysis of available data.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "561", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "566", "date_publication": "Oct. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "561 - 566"}, "authors": ["Zhao Mo", "Chen Fuming"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Analytical models", "Correlation", "Data models", "Educational institutions", "Mathematical model", "Predictive models", "activity coefficient", "group contribution model", "group solubility parameter", "liquid-liquid equilibrium", ""], "arnumber": "6075824"}
