Many uncertain factors and high risk are inherent in the implementation of new green manufacturing methods. Because of the shortage of successful examples and complete and certain knowledge, decision-making methods using probabilities to represent risk, which need many examples, cannot be used to evaluate risk in the implementation of green manufacturing projects. Therefore, a fuzzy multiple attribute decision-making (FMADM) method was developed with a three-level hierarchical decision-making model to evaluate the aggregate risk for green manufacturing projects. A case study shows that the hierarchical decision-making model of the aggregate risk and the FMADM method effectively reflect the characteristics of the risk in green manufacturing projects.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "627", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "632", "date_publication": "Oct. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "627 - 632"}, "authors": ["Hua Liu", "Weiping Chen", "Zhixin Kang", "Tungwai Ngai", "Yuanyuan Li"], "keywords": ["Aggregates", "Certification", "Decision making", "Green products", "Manufacturing", "Pragmatics", "Production", "aggregate risk", "fuzzy logic", "fuzzy multiple attribute decision making", "green manufacturing", ""], "arnumber": "6075836"}
