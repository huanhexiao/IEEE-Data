The crocin family biosynthesis mechanism was studied using high pressure liquid chromatography (H PLC) to determinate the glucosyltransferase activity and to develop a method for synthesizing medicine from saffron cells. Previous studies indicated that two glucosyltransferases might be involved in the formation of crocetin glucosyl- and gentiobiosyl-esters. GTase 1 formed an ester bond between crocetin carboxyl groups and glucose moieties while GTase 2 catalyzed the formation of glucosidic bonds with glucosyl ester groups at both ends of the molecule. These enzymes can catalyze the formation of crocetin glucosides in vitro. GTase 1 activity is higher during the first four days of crocin glucosides biosynthesis, but decreases after four days. The formation and accumulation of crocin increase during the first six days and stabilized on the eighth day.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "567", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "572", "date_publication": "Oct. 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "567 - 572"}, "authors": ["Yang Bo", "Guo Zhigang", "Liu Ruizhi"], "keywords": ["Biochemistry", "Biomedical monitoring", "Methanol", "Monitoring", "Solids", "Sugar", "Suspensions", "crocetin", "crocetin di-neapolitanosyl ester", "glucosyltransferase", "glycosylation", "saffron", ""], "arnumber": "6075825"}
