The drift-flux model is solved with the one-dimensional continuity equation for gas-liquid two-phase flows as an initial-boundary value problem solved using the characteristic-curve method. The numerical results give the void fraction distribution propagation in a gas-liquid two-phase flow which shows how the flow pattern transition occurs. The numerical simulations of different flow patterns show that the void fraction distribution propagation is determined by the characteristics of the drift-flux between the liquid and gas flows and the void fraction range. Flow pattern transitions begin around a void fraction of 0.27 and end around 0.58. Flow pattern transitions do not occur for very high void concentrations.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "398", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "403", "date_publication": "June 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "398 - 403"}, "authors": ["Jianhui Yang", "Qing Li", "Wenqiang Lu"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Electron tubes", "Indexes", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Numerical simulation", "Physics", "flow pattern transition", "gas-liquid two-phase flow", "void fraction distribution", ""], "arnumber": "6076053"}
