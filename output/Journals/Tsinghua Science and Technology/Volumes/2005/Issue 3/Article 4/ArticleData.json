The PIE model was applied to simulate failures in the simulation-based experiment. Based on syntax and semantic level fault injections, a hybrid fault injection model is presented. To analyze the injected faults, the difficulty to inject (DTI) and difficulty to detect (DTD) are introduced and are measured from the programs used in the code-based experiment. Three interesting results were obtained from the experiments: 1) Failures simulated by the PIE model without consideration of the program and testing features are unreliably predicted; 2) There is no obvious correlation between the DTI and DTD parameters; 3) The DTD for syntax level faults changes in a different pattern to that for semantic level faults when the DTI increases. The results show that the parameters have a strong effect on the failures simulated, and the measurement of DTD is not strict.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "298", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "303", "date_publication": "June 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "298 - 303"}, "authors": ["Ji Wu", "Xiaoxia Jia", "Chang Liu", "Haiyan Yang", "Chao Liu"], "keywords": ["Data models", "Diffusion tensor imaging", "Predictive models", "Semantics", "Software", "Syntactics", "Testing", "failure simulation", "fault injection", "software engineering", "software testing", ""], "arnumber": "6076037"}
