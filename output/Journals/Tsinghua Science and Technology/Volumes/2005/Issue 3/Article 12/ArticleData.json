The analysis of wind loads on large span roof structures (LSRS) requires large amounts of calculations. Due to the combined effects of horizontal and vertical winds, the wind-induced vibrations of LSRS are analyzed in this paper with the frequency domain method as the first application of method for the analysis of the wind response of LSRS. A program is developed to analyze the wind-induced vibrations due to a combination of wind vibration modes. The program, which predicts the wind vibration coefficient and the wind pressure acting on the LSRS, interfaces with other finite element software to facilitate analysis of wind loads in the design of LSRS. The effectiveness and accuracy of the frequency domain method have been verified by numerical analyses of practical projects.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "354", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "358", "date_publication": "June 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "354 - 358"}, "authors": ["Enuo Zhang", "Weiguo Yang", "Wei Zhen", "Xiangqian Na"], "keywords": ["Damping", "Educational institutions", "Fluctuations", "Frequency domain analysis", "Shape", "Software", "Vibrations", "frequency domain analysis", "large", "span roof structures (LSRS)", "vertical wind", "vibration modes", "wind vibration coefficient", ""], "arnumber": "6076045"}
