Several important details, such as the choice of the sample points, of the parameterization, and of the termination condition, are however not well described. These details have a great influence on the performance of the approximation algorithm, both in terms of quality as well as time and space usage. This paper described how to sample points, examining two standard parameterizations: equidistant and chordal. A new and local parameterization, namely an adaptive equidistant model, was proposed, which enhances the equidistant model. Localization can also be used to enhance the chordal parameterization. For NURBS surfaces, one must choose which direction will be approximated first and must pay special attention to surfaces of degree 1 which have to be handled as a special case.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "316", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "322", "date_publication": "June 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "316 - 322"}, "authors": ["Aziguli Wulamu", "Marc Goetting", "Dirk Zeckzer"], "keywords": ["Approximation algorithms", "Approximation methods", "Design automation", "Polynomials", "Spline", "Surface reconstruction", "Surface topography", "NURBS curves", "NURBS surfaces", "approximation", "computer graphics", "computer-aided design (CAD)", "computer-aided geometric design (CAGD)", "implementation", ""], "arnumber": "6076040"}
