The flow in a coaxial thermosyphon was studied experimentally for a variety of heating rates, transfer tube lengths, charge capacities, and area ratios. A numerical analysis of the hydraulic balance between the driving pressure head and the resistance loss has also been performed. The results show that the presented coaxial thermosyphon has dynamic performance advantages relative to natural circulation in a boiling water reactor.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "391", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "397", "date_publication": "June 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "391 - 397"}, "authors": ["Jianhui Yang", "Wenqiang Lu", "Qing Li", "Qiang Li", "Yuan Zhou"], "keywords": ["Electron tubes", "Heat transfer", "Oscillators", "Resistance", "Thermal stability", "Water heating", "coaxial thermosyphon", "thermal hydraulic stability", "two-phase flow", ""], "arnumber": "6076052"}
