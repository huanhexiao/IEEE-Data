The traditional k-means algorithm is, however, inefficient while working on large numbers of data sets and improving the algorithm efficiency remains a problem. This paper focuses on the efficiency issues of cluster algorithms. A refined initial cluster centers method is designed to reduce the number of iterative procedures in the algorithm. A parallel k-means algorithm is also studied for the problem of the operation limitation of a single processor machine when given huge data sets. The analytical results demonstrate that these improvements can greatly enhance the efficiency of the k-means algorithm, i.e., allow the grouping of a large number of data sets more accurately and more quickly. The analysis has theoretical and practical importance for work on the improvement and parallelism of cluster algorithms.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "277", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "281", "date_publication": "June 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "277 - 281"}, "authors": ["Jinlan Tian", "Lin Zhu", "Suqin Zhang", "Lu Liu"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Approximation algorithms", "Clustering algorithms", "Computational complexity", "Data mining", "Parallel processing", "cluster analysis", "data mining", "k-means algorithm", "parallelism", ""], "arnumber": "6076034"}
