Interesting transformations between the average curvature and the Gauss curvature are presented. Various conserved integrals related to the Gauss curvature and the second fundamental tensor are disclosed. The important applications of the results in disciplines such as the geometry, physics, mechanics, and biology are briefly discussed.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "376", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "380", "date_publication": "June 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "376 - 380"}, "authors": ["Yajun Yin"], "keywords": ["Biomembranes", "Equations", "Integral equations", "Surface morphology", "Surface topography", "Vectors", "biomembranes", "curved surfaces", "gradient operator", "integral theorem", ""], "arnumber": "6076049"}
