The parallel computing technique was used to increase the computing power. The shallow water equation was discretized to a linear system of equations with a direct parallel generalized minimum residual algorithm (GMRES) used to solve the linear system. Unlike other parallel GMRES methods, the direct GMRES method does not alter the sequential algorithm, but bases the parallelization on basic operations such as the matrix-vector product. The computed results agree well with observed results. The parallel computing technique significantly increases the solution speed for this largescale problem.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "364", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "371", "date_publication": "June 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "364 - 371"}, "authors": ["Chunbo Jiang", "Kai Li", "Ning Liu", "Qinghai Zhang"], "keywords": ["Equations", "Finite element methods", "Libraries", "Linear systems", "Mathematical model", "Program processors", "Sparse matrices", "generalized minimum residual algorithm (GMRES)", "parallel computing", "shallow water equations", ""], "arnumber": "6076047"}
