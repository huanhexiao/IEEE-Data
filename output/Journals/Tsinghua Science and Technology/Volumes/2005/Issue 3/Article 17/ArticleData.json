The working principle, gas exchange and ignition timing control cycles, and structure and operation advantages of the MFPSE are discussed in detail. A prototype where the timing control and geometric parameters are designed with reference to a traditional two-stroke cycle internal combustion engine is fabricated. The successful ignition experiment shows that this new concept engine is feasible and is worthy of further study.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "381", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "386", "date_publication": "June 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "381 - 386"}, "authors": ["Shimin Zhang", "Jinsong Wang", "Zhiping Guo"], "keywords": ["Combustion", "Ignition", "Power generation", "Timing", "Valves", "free-piston engine", "swing output", "two-stroke cycle", ""], "arnumber": "6076050"}
