Test management is needed to control the complexity and the quality of the testing of large software systems. The reporting mechanism is critical for monitoring the testing progress, analyzing test results, and evaluating the test effectiveness for a disciplined testing process throughout the testing lifecycle. This paper presents an XML-based report generation method for large system testing. The service-oriented architecture enables flexible test report generation, presentation, and exchange to facilitate collaboration in a distributed environment. The results show that proper reporting can effectively improve the visibility of the testing process and that this web-based approach is critical to enhance communication among multiple testing groups.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "282", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "287", "date_publication": "June 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "282 - 287"}, "authors": ["Ling Luo", "Xiaoying Bai"], "keywords": ["Computer architecture", "Databases", "Simple object access protocol", "Testing", "XML", "report generation", "software test management", "web services", ""], "arnumber": "6076035"}
