The relationship between an isolated obstacle size and the intervals of vertical- and cross-section in the DSM model is established. The definition and classification of isolated obstacles are proposed, and a method for determining such isolated obstacles in the DSM model is given. The simulation of a typical urban district shows that when the vertical- and cross-section DSM intervals are between 3 m and 25 m, the threat to terrain-following flight at low-altitude is reduced greatly, and the amount of data required by the DSM model for monitoring in real time a flying vehicle is also smaller. Experiments show that the optimal results are for an interval of 12.5 m in the vertical- and cross-sections in the DSM model, with a 1: 10 000 DSM scale grade.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "323", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "327", "date_publication": "June 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "323 - 327"}, "authors": ["Min Zhao", "Xinggang Lin", "Shouyu Sun", "Youzhi Wang"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Buildings", "Data models", "Remote sensing", "Sea surface", "Surface treatment", "Vehicles", "digital surface model", "flight obstacle", "flight vehicle", "surface feature", "terrain-following guidance", ""], "arnumber": "6076041"}
