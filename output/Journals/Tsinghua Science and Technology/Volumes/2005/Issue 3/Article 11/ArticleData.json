If critical variables representing the influence of spatial features are omitted in the models, the residuals and the coefficients estimated usually exhibit some kind of spatial pattern. Hence, exploration of the relationship between the spatial patterns and the spatial features essentially leads to the discovery of omitted variables. The analyses in this paper were based on two exploratory approaches: one on the residual of a global regression model and the other on the geographically weighted regression (GWR) technique. In the GWR model, the regression coefficients are allowed to differ by location so more spatial patterns can be revealed. Comparison of the two approaches shows that they play supplementary roles for the detection of lot-associated variables and area-associated variables.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "344", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "353", "date_publication": "June 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "344 - 353"}, "authors": ["Xiaolu Gao", "Yasushi Asami"], "keywords": ["Adaptation models", "Analytical models", "Bandwidth", "Correlation", "Data models", "Regression analysis", "Roads", "geographically weighted regression (GWR)", "regression model", "residual", "spatial features", "spatial variation", ""], "arnumber": "6076044"}
