However, no current transaction model can provide full transaction support for such long running business processes. This paper proposes a new transaction model, the pessimistic predicate/transform (PP/T) model, which can provide full transaction support for long running business processes. A framework was proposed on the enterprise JavaBeans platform to implement the PP/T model. The framework enables application developers to focus on the business logic, with the underlying platform providing the required transactional semantics. The development and maintenance effort are therefore greatly reduced. Simulations show that the model has a sound concurrency management ability for long running business processes.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "288", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "297", "date_publication": "June 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "288 - 297"}, "authors": ["Jinling Wang", "Beihong Jin", "Jing Li"], "keywords": ["Business", "Computational modeling", "Concurrency control", "Databases", "Semantics", "Solid modeling", "Transforms", "extended transaction model", "long duration transaction", "transaction processing middleware", ""], "arnumber": "6076036"}
