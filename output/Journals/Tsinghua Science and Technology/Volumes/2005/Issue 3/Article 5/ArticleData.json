However, there are many difficulties when developing OpenMP multithreaded programs. Most importantly, the performance of OpenMP programs cannot be guaranteed, which has greatly affected the application of OpenMP. This paper examines several factors that affect the execution performance of OpenMP programs, including loop transformation, scheduling strategy, the number of threads, and nested parallelism. The results show that one of the key reasons for performance degradation is load imbalance, which can be corrected by reasonable use of these key factors to improve the execution performance of OpenMP programs.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "304", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "308", "date_publication": "June 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "304 - 308"}, "authors": ["Jianjiang Li", "Jiwu Shu", "Yongjian Chen", "Dingxing Wang", "Weiming Zheng"], "keywords": ["Degradation", "Dynamic scheduling", "Instruction sets", "Job shop scheduling", "Performance analysis", "Processor scheduling", "OpenMP", "load imbalance", "loop transformation", "nested parallelism", "number of threads", "scheduling strategy", ""], "arnumber": "6076038"}
