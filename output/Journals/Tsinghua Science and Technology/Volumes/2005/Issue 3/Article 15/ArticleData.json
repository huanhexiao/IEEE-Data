Because this operator has widespread potential uses in mechanics, physics, and biology, the operator's general mathematical characteristics should be investigated. This paper explores the integral characteristics of the operator. The second divergence and the differential properties of the operator are used to demonstrate new integral transformations for vector and scalar fields on curved surfaces, such as the second divergence theorem, the second gradient theorem, the second curl theorem, and the second circulation theorem. These new theorems provide a mathematical basis for the use of this operator in many disciplines.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "372", "volume": "10", "lastpage": "375", "date_publication": "June 2005", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2005", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "372 - 375"}, "authors": ["Yajun Yin"], "keywords": ["Biomembranes", "Educational institutions", "Equations", "Nanobioscience", "Shape", "Tensile stress", "Vectors", "biomembranes", "curved surfaces", "gradient operator", "integral theorem", ""], "arnumber": "6076048"}
