In order to clarify the expression mechanism of rd29 A gene, we isolated two cDNA clones that encoded DRE binding proteins (DREB 1 and DREB 2) from cold and drought-treated Arabidopsis plants, using DRE cis-acting element in the promoter region of rd29 A gene and yeast One Hybrid screening method. Experiments showed both DREB 1 and DREB 2 specifically interacted with DRE cis-element. Homologous analysis showed no significant similarity between DREB 1 and DREB 2 in whole deduced ami no acid sequences. However, both DREB 1 and DREB 2 proteins contained a conserved DNA-binding domain (AP2/EREBP domain). Structural analysis of proteins also showed they had a nuclear localization signal (NLS) in their N terminal region and an acidic activation region in their G terminal region. AP2/EREBP domain is composed of 58 anrino acids, which presents in a large family of plant genes encoding DNA binding proteins. We analyzed many plant transcription factors containing conserved AP2/EREBP domains. The 14th valine (V) and 19th glutamate (E) in the amino acid sequence of AP2/EREBP domains might be the consensus recognizing and binding to DRE cis-element. Northern analysis indicated that DREB 1 gene was induced by low temperature, whereas DREB 2 gene was induced by dehydration and high salt stresses. Present studies suggest that the expression of rd29 A gene under low temperature, dehydration and high salt stresses is regulated by DREB 1 and DREB 2 transcriptional factors in two separate signal transduction pathways, respectively.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1551", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1559", "date_publication": "Sept. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1551 - 1559"}, "authors": ["Qiang Liu", "Jin Li", "Guiyou Zhang", "Nanming Zhao", "K.
