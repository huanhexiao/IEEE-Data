The biosensor chip carries a receptor which is used in immunoassay and the chip properties have an important influence on the detecting sensitivity of the biosensor. This paper describes a polystyrene based biosersor chip developed and used as part of a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor. The SPR biosensor has a much higher detecting senstivity than enzyme-linked immunoserbent assay (ELISA).", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1495", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1498", "date_publication": "Sept. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1495 - 1498"}, "authors": ["Jun Yang", "Senfang Sui"], "keywords": ["Biosensors", "Films", "Gold", "Immune system", "Plasmons", "Proteins", "Rabbits", "enzyme-linked immunoserbent assay", "polystyrene", "surface plasmon resonance biosensor", "surface plasmon resonance microscopy", ""], "arnumber": "6077157"}
