Direct assays for peroxidases and \u03b2-1,3-glucanases demonstrated that the activities of the two enzymes in the rice seedlings increased rapidly with time after SA treatment, reaching a maximum 6 days after treatment. Disease resistance tests showed that SA treated rice seedlings stunted the development of blight lesions and displayed higher resistance to rice blight pathogen (Xanthomonas oryzea pv. oryzea). The data suggest that the treatment with SA even for plants with high endogenous SA levels such as rice, may induce the appearance of new proteins and the formation of disease resistance. The results contribute to the analysis of the SA role in rice systemic acquired resistance.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1519", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1523", "date_publication": "Sept. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1519 - 1523"}, "authors": ["Songhai Shi", "Mingxiang Pan", "Tun Lu", "Haoming Chen", "Mei Zhu", "Jinyuan Liu"], "keywords": ["Immune system", "Lesions", "Pathogens", "Proteins", "Resistance", "induced protein", "rice", "salicylic acid (SA)", "systemic acquired resistance (SAR)", ""], "arnumber": "6077162"}
