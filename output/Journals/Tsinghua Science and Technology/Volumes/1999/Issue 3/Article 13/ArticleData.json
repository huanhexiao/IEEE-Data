The hydroxyalkanoate (HA.) monomer composition varied both quantitatively and qualitatively, depending on the carbon sources used. The presence of octanoate in substrates of myristic acid or tridecanoate promoted the synthesis of HB monomer in the blend. Concentration of octanoate was also found to significantly affect the PHB content in the blend. A PHA biosynthesis pathway in Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligens M1\u20132 was proposed.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1539", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1543", "date_publication": "Sept. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1539 - 1543"}, "authors": ["Qiong Wu", "Chang Zhang", "Weidong Tian", "Suqin Sun", "Riqing Zhang", "Guoqiang Chen"], "keywords": ["Carbon", "Media", "Microorganisms", "Nuclear magnetic resonance", "Strain", "Substrates", "Temperature measurement", "PHA", "PHB", "Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes", "polyhydroxyalkanoate", "polyhydroxybutyrate", ""], "arnumber": "6077167"}
