The effect of PC on the steady state fluorescence of chlorophyll (Chl) in PSII particles was studied. The results show that PC significantly affected the fluorescence intensity, but did not obviously affect the fluorescence emission band peak position. PC also did not obviously affect the absorbence at 436 nm or the amide I band peak position in FF IR spectroscopy of PSII particles The results suggest that PC may affect the light energy transfer from the antenna chlorophyll molecules to the reaction center chlorophyll molecule (P680).", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1505", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1508", "date_publication": "Sept. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1505 - 1508"}, "authors": ["Xiang Ruan", "Qiang Xu", "Jushuo Wang", "Yandao Gong", "Xiufang Zhang", "Liangbi Li", "Tingyun Kuang", "Nanming Zhao"], "keywords": ["Antennas", "Biomembranes", "Energy exchange", "Fluorescence", "Proteins", "Steady-state", "Suspensions", "chlorophyll", "phosphatidylcholine", "photosystem II", "steady state fluorescence", ""], "arnumber": "6077159"}
