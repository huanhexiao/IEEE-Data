This paper investigates the feasibility of using chitosan conduits for peripheral nerve regeneration. Cell culture experiments were used to test the material's cytotoxicity and affinity to nerve cells. Conduit implantation experiments were used to study the degradation of the material and the regeneration of injured sciatic nerves. The primary results indicate that chitosan has good mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and biodegradability and it may be a promising biomaterial for peripheral nerve regeneration.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1515", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1518", "date_publication": "Sept. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1515 - 1518"}, "authors": ["Jianchun Li", "Yinghui Zhong", "Yandao Gong", "Nanming Zhao", "Xiufang Zhang"], "keywords": ["Ethanol", "Materials", "Mice", "Microscopy", "Nerve fibers", "Surface morphology", "biodegradability", "chitosan", "nerve affinity", "nerve conduit", "nerve regeneration", ""], "arnumber": "6077161"}
