However, the primary function of boron remains a matter of discussion. Boron may function by forming complexes with compounds having cis-hydroxyl groups (diols), e.g., pectic materials in cell walls, glycoproteins or glycolipids in membranes and o-diphenols The well-defined functions of boron are its involvement in maintaining cell wall structure and both the structural and the functional integrity of plasma membrane. Lack of boron causes an increase in the leakage of ions and compounds which reflects the impairment of plasma membrane. Boron is functionally important in forming a pectic network in cell wall which is responsible for the extensibility of cell wall and consequently regulates cell growth.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1583", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1586", "date_publication": "Sept. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1583 - 1586"}, "authors": ["Xiaodong Yang", "Yiqin Li"], "keywords": ["Biomembranes", "Boron", "Computer architecture", "Electron tubes", "Microprocessors", "Plasmas", "Proteins", "boron", "growth regulation", "plant cell", ""], "arnumber": "6077176"}
