In this investigation, three kinds of biomaterials derived from chitosan were prepared. The surface wettability of these polymers, interaction of protein with material surface, and their effects on cell adhesion and growth were studied. The results show that the surface contact angle and surface charge of biomaterials have a close bearing on protein adsoiption as well as cell adhesion and growth, indicating that through different chemical modifications, chitosan can be made into different kinds of biomedical materials to satisfy various needs.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1578", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1582", "date_publication": "Sept. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1578 - 1582"}, "authors": ["Yangling Mu", "Guofu Li", "Xiang Ruan", "Yandao Gong", "Nanming Zhao", "Xiufang Zhang"], "keywords": ["Adhesives", "Biomembranes", "Plastics", "Proteins", "Surface morphology", "Three dimensional displays", "biomaterial", "cell culture", "chitosan", "contact angle", "protein adsorption", ""], "arnumber": "6077175"}
