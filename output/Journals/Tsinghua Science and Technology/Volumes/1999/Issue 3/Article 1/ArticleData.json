Light caused the destruction of chlorophyll a and excitonic inter action of chlorophyll a in CP47, whi Ie the protein secondary structure was not apparently changed. Heat induced the destruction of protein secondary structure and exci tonic interaction of chlorophyll a, but the chiorophyll a molecule was not damaged. The results suggest that both the chlorophyll a molecular structure and the protein native conformation are necessary for excitonic interaction of chlorophyll a and the energy transfer function of the chlorophyll a binding protein.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1485", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1488", "date_publication": "Sept. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1485 - 1488"}, "authors": ["Jushuo Wang", "Jixiu Shan", "Qiang Xu", "Yandao Gong", "Tirgyun Kuang", "Nanming Zhao"], "keywords": ["Absorption", "Antennas", "Energy exchange", "Heat treatment", "Heating", "Lighting", "Proteins", "CP47", "circular dichroism", "core antenna", "photosystem II", ""], "arnumber": "6077155"}
