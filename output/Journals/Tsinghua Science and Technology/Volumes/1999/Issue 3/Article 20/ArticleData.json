The strain synthesized PHAs containing monomers of hydroxybutyrate (HB or C4) and/or hydroxyoctancate (HO or C8) and/or hydroxydecancate (HD or C1O) when grown in various substrates including glucose, raw sugar, molasses and various fatty acids. It was found that growth temperature affected the HB and HO monomer contents in the PHA. HB content in PHA increased from mole fraction 69% at 26\u00b0C to mole fraction 85% at 37\u00b0C while HO content decreased from mole fraction 29% at 26\u00b0C to mole fraction 12% at 37\u00b0C. The temperature effect provides a simple and effective way to control the PHA composition and hence control the PHA mechanical and other physical properties. Also, the fermentor experiment indicated that PhB formation was growth associated and HO monomer production was in fact promoted by N-limitation. This conclusion was further supported by the fact that the formation of PHB only polyester was observed only when C/N molar ratio was smaller than 20. Hgher C/N ratio led to the formation of HO monomers in the polyesters.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1574", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1577", "date_publication": "Sept. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1574 - 1577"}, "authors": ["Kui Hong", "Jun Yao", "Kai Zhao", "Guang Zhang", "Riqing Zhang", "Guoqiang Chen"], "keywords": ["Carbon", "Degradation", "Microorganisms", "Strain", "Substrates", "Sugar", "PHA", "PHB", "Pseudomonas", "polyhydroxyalkanote", ""], "arnumber": "6077174"}
