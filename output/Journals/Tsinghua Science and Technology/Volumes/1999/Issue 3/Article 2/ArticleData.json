However, limted information is available on their cytocompatibilities. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of different phospholipids on the proliferation of hepatic Bel 7402 cells by comparing the adhesion, viability and proliferation of Bel-7402 cells cultured on different phospholipic surfaces. The cell adhesion, detemined by counting the number of adhered cells to the surface, indicated that the cell adhesion was enhanced on charged phospolipid membranes. The cell viability evaluated by MIT[3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole 2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazoliun bromide] showed that cells cultured on charged phospholipids have greater viability than those cultured on the control, while cells cultured on neutral phospholipids showed lower viability. The cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry demonstrated that S phase entry increased on charged phospholipids, while S phase entry decreased on neutral phospholipids, The results suggested that charged phospholipids, especially postively charged phospholipids, show better cytocompatibilities than neutral phospholipids to hepatic Bel-7402 cell.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1489", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1494", "date_publication": "Sept. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1489 - 1494"}, "authors": ["Min Dong", "Yanzhu Liu", "Yandao Gong", "Xiufang Zhang", "Nanming Zhao"], "keywords": ["Adhesives", "DNA", "Films", "Lipidomics", "Proteins", "Surface morphology", "Surface treatment", "Bel-7402 cell", "MTT", "cell proliferation", "flow cytometry", "phospholipid", ""], "arnumber": "6077156"}
