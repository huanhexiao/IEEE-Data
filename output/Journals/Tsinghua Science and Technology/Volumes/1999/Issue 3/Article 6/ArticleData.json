Both fluorolabeling and radiolabeling may affect its properties and functions. Therefore, the immunoassay of Arbutin was studied. Arbutin was coupled to bovine serum albumin to get the Arbutin BSA conjugate with high molar ratio of Arbutin to BSA. Two rabbits were injected with the conjugate to develop the anti-Arbutin serum. Ammonium Sulfate precipitation and affinity chromatography were used to purify the anti body. Double agar diffusion tea and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELI SA) were adopted to identify the antibody titer. The results demonstrated that the purity and activi ty of the antibody are high. The method proposed is satisfactory for the immunological detection of Arbutin.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1509", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1514", "date_publication": "Sept. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1509 - 1514"}, "authors": ["Min Dong", "Guofo Li", "Jin Li", "Fei Zhou", "Yandao Gong", "Xiufang Zhang", "Nanming Zhao"], "keywords": ["Immune system", "Impurities", "Production", "Proteins", "Purification", "Rabbits", "Sensitivity", "Arbutin", "ELISA", "affinity chromatography", "bovine serum albumin", "hapten", "immunological detection", ""], "arnumber": "6077160"}
