Enzyme linked lmmunosorbent assay (ELISA) and SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) were used to identify purified IgM antibody. In flow cytometry analysis, the purified IgM antibody recognizes human breast tumor cell line MCF 7 which expresses Lewis-Y antigen. This work presents a new way for the purification of murine monoclonal IgM anti body.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1532", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1534", "date_publication": "Sept. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "1532 - 1534"}, "authors": ["Tianwei Yu", "Yi Xiao", "Haijun Tian", "Qi Pan", "Yinghua Chen"], "keywords": ["Breast tumors", "Filtration", "Humans", "Mice", "Proteins", "Purification", "IgM", "gel filtration", "ion exchange chromatography", ""], "arnumber": "6077165"}
