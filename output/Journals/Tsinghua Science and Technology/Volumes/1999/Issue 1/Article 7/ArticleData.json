A typical EMIS consists of a group of closely connected functions such as production planning, material management, accounting, quality management, etc. The EMIS exchanges information with the CAD/CAPP system in the design department, and the shop floor controller (SFC) in the manufacturing department, while the global information system (GIS) of MACIP supplies the mechanism for information sharing within the enterprise. This paper introduces the EMIS model for a typical manufacturing enterprise, then analyses the interface of the EMIS with the CAD/CAPP system and the SFC. A technical scheme for integrating the EMIS with the GIS is given. This scheme considers the integration of some MRPI systems in the market, and adopts advanced industrial standards to ensure its flexibility and reusability.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1303", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1306", "date_publication": "March 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "1303 - 1306"}, "authors": ["Jian Chen", "Jingliang Wang", "Beien Shao"], "keywords": ["Computer integrated manufacturing", "Electromagnetic interference", "Manufacturing", "Materials", "Planning", "Production", "Servers", "CIMS integrating platform", "computer integrated manufacturing system (CIMS)", "global information system", "management information system", ""], "arnumber": "6077211"}
