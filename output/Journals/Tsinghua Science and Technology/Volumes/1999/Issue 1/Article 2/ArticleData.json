This paper analyzes the shortcomings of traditional software proqramming methods, introduces the background and development of integration platforms and presents the basic functions and system architecture of computer integrated manufacture computing environment (CCE) IP as well as the integration framework. Computer integrated manufacturing system (CIMS) application IP is defined in relation to the IP requirements for CIMS implementation on within a company. The CIMS application IP is not only a support tool for application software development, but also a support tool for software integration and system operation. Therefore, the behavior or and functions of a CIMS application on IP must also include software integration and system operation. The development trend for CIMS application on IPs is discused in view of software techndogy development trends.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1278", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1281", "date_publication": "March 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "1278 - 1281"}, "authors": ["Yushm Fan", "Cheng Wu"], "keywords": ["Companies", "Computer architecture", "Computer integrated manufacturing", "IP networks", "Operating systems", "Programming", "computer integrated manufacturing system (CIMS)", "distributed environment", "integration platform", "object oriented", ""], "arnumber": "6077206"}
