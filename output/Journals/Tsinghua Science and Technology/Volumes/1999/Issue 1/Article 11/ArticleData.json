Also, the growth of the Internet, the World Wide Web, has introduced new dimensi ons of complexity into the development process. All of these must be dealt with as the application is made workable in a distributed client server environment. This paper outlines the architecture of a communication system for the CIMS application integration platform. The communication system makes possible the request for service across heterogeneous platforms and networks, and provides some common solutions to issues common to CIMS applications.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1320", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1324", "date_publication": "March 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "1320 - 1324"}, "authors": ["Tao Huang", "Xiaobin Wu", "Darhua Shao", "Yuarbin Fu"], "keywords": ["Communication systems", "Computer architecture", "Computer integrated manufacturing", "Computers", "Distributed databases", "Operating systems", "Servers", "client/server", "communication system", "computer integrated manufacturing systems (CIMS)", ""], "arnumber": "6077215"}
