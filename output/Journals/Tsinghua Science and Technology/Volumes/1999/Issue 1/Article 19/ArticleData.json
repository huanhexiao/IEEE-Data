The maximum pressure fluctuation is at there attachment point where the jet trajectory flow over the aerator re attaches to bottom of the channel, and its amplitude is 2\u20133 times Iarger than when there is no aerator. There is a dominant frequency of 1.24 Hz in the model, but the coherence in the frequency domain is not obvious for other frequencies beside the dominant frequency. There is a large vortex at there attachment point behind the aerator but comelation among the measurement points is not obvious in the time domain.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1358", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1362", "date_publication": "March 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "1358 - 1362"}, "authors": ["Mengxi Nie"], "keywords": ["Coherence", "Correlation", "Density measurement", "Fluctuations", "Frequency domain analysis", "Random processes", "autocomelation", "bottom aerator", "coherence function", "cross comelation function", "ergodic process", "pressure fluctuation", ""], "arnumber": "6077223"}
