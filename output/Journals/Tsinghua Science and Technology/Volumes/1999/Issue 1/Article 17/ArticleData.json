The new experimental data of the benchmark problem of the IAEA coordinated research program (CRP-3) on heat transport and afterheat removal for GCRs under accident conditions provided by JAERI are used to calculate nitrogen natural convection in the pressurized vessel and air natural convection in the reactor cavity by using this revised code. Based on analysis, a refined mesh is used to solve the differential equations as to get more detailed and more accurate result. The obtained velocity profiles are consistent with the result of TRIOEF code and the result of Bechtel laboratory. It can be drawn that the revised K-FIX code can be used to solve this kind of problems", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1349", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1352", "date_publication": "March 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "1349 - 1352"}, "authors": ["Xinian Zang", "Bing Huang"], "keywords": ["Benchmark testing", "Cooling", "Equations", "Heat transfer", "Heating", "Inductors", "Mathematical model", "high temperature test reactor", "natural convection", "passive residual heat removal", ""], "arnumber": "6077221"}
