The dynamic candidate generation idea introduced in the dynamic itemset counting (DlC) algorithm broke away from the level wise limitation which could find the large itemsets using fewer passes over the database than level wise algorithms. However, the dynamic approach is very sensitive to the data distribution of the database and it requires a proper interval size. In this paper an optimization technique named adaptive interval configuration (AlC) has been developed to enhance the dynamic approach. The AlC optimization has the following two functions The first is that a homogeneous distribution of large itemsets over intervals can be achieved so that less unnecessary candi dates could be generated and less database scanning passes are guaranteed. The second is that the near optimal interval size could be determined adaptively to produce the best response time. We also developed a candidate pruning technique named virtual partition pruning to reduce the size-2 candidate set and incorporated it into the AlC optimization. Based on the optimization technique, we proposed the efficient AlC algorithm for mining association rules. The algorithms of AlC, DlC and the classic Apriori were implemented on a Sun Ultra Enterpri se 4000 for performance comparison. The results show that the AlC performed much better than both DlC and Apriori, and showed a strong robustness.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1325", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1333", "date_publication": "March 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "1325 - 1333"}, "authors": ["Kan Hu", "David W Cheung", "Shaowei Xia"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Association rules", "Heuristic algorithms", "Itemsets", "Optimization", "adaptive algorithm", "association rules", "data mining", "dynamic process", ""], "arnumber": "6077216"}
