At present the traditional method of project economic assessment as widely used in China isolates the wind farm from the whole power system andignores the influence of reliability on the cost of wind generation; therefore, the evaluation results can not reflect the true economic value of wind power generation. After reviewing the many assessment methods used at home and abroad, this paper uses the Avoided Cost Method as theoretical basis to establish an economic evaluation model for large wind farms including the characteristics of other conventional forms of power generation like thermal power as well as the system load. The generating reliability is also combined into the economic evaluation. The model is used to evaluate China's largest wind farm, Dabancheng Wind Farm in Xinjiang.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1341", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1344", "date_publication": "March 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "1341 - 1344"}, "authors": ["Jie Wei", "Yuan Guo", "Shuhua Gu"], "keywords": ["Economics", "Fuels", "Load modeling", "Reliability", "Wind farms", "Wind power generation", "Wind turbines", "avoided cost", "economic evaluation", "large wind farms", "reliability evaluation", ""], "arnumber": "6077219"}
