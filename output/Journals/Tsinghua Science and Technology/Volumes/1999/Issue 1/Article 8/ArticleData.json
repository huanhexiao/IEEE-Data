The method reduces the original problem to the solution of linear algebraic equations Hence, the computational difficulties are considerably reduced. Since Haar wavelet bases cooperate time frequency localization, the system solution includes both frequency information and time information. Other orthogonal functions do not have this property. An example shows that the result are very accurate.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1307", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1310", "date_publication": "March 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "1307 - 1310"}, "authors": ["Xiangqian Liu", "Lin Zhang"], "keywords": ["Cost function", "Discrete wavelet transforms", "Optimal control", "Time domain analysis", "Time frequency analysis", "Vectors", "Wavelet analysis", "Haar wavelet", "optimal control", "time varying systems", ""], "arnumber": "6077212"}
