CAPP attempts to capture the thoughts and methods of the experienced process planner. Variant systems are understandable, generative systems can plan new parts. Expert systems increase flexibility, fuzzy logic captures vague knowledge while neural networks learn. The combination of fuzzy, neural and expert system technologies is necessary to capture and utilize the process planning logic. A system that maintains the dependability and clarity of variant systems, is capable of planning new parts, and improves itself through learning is needed by industry.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1314", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1319", "date_publication": "March 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "1314 - 1319"}, "authors": ["S.
