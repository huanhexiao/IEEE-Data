Most of them consider the point to point cases, where the rate control problem can often be abstracted as how to allocate bits among frames or among blocks when available bandwidth is limited. While in some other cases, such as some wireless ATM systems, multi users share the common limited bandwidth. In such conditions, the bandwidth allocation among different users becomes a rather important problem. In this paper, a novel bandwidth allocation scheme is presented, where the available bandwidth is dynamically allocated among different users based on a so called\u201d equal distortion\u201d criteri on. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme considerably improves the overall subjective performance in mult user VBR communication systems. It is noticed that the proposed join source and channel rate control idea is a very general concept that can be useful in many similar problems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1334", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1337", "date_publication": "March 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "1334 - 1337"}, "authors": ["Tao Xie", "Ming Zhao", "Yun He", "Jing Wang", "Chongxi Feng"], "keywords": ["Bandwidth", "Channel allocation", "Distortion measurement", "Image quality", "Manganese", "Quantization", "Streaming media", "bandwidth allocation", "rate control", "variable bit rate", ""], "arnumber": "6077217"}
