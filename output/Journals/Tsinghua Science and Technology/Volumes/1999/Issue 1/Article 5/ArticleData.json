This paper analyses five basic features of product data management and combines them with real industrial examples. Then, an object oriented product data management model is presented. To carry out the model, the paper presents the architecture of the CAx information management and integration system (CAx IMIS), and focuses on its core technology, implementation of an object management framework, and discusses the process of realizing the inherent attributes, relations, and messages between objects using the object dictionary and storing detail informntion about the persistent objects in relation database management system (RDBMS). The method provides an effective object management framework for CAx IMIS.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1291", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1296", "date_publication": "March 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "1291 - 1296"}, "authors": ["Heliang Li", "Liping Huang", "Jianming Li", "Bingshu Tong", "Longwen Xu"], "keywords": ["Adaptation models", "Data models", "Dictionaries", "Information management", "Object oriented modeling", "Servers", "Solid modeling", "engineering information management (EIM)", "object management framework (OMF)", "product data management (PDM)", ""], "arnumber": "6077209"}
