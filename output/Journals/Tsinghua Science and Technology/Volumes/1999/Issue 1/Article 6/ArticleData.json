A dynamic scheduling approach based on Lagrangi an relaxation is proposed to improve the quality and guarantee the real time capability of dynamic scheduling. The proposed method makes use of the dynamic predictive optimal theory combined with Lagrangian relaxation to obtain a good solution that can be evaluated quantitatively. The Lagrangian multipliers introduced here are capable of describing machine predictive states and system capacity constraints. This approach can evaluate the suboptimality of the scheduling systems. It can also quickly obtain high quality feasible schedules, thus enabling Lagrangian relaxation to be better used in the dynamic seheduling of manufacturing system. The efficieney and effectiveness of this method are verified by numerical experiments.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1297", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1302", "date_publication": "March 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "1297 - 1302"}, "authors": ["Rui Xiong", "Yushun Fan", "Cheng Wu"], "keywords": ["Dynamic scheduling", "Heuristic algorithms", "Job shop scheduling", "Maintenance engineering", "Optimal scheduling", "Schedules", "Lagrangian relaxation", "dynamic programming", "flexible manufacturing system (FMS)", "job shop scheduling", ""], "arnumber": "6077210"}
