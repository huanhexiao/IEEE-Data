One important aspect in the mechanical analysis of NCs is to determine the gradient distribution that creates the maximumthermal stress relaxation. This paper employs numerical analysis using the fini te element method and experimental analysis using moi re interference to study the stress distributioninNCs. Attention focused on the edge effect stresses in the coating/substrate structures and their dependence on the di fferent gradient distributions of this new kind of composite structure.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1353", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1357", "date_publication": "March 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "1353 - 1357"}, "authors": ["Qianjun Xu", "Shouwen Yu", "Yilan Kang"], "keywords": ["Ceramics", "Coatings", "Finite element methods", "Stress", "Substrates", "Thermal stresses", "finite element method", "gradient distribution", "moire inter ference", "nonhomogeneous coating", ""], "arnumber": "6077222"}
