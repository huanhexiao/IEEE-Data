The method converts the original problem to solving algebraic equations algebraic equations. Hence, computational difficulties fficulties are considerably Based rediced. Based on the property of time frequency localization of Haar wavelet bases, the solution of a system includes both the frequency information and the time information. Other orthogonal functions do not have this property. An example is given, and the results are shown to be very accurate.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1311", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1313", "date_publication": "March 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "1311 - 1313"}, "authors": ["Xiangqian Liu", "Lin Zhang"], "keywords": ["Discrete wavelet transforms", "Equations", "Time domain analysis", "Time frequency analysis", "Time varying systems", "Vectors", "Wavelet analysis", "Haar wavelet", "orthogonal functions", "time varying systems", ""], "arnumber": "6077213"}
