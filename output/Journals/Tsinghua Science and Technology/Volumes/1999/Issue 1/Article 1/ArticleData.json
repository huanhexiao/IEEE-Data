Its objective is to shorten product life cycle, improve product quality and reduce product cost. Modeling the concurrent engineering product development process (CEPDP) is a key part of this process which has attracted the attention of researchers and engineers around the world. This paper focuses on a newly developed and potentially powerful CEPDP modeling philosophy \u2014 integrated multi-view modeling (IMVM), by which managers can foresee the evdution of a product from its conception to its disposal and consider all the important factors in its production before a project is launched. CEPDP/IMVM is a product oriented modeling method. A modeling environment is used to establish a systematic model including di fferent aspects of the process such as product information, development activi ties, enterprise rerources, and organizational structure. The integration within an IMVM model Slould accurately reflect the PDP s dynamic characteristics and provide necessary information for monitoring and coordinating processes.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1271", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1277", "date_publication": "March 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "1271 - 1277"}, "authors": ["Guangleng Xiong", "Liwu Hao", "Yi Peng"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Computational modeling", "Concurrent engineering", "Monitoring", "Organizations", "Process control", "Product development", "concurrent engineering", "integrated multi-view modeling", "product development process", ""], "arnumber": "6077205"}
