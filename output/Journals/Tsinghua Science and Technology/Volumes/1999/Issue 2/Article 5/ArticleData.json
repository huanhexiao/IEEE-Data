A framework is developed for applications of CAD/CAPP/CAM integration based on the STEP to reduce the complexity of integration implementation. Two application program interfaces (API), namely, application protocol API and application API, are developed. The framework's hierarchy structure and the application program interfaces between the layers make the integration of applications easier.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1403", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1406", "date_publication": "June 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "1403 - 1406"}, "authors": ["Bing Li", "Mingchen Meng", "Zhenhong Li", "Bingshu Tong"], "keywords": ["Computer aided manufacturing", "Data models", "Data structures", "Design automation", "Manufacturing", "Protocols", "Semantics", "CAD/CAPP/CAM integration", "application program interface", "feature", "integration framework", "standard for the exchange of product model data", ""], "arnumber": "6077185"}
