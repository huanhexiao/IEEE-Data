For the instance of multi value constraint with continuous variables, the approach will be quite different and the difficulty of settling will aggrandize a lot. This paper presents the algorithm for realizing global consistency of continuous variable. And this algorithm can be applied to multi value constraint.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1392", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1396", "date_publication": "June 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "1392 - 1396"}, "authors": ["Tianqing Chang", "Jingyi Li", "Wensheng Xu", "Guangleng Xiong"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Artificial intelligence", "Educational institutions", "Network topology", "Optimization", "Topology", "Upper bound", "artificial intelligence", "consistency problem", "constraint satisfaction problem", ""], "arnumber": "6077183"}
