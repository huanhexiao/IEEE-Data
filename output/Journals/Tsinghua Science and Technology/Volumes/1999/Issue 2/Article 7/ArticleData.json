The integration technology based on STEP application protocol gives an effective way for the CAx/DFx information integration. This paper discusses the characteristics of concurrent product development, analyzes the methodology and technology of STEP, proposes an information integration approach based on STEP AP214, and presents the strategy of product data integration and an integration system implementation architecture. The integration technology based on STEP application protocol and the ST-Developer tools is realized in a prototype system to support product data integration between CAD and its follow up systems through STEP physical file and STEP information exchange interface.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1412", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1417", "date_publication": "June 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "1412 - 1417"}, "authors": ["Heming Zhang", "Guangleng Xiong", "Yuyun Zhang"], "keywords": ["Computer aided manufacturing", "Concurrent engineering", "Data models", "Design automation", "Manufacturing", "Object oriented modeling", "Solid modeling", "CAD/CAPP/CAM", "Concurrent Engineering (CE)", "STEP", "information integration", ""], "arnumber": "6077187"}
