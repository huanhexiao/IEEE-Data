In TTEG the content of water ranged from 0 to 5% and the test temperature ranged from 20\u00b0C to 120\u00b0C. Increasing the temperature resulted in greater solubility of the aromatics in TTEG, while increasing the content of water caused the aromatic solubility to decrease. The benzene solubillity in TTEG was the greatest followed by toluene and xylene at the same water content and temperature. The mutual solubility was predicted by correlating the paramaters of a new group for the UNIFAC model for the arorratics extraction system The modified UNIFAC group contributi on model was used to predict the binary solubility of TTEG and arorratics The average deviation between the experimental result and prediction is 4.06% Therefore, the UNIFAC model can be used to describe the solubility phenomena for TTEG aromatics systerrs.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1462", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1465", "date_publication": "June 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "1462 - 1465"}, "authors": ["Shenlinq Zhu", "Wen Wang", "Zeming Gou"], "keywords": ["Data models", "Magnetic liquids", "Mathematical model", "Petroleum", "Predictive models", "Solvents", "Temperature measurement", "UNIFAC model", "aromatics extraction", "binary sdubility", "tetraethylene glycol", ""], "arnumber": "6077197"}
