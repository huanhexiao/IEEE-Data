A Chine se style concurrent engineering architecture and reference mode has been produced. A series of break thoughts in BPR (Business Process Reengineering) have been made with organization of the IPT (Integrated Product Development Team) and engineering support technologies. Several prototype tools were developed, including product development process modeling and management, QFD-based schema design and decision making, PDM-based concurrent design, STEP-based CAD/CAPP/CAM integration, design for assembly, design for manufacturing, computer aided fixture design, and machining process simulation. Finally, the research results were used in the devlopment of two complex components in an aerospace application, and satisfactory results were obtained.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1375", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1385", "date_publication": "June 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "1375 - 1385"}, "authors": ["Guangleng Xiong", "Bohu Li", "Jiadong Chen", "Jianming Li", "Yuyun Zhang", "Wenhai Zhu", "Shuqing Bai"], "keywords": ["Computer aided engineering", "Computer aided manufacturing", "Concurrent engineering", "Design automation", "Manufacturing", "Product development", "Solid modeling", "Business process Reengineering(BPR)", "Concurrent Engineering", "machining process simulation", ""], "arnumber": "6077181"}
