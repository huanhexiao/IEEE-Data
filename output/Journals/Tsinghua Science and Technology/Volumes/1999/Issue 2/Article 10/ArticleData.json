After the simulation of casting process of typical magnesium based alloy casting with complicated structure, remarkable success in assuring the quality is also presented.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1431", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1435", "date_publication": "June 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "1431 - 1435"}, "authors": ["Yongbao Li", "Baicheng Liu", "Wei Qiu"], "keywords": ["Casting", "Computational modeling", "Equations", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Numerical simulation", "Solid modeling", "Algebraic Stress Model", "Concurrent Engineering", "casting process", "numerical simulation", ""], "arnumber": "6077190"}
