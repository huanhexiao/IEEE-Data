Compared with the common extractive distillation the performance of solvent is improved, the recycling amount of slovent is reduced to 1/4\u20131/5, and the number of theoretical plates is reduced to 1/3 Energy conamption and cost of equipment are also reduced and continuous production is realized. High efficiency and low solvent wastage rrake this technique feasible.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1477", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1479", "date_publication": "June 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "1477 - 1479"}, "authors": ["Rongqi Zhou", "Zhanting Duan"], "keywords": ["Chemicals", "Data mining", "Ethanol", "Production facilities", "Recycling", "Solvents", "anhydrous ethanol", "extractive distillation", "salt", "solvent", ""], "arnumber": "6077200"}
