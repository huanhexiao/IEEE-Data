Conflicts are pervasive in Concurrent Engineering design environment. Conflict negotiation is necessary when conflicts occur. It is difficult to resolve conflicts due to several reasons. An approach to resolving conflicts by case-based reasoning is proposed in this paper. The knowledge representation of conflict negotiation cases, the judgment of case similarity, the retrieval model of cases, the management of case bases, and the process of case-based conflict negotiation are studied. The implementation structure of the Case based Conflict Solving System (CCSS) is also given.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1397", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1402", "date_publication": "June 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "1397 - 1402"}, "authors": ["Wensheng Xu", "Guangleng Xiong", "Feng Gao", "Xinfang Zhang"], "keywords": ["Cognition", "Concurrent engineering", "Indexing", "Knowledge representation", "Materials", "Solid modeling", "Concurrent Engineering", "case based reasoning", "conflict negotiation", "knowledge representation", ""], "arnumber": "6077184"}
