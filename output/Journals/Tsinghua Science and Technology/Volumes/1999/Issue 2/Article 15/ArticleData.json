P45, rsgp 41 and the complexes were well resolved. The entire separation was achieved in less than 3 min. Formations of two kinds of stable P45-rsgp 41 complexes were confirmed based on migration time comparison; the binding equilibrium was achieved as soon as two proteins were mixed. The results indicate that the interaction between P45 and rsgp 41 is strong with a fast association rate and a slow dissoction rate, and there are at least two kinds of binding sites with different binding constants between P45 and rsgp 41.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1454", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1457", "date_publication": "June 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "1454 - 1457"}, "authors": ["Qinggang Wang", "Guoan Llo", "Weicherg Wu", "Yinghua Chen"], "keywords": ["Absorption", "Biomembranes", "Human immunodeficiency virus", "Humans", "Immune system", "Kinetic theory", "Proteins", "HIV-1 gp 41", "affinity capillary electrophoresis", "membrane protein", ""], "arnumber": "6077195"}
