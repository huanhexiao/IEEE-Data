Based on the analyses of the character of concurrent product design and manufacturing process design, the workflow of DFM/CAPP/CAM system in CE is given. DFM/CAPP/CAM theories, methods and functions are invesigated in a delicate and all-round way, and are implemented in the developed DFM/CAPP/CAM system", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1418", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1423", "date_publication": "June 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "1418 - 1423"}, "authors": ["Chengying Liu", "Xiankui Wang", "Jian Pu", "Zhizhong Li", "Xin'gang Huang", "Xia Zhu"], "keywords": ["Computer aided manufacturing", "Cutting tools", "Design automation", "Machine tools", "Machining", "Manufacturing processes", "Concurrent Engineering (CE)", "design for manufacturing", "process planning", ""], "arnumber": "6077188"}
