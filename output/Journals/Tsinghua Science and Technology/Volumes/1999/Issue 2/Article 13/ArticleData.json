In this paper, the research scope and research methods of the computer-aided fixture planning are presented. Based on positioning principles of typical workparts, an ANN algorithm, namely Hopfield algorithm, is adopted for the antomatic fixture planning. Also, this paper leads a deep research into the selection of positioning and clamping surfaces (or points) on workparts using positioning-clamping-surface-selecting rule and matrix evaluation of deterministic worlpart positioning. In the end of this paper, the methods to select positioning and clamping elements from database and the layout algorithm to assemble the selected fixture elements into a tangible fixture are developed.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1443", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1447", "date_publication": "June 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "1443 - 1447"}, "authors": ["Dong Tang", "Ye Cheng", "Fuzhi Cai", "Quansheng Li"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Clamps", "Databases", "Fixtures", "Planning", "Surface treatment", "Vectors", "deterministic positioning", "fixture planning", "layout algorithm", ""], "arnumber": "6077193"}
