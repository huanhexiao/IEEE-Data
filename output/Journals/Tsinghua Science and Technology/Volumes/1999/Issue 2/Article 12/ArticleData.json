This paper presents a part machinability evaluati on system, discusses the general restrictions of part machinability, and realizes the inspection of these restrictions with the relation between tool scan space and part model. During the system development, the expansibility and understandability were considered, and an independent restriction algorithm library and a general function library were set up. Additionally, the system has an interpreter and a knowledge manager.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1440", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1442", "date_publication": "June 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "1440 - 1442"}, "authors": ["Xin'gang Huang", "Xiankui Wang", "Chengying Liu", "Jian Pu"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Concurrent engineering", "Educational institutions", "Heuristic algorithms", "Libraries", "Machining", "Manufacturing", "Concurrent Engineering (CE)", "design for manufacturing", "machinability evaluation", ""], "arnumber": "6077192"}
