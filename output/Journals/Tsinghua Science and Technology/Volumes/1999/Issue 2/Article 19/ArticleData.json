Oultured in Luria Bertani (LB) medium with 20g/Lglucose, E. coli JM109 (pTu9) could accumulate PHB in cells up to 40% (g PHB per g dry cells). Achelating agent EDTA was applied to induce a corrplete cell lysis and PHB granules were released. This method has a potential application in PHB separation.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1472", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1476", "date_publication": "June 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "1472 - 1476"}, "authors": ["Jin Yin", "Vi Xu", "Hongqi Li", "Peijin Zhou", "Zhongyao Shen"], "keywords": ["Biomembranes", "Cells (biology)", "DNA", "Laboratories", "Microorganisms", "Seals", "Sugar", "cell disruption", "lambda (&#x03BB", ") phage", "lysis gene", "poly-&#x003B", "2-hydroxybutyrate (PHB)", ""], "arnumber": "6077199"}
