Besides a one point neutron kinetics equation and terrperature feedback based on the lumped fuel and coolant terrperature, which are the usual methods used in modeling of PWR, two other factors are also considered in order to suit the wide range operation. The first consideration is the natural circulation in the primary loop because it affects the heat transfer coefficients in the core and in the primary heat exchanger (PHE). The second consderation is the flow rate variation in the secondary loop which leads to some nonlinear properties. The simulation results show that the model is accurate enough for control system simulation. Some model reduction basis can be obtained through the dynamic analysis", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1661", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1665", "date_publication": "Dec. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "1661 - 1665"}, "authors": ["Yuai Zhang", "Longzhi Liu", "Changwen Ma"], "keywords": ["Coolants", "Electron tubes", "Inductors", "Load modeling", "Mathematical model", "Neutrons", "Nuclear Heating Plant", "dynamic analysis", "natural circulation", "nonlinear dynamic model", ""], "arnumber": "6079211"}
