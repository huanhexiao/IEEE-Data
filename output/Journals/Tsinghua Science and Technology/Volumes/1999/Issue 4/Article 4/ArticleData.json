Fuzzy technique is used to implerrent the AVSG for eliminating chattering, and then a new guidance method called fuzzy AVSG is produced. The fuzzy AVSG is applied to the space interception problem Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the new gui dance method.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1610", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1614", "date_publication": "Dec. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "1610 - 1614"}, "authors": ["Di Zhou", "Chundi Mu", "Werli Xu"], "keywords": ["Adaptive systems", "Azimuth", "Mathematical model", "Missiles", "Navigation", "Pragmatics", "Robustness", "adaptive variable structure guidance", "fuzzy technique", "space interception", ""], "arnumber": "6079200"}
