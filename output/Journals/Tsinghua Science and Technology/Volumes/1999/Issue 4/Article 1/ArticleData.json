In this paper a novel solution on to this problem is given by use of a \u201cstrong tracking fiIter (STF)\u201d. First, the STF is outlined, then some technical points of view to use the STF as an adaptive observer are discussed. Finally, two typical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1597", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1601", "date_publication": "Dec. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "1597 - 1601"}, "authors": ["Donghua Zhou", "Yihu Jin"], "keywords": ["Adaptation models", "Adaptive systems", "Control systems", "Mathematical model", "Nonlinear systems", "Observers", "Time varying systems", "adaptive observer", "nonlinear system", "strong tracking filter", "time varying system", ""], "arnumber": "6079197"}
