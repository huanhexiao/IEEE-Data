The main purpose of calculating the electrostatic field is to investigate the effect of electrostatic shiel ding in transformers and to see if the shielding can be removed. The conclusions are that the shielding on the middle of the winding is not clearly profitable to the maximum electrostatic field strength and can be removed. To calculate the field a 3-D finite element software has been developed which is based on a powerful tetrahedral mesh generator. Meanwhile, axisymmetric models are also employed to simulate the effect of the shielding.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1698", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1700", "date_publication": "Dec. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "1698 - 1700"}, "authors": ["Liping Zhang", "Yuan Jiansheng", "Li Zhongxin"], "keywords": ["Adaptation models", "Electric fields", "Electrostatics", "Finite element methods", "Software", "Solid modeling", "Voltage transformers", "finite element method", "potential transformer (PT)", "three dimensional (3-D) electrostatic field", ""], "arnumber": "6079219"}
