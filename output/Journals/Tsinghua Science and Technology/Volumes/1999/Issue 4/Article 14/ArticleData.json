In order to increase the thermal efficiency of the existing heating reactor, an electro-heat cogeneration plant concept is presented. The cogeneration plant keeps the advantages of the existing heating reactor: compact arrangement (smaller sizes than ordinary facility), simpler systems, good safety, and makes some improvements. For example, introduce boiling in the reactor, the cogeneration plant can be used for ship propulsion, movable desalination on plant, and process heating plant. Several variants have been analyzed from the view point of thermodynamics. Main features and parameters of the plant are given in the paper.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1656", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1660", "date_publication": "Dec. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "1656 - 1660"}, "authors": ["Changwen Ma"], "keywords": ["Cogeneration", "Desalination", "Inductors", "Marine vehicles", "Ocean temperature", "Propulsion", "boiling reactor", "desalination", "heating reactor", "propulsion", ""], "arnumber": "6079210"}
