Stress, strain, and ultimate strength of the laminate are analyzed. Comparison between calculated result and test data shows that the nonlinear approach gives more accurate result, especially for orthotropic I am nate. Pararretric study shows that the variation of nonlinear factor has more effect on the result for orthotropic plate than for quasi-isotropic plate.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1628", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1631", "date_publication": "Dec. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "1628 - 1631"}, "authors": ["Chengdong Xu", "Hui Zhang", "Jiaguang Sun", "Li Zhengneng"], "keywords": ["Composite materials", "Finite element methods", "Laminates", "Loading", "Strain", "Stress", "composite laminte", "damage", "finite element", "nonlinear", ""], "arnumber": "6079204"}
