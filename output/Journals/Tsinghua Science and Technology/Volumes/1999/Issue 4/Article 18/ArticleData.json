It is important to understand its internal flow field in order to design higher efficiency and pressure ratio impellers. In this paper, a 3-D viscous code to solve the simplified Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes equations has been developed. The viscocs effect is simulated by viscous body force method. The governing equations are spatially discretized in the celt vortex finite volume scheme on a simple H mesh. The turbulence closure is made using the Baldwin Lomax model. This code is demonstrated for predicting the internal flow field of a high speed impeller. Some laser measured results are also illustrated for comparing with calculated data.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1678", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1682", "date_publication": "Dec. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "1678 - 1682"}, "authors": ["Ce Yang", "Zhigang Li", "Zikang Jiang", "Yisheng Suo"], "keywords": ["Blades", "Equations", "Force", "Impellers", "Integral equations", "Mathematical model", "Velocity measurement", "3-D flow field", "centrifugal compressor", "multigrid", "power machinery", "viscous body force", ""], "arnumber": "6079214"}
