In this paper the evolution of plasma sheath above the anode was recorded with a laser differential interferometer and the metallic vapor produced on the target surface by bombardment of an intense electron beam was observed for the first time. The results can help understanding of the physical process of the X-ray emission from plasma focus.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1695", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1697", "date_publication": "Dec. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "1695 - 1697"}, "authors": ["Xinxin Wang", "Jinji Yang"], "keywords": ["Anodes", "Cathodes", "Electron beams", "Filling", "Plasma sheaths", "Presses", "X-ray emission", "interferogram", "plasma focus", ""], "arnumber": "6079218"}
