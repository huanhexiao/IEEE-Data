In this code, H meshes are adopted to build the discrete equations, and the conservation equations are solved on grid nodes at the corners of cuboid elements. In order to acceler ate convergence, local time stepping, residual smoothing and multigrid method are also applied, and the viscous effects are approximated by a very simple mixing length model. For verification of the accuracy and applicability of the method, transonic flows through compressor cascades of NASA rotor 37 and flows through a turbine stator of NASA have been calculated. The good agreement between experimental results and design data has demonstrated the reliability and applicability of the present method, which can be used for simulating the complex 3-D viscous flow phenomenon in turbomachinery.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1672", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1677", "date_publication": "Dec. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "1672 - 1677"}, "authors": ["Wei Zhu", "Ce Yang", "Zikang Jiang", "Yisheng Suo"], "keywords": ["Blades", "Compressors", "Equations", "Mathematical model", "Rotors", "Shock waves", "Surface waves", "finite volume", "multigrid", "time marching method", "turbomachinery", "turbulence model", ""], "arnumber": "6079213"}
