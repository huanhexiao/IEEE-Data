Looking forward, the simulators will again prove their value far beyond the traditional training applications Simulators will serve as the engine of the envisioned \u201cTotal Plant Solution Sysem\u201d, which will provide optimized solutions to every aspect of the plant operation including on line plant monitoring, control, diagroaics, automation, optimization, as well as simulation and analysis. Simulators will greatly enhance operational reliability, availability, efficiency, and safety.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1683", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1687", "date_publication": "Dec. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "1683 - 1687"}, "authors": ["Maoqing Xie", "Tingjin Ren", "Dezhong Yan", "Jingrong Guo", "Zen Wang", "C.
