Advanced parallel processing channels, consisting of a microprocessor based unit and a General Array Logic (GAL)-based unit have been configured in each of the redundant trains to eliminate the risk of common mode failure of digital RPSs through the way of diversified equipment. Also several digital techniques are also applied to improve the system design. For example, the Voltage/Frequency (V/F) converter is applied to achieve the digitization of the measurement channel. GAL components greatly simplify the hardware ci rcuit design. Two types of communication buses are designed to improve the reliability of data transmission. By all these means, the reliability of RPS can be expected to achieve a great improvement.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1652", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1655", "date_publication": "Dec. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "1652 - 1655"}, "authors": ["Mingde Shi", "Duo Li", "Changwen Ma", "Zhengguo Xie"], "keywords": ["Frequency conversion", "Frequency measurement", "Inductors", "Parallel processing", "Reliability", "Software", "Voltage measurement", "digital reactor protection system", "nuclear heating reactor", "parallel processing", "reliability", ""], "arnumber": "6079209"}
