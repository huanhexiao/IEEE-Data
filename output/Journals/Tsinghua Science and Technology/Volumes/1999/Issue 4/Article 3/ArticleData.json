This paper gives a brief survey of Group Decision Support Systems (GDSS). Then the influence of Intranet on GDSS and limitations of Intranet as a platform for GDSS are analyzed. A new framework for Intranet based GDSS is proposed, which extends the two tier browser/server architecture to multilevel distributed application architecture. A broker level and a middle application level are added, with a GDSS interface embedded in the web browser. The coterminous two levels in the new framework still comply wi th the tradi tional client/server architecture. This framework for Intranet based GDSS is called as extended GDSS (xGDSS, in short). Features of xGDSS include cost effective, short development cycle, open, flexible configuration, general-purpose, etc.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "1606", "volume": "4", "lastpage": "1609", "date_publication": "Dec. 1999", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1999", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "1606 - 1609"}, "authors": ["Yue Zhuo", "Hong Wang", "Qiufeng Wu", "Sharnjun Zhu"], "keywords": ["Browsers", "Computer architecture", "Databases", "Decision making", "Decision support systems", "Information systems", "Servers", "Intranet", "framework", "group decision support system", ""], "arnumber": "6079199"}
