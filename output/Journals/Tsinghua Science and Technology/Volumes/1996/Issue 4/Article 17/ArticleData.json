Two calix[4] arene-porphyrin derivatives were synthesized as models of cytochrome p-450 monooxygenase. The conformations of the models were determined using DQFCOSY (double quantum filter correlation spectroscopy), NOESY (nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy), etc. The calix[4] arene part showed cone conformation in the compound 1 and showed mainly partial cone conformation in the compound 2. The calix[4] arene and the porphyrin were situated side by side in the compound 1, and above and below each other in the compound 2.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "395", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "398", "date_publication": "Dec. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "395 - 398"}, "authors": ["Ning Yongcheng", "Yuan Lihua", "Wang Fengyan", "Yuan Haodan", "Chen Shuhua", "Zhao Huaming", "Feng Yuping", "Mao Yingqun"], "keywords": ["Biochemistry", "Biological system modeling", "Bridges", "Nuclear magnetic resonance", "Organic compounds", "2D NMR", "calixarene", "conformation", "enzyme model", "porphyrin", ""], "arnumber": "6077777"}
