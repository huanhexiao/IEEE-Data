Parameters which influence CIA separation such as the addition of an electroosmotic flow modifier, choice of electrolyte anions and the buffer'S pH are investigated. In the optimized system, selenate and slenite are separated in a buffer containing chromate, triethanolamine, and tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide at pH 9.2. There is sufficient resolution to allow accurate quantification. 10 mg/L bromide is used as internal standard. Quantification is highly reproducible with a migration time RSD of 0.89% over 6 runs and a peak area RSD of 1.23%. The method is linear over two orders of magnitude. The detection limits of lower than 0.5 mg/L are attainable when the pressure injection (3.5 kPa) time is 10s. The selenite recovery (101%) is acceptable.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "425", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "428", "date_publication": "Dec. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "425 - 428"}, "authors": ["Hu Ping", "Luo Guoan", "Wang Ruji", "Tang Chiachun"], "keywords": ["Active matrix organic light emitting diodes", "Carbon", "Detectors", "Drugs", "Hydrodynamics", "Integrated circuits", "USA Councils", "capillary electrophoresis", "inorganic selenium", "ion analysis", "kappa-selenocar-rageenan", "valence analysis", ""], "arnumber": "6077783"}
