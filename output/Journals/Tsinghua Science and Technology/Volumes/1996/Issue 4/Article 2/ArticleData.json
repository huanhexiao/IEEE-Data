Numerical simulation is carried out using PHOENICS computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. Results of the numerical simulation are in fairly good agreement with experimental results. The results obtained in this study are useful for further investigation of fluid behaviour inside an RDC extraction column and for equipment design.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "323", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "326", "date_publication": "Dec. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "323 - 326"}, "authors": ["Wang Yundong", "Fei Weiyang", "Dai Youyuan", "Wang Jiading"], "keywords": ["Computational fluid dynamics", "Measurement by laser beam", "Numerical simulation", "Particle measurements", "Rotation measurement", "Shafts", "Velocity measurement", "axial mixing", "computational fluid dynamics", "rotating disc contactor", ""], "arnumber": "6077762"}
