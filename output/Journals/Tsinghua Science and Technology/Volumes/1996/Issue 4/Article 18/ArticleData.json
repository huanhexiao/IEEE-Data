The densities for 22 single-, 9 binary- and 1 quaternary-electrolyte aqueous solutions at different temperatures were calculated using water parameters and ionic diameters. Also, the densities of NaCl solution at 25 300 and 0.1 100 MPa were calculated. The calculation precision was good. The results show that this equation of state is suitable for calculating densities of single and mixed electrolyte solutions in wide ranges of temperatures and pressures. No empirical parameter is needed when this equation is used for high temperatures and high pressures or for mixed electrolyte solutions.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "399", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "405", "date_publication": "Dec. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "399 - 405"}, "authors": ["Lu Jiufang", "Li Chunxi", "Li Yigui"], "keywords": ["Correlation", "Dispersion", "Equations", "Ions", "Mathematical model", "Temperature distribution", "aqueous electrolyte", "density", "equation of state", "perturbation theory", ""], "arnumber": "6077778"}
