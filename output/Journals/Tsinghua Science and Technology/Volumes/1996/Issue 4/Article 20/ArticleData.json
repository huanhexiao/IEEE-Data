To determine properties of mixtures, mixing rules for the parameters in equations of state are necessary. In this s paper, the excess Gibbs energy type of mixing rules are systematically studied. In the mixing rule for parameter a, two terms are found can be cancelled when consistent volume parameters are used. The mixing rule for parameter b is also improved to account for mixtures with large size differences. The new mixing rules give obvious improvement for vepor-liquid equilibria of binary alkane systems, especially of methane or ethane + alkane (carbon number from 3 to 44).", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "410", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "415", "date_publication": "Dec. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "410 - 415"}, "authors": ["Chen Jian", "Li Zongcheng"], "keywords": ["Correlation", "Equations", "Fluids", "Mathematical model", "Predictive models", "TV", "Thermodynamics", "cubic equation of state", "group contribution", "mixing rule", ""], "arnumber": "6077780"}
