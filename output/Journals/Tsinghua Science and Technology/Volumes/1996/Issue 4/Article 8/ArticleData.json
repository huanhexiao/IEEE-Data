A theoretical non-equilibrium-solution diffusion model is proposed. Methods are studied to determine solution rate coefficients and diffusion coefficients. Pervaporation separation of an ethanol-water mixture is simulated on the basis of the new mass transfer model.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "351", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "356", "date_publication": "Dec. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "351 - 356"}, "authors": ["Yu Lixin", "Chen Cuixian", "Zhang Liping", "Yan Jun", "Jiang Weijun"], "keywords": ["Equations", "Ethanol", "Feeds", "Heating", "Mathematical model", "Solvents", "Surface treatment", "PVA/PAN composite membrane", "dehydration", "diffusion model", "membrane separation", "non-equilibrium-solution", "pervaporation", ""], "arnumber": "6077768"}
