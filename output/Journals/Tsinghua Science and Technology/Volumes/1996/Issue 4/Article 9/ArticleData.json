The accuracy of the model is to within 1.185\u00d70025; of the target values. Some important measures are proposed to produce simulated operation cases of the stabilizer to provide training and testing data. Procedures were also developed to improve network testing performance and to avoid oscillatories during this network learning procedure in which improved convergence. These measures can be expanded to any chemical engineering process model using ANNs.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "357", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "361", "date_publication": "Dec. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "357 - 361"}, "authors": ["He Xiaorong", "Aamand Carsten"], "keywords": ["Artificial neural networks", "Convergence", "Data models", "Feeds", "Search problems", "Testing", "Training", "Reid vappor pressure", "artificial neural network", "modeling", "naphtha", ""], "arnumber": "6077769"}
