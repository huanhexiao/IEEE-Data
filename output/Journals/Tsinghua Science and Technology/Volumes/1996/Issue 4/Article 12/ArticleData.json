The TCD interfaces are very friendly to facilitate communication between the user and the computer. TCD can be used not only to design new columns, but also to check old columns for retray application. TCD can be easily learned and mastered. Several design examples are using TCD to display the advantages of TCD. This paper introduces the interface design process, functions and advantages of TCD.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "372", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "375", "date_publication": "Dec. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "372 - 375"}, "authors": ["Peng Jianjun", "Duan Zhanting", "Zhou Rongqi"], "keywords": ["Absorption", "Orifices", "Process control", "Reliability engineering", "Software", "Valves", "Visual BASIC", "column design", "interface", "man-machine interaction", "visual basic", ""], "arnumber": "6077772"}
