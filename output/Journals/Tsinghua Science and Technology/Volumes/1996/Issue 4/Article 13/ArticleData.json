The percolation model was modified using considering the effective volume fraction of the conductive component. The effective volume fractions of CB at various temperatures were calculated based on the temperature dependence of the specific volume of polyethylene (PE) and the temperature dependence of the PE unit cell parameters. The temperature dependence of the specimen resistance was then calculated using the modified percolation model.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "376", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "381", "date_publication": "Dec. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "376 - 381"}, "authors": ["Zhou Xiao", "Li Weimin", "Pan Gaofeng"], "keywords": ["Carbon", "Crystals", "Heating", "Quantum mechanics", "Resistance", "Temperature", "PTC materials", "carbon black", "conductive polymer composite", "current conduction mechanism", "polyethylene", "polymer base composite", ""], "arnumber": "6077773"}
