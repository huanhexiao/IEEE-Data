The FT-IR spectra of solvents loaded with organic acids and water were determined. The effects of campositions of mixed solvent, diluent, and solute concentrations on the coextracted water corcentration were discussed The results are beneficial for optimising mixed solvent composition and for enhancing the extraction process.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "347", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "350", "date_publication": "Dec. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "347 - 350"}, "authors": ["Yang Yiyan", "Fu Yiqun", "Zhao Hong", "Dai Youyuan"], "keywords": ["Bonding", "Bridges", "Chemicals", "Electric potential", "Phase measurement", "Solvents", "Water resources", "extraction based on camplexation", "tri-n-octylamine", "water coextraction", ""], "arnumber": "6077767"}
