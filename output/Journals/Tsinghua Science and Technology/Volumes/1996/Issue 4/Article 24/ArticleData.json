The optimal conditions for determining the lead content in nickel nitrate were found by the homogeneous design method. These conditions improved the sensitivity, the detection limit and eliminate interference. The sensitivity by the FIA-FAAS flame atomic absorption spectrophotometry was increased 76 times than that of the FAAS and the detection limit by the FIA-FAAS was reduced 50 times than that of the FAAS. The precision of the FIA-FAAS is as good as FAAS method.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "429", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "432", "date_publication": "Dec. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "429 - 432"}, "authors": ["Wang Jianchen", "Wong Ximei", "Wang Qiuping"], "keywords": ["Absorption", "Calibration", "Equations", "FAA", "Lead", "Nickel", "Resins", "crown ether dicyclohexano-18-crown-6", "flame atomic absorption spectophotometry", "flow injection", "lead", "levextrel resin", ""], "arnumber": "6077784"}
