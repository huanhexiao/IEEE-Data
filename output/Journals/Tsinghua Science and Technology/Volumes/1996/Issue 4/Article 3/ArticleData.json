A new type of sensor was used to measure the wave signals in a VFB. The experimental results show that the vibration energy imparted is through continuous wave propagation in the vibrating fluidized bed. Wave characteristics are affected by the bed properties. A bubble's behavior in the bed is followed by analyzing the wave frequency spectrum.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "327", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "331", "date_publication": "Dec. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "327 - 331"}, "authors": ["Wang Tingjie", "Wang Zhanwen", "Jin Yang", "Yu Zhiqing"], "keywords": ["Atmospheric measurements", "Particle measurements", "Powders", "Propagation", "Time frequency analysis", "Vibrations", "bubble", "fluidized bed", "vibrating fluidized bed", "vibration wave", "wave propagation", ""], "arnumber": "6077763"}
