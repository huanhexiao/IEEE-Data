The photoresist, made from the above polyimide precursor, was spin-coated onto silicon wafers, prebaked and then exposed to UV light. The appropriate conditions of the photolithographic procedures were determined. This photosensitive polyimide precursor showed good light sensitivity and the polyimide which was obtained by heating the polyimide precursor had a high thermal stability.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "386", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "389", "date_publication": "Dec. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "386 - 389"}, "authors": ["You Fengxiang", "He Kaizhang", "Chen Qidao", "Hong Xiaoyin"], "keywords": ["Films", "Heating", "Polyimides", "Resists", "Sensitivity", "Thermal analysis", "Thermal stability", "high thermal stability", "negative-working", "photoresist", "photosensitive polyimide", ""], "arnumber": "6077775"}
