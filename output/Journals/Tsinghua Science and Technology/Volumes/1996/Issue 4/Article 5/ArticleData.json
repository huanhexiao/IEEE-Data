Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG 4000) and polyvinylpyroolidone K30 (PVP K30) were applied to the MFE as shielding polymers to prevent protein adsorption on the polysulfone microfiltration membrane during the electrophoresis process. The effects of polymer concentration on the protein transmembrane flux were examined. It was found that PVA, PEG 4000 and PVP K30 greatly reduced protein adsorption on the membrane surface. However, their influences on protein migration in an electric field were different. Continuous separationof bovine serumalbumin and hemoglobin mixture was conducted using PEG 4000 as a shielding polymer and yielded 46. 6 mg BSA and 25. 7 mg HBB per hour. These results show a high potential for scaling MFE up to large scale separation and purification of biomolecules.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "336", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "340", "date_publication": "Dec. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "336 - 340"}, "authors": ["Liu Zheng", "Zhao Yin", "Wang Jin", "Huang Zheng", "Ding Fuxin", "Yuan Naiju"], "keywords": ["Biomembranes", "Electric potential", "Molecular biophysics", "Plastics", "Proteins", "Purification", "Surface treatment", "el ectrophoresis", "multichannel flow electrophoresis", "separation", ""], "arnumber": "6077765"}
