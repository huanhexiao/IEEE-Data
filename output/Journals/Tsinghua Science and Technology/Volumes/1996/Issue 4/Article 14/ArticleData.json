These two polymers could crosslink with each other to form a composite coating in the presence of a basic catalyst at room temperature. A model Michael reaction between ethyl acetoacetate (EAA) and methyl acrylate (MA) was used to investigate the crosslinking mechanism. The results indicate that the two active hydrogen atoms in the acetoacetyl group could both react with vinyl groups to form mono- and bis-adducts in a two step process.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "382", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "385", "date_publication": "Dec. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "382 - 385"}, "authors": ["Tang Liming", "Guo Wei", "Liu Deshan", "Zhou Qixiang"], "keywords": ["Coatings", "Curing", "Mechanical factors", "Methanol", "Plastics", "Solids", "Viscosity", "acetoacetyl group", "crosslinking mechanism", "polyacrylate", "polyurethane", "vinyl group", ""], "arnumber": "6077774"}
