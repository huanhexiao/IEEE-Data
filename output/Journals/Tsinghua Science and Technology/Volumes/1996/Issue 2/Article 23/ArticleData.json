Guided by systems engineering ideology, the architecture uses object-oriented technology, rapid prototyping and fourth generation languages. The architecture overcomes problems in CIMS/MIS development, such as low efficiency, long development time, unability to adapt to requirement changes, maintenance difficulties, etc. to develop a rapid, integrated, open CIMS/MIS development platform. This paper also briefly discusses implementation of this rapid application development and integration support system, which can be used as an integrated MIS development platform for various kinds of offices and enterprises, especially those employing CIMS.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "208", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "213", "date_publication": "June 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "208 - 213"}, "authors": ["Chai Yueting", "Li Fangyun", "Zhou Yongchuan"], "keywords": ["Computer integrated manufacturing", "Data models", "Database systems", "Distributed databases", "Hardware", "Software", "CIMS/MIS", "development platform", "integration", "openness", "rapid", ""], "arnumber": "6077970"}
