CAIP generates inspection process data based on the product design requirements. Therefore, a unified product information model should be used to share product data with the CAD system. As a data exchange standard covering the complete product life cycle, STEP could be used to integrate data transfer between CAD and CAIP. An inspection oriented mechanical product information model (IOMPIM) is proposed in this paper. It includes form features, dimensional and tolerance information and uses EXPRESS for information modeling. The STEP pre-processor and post-processor have been developed to transfer product model information between CAD and CAIP using the STEP neutral file. In preliminary system tests, product information for many complex parts was transferred through the CIMS environment with the CAIP system generating rational inspection processes. A coordinate measuring machine was then used for quality inspection of the parts.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "167", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "171", "date_publication": "June 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "167 - 171"}, "authors": ["Cheng Ye", "Cai Fuzhi", "Huang Linchang"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Data models", "Design automation", "Inspection", "Planning", "Shape", "Solid modeling", "CAD", "STEP", "computer aided inspection planning", "integration", ""], "arnumber": "6077962"}
