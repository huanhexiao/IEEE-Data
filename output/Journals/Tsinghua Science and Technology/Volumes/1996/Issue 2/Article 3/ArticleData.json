A gear box conceptual design expert system for planomilling machines was developed which solved the problem of information integration from conceptual design to detail design. The problem-solving model for the conceptual design of mechanical products is discussed. The system architecture and the function of the main modules are described. The basic structure for the object-oriented knowledge representation and its formalized representation are discussed in detail. Finally, implementation of the scheme layout and its control flow chart are explored using several samples.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "103", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "108", "date_publication": "June 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "103 - 108"}, "authors": ["Tong Bingshu", "Yonas Hagos"], "keywords": ["Cognition", "Design automation", "Expert systems", "Layout", "Object oriented modeling", "Problem-solving", "Solid modeling", "CAD/CAM integration", "conceptual design", "expert systems", "mechanical design", ""], "arnumber": "6077950"}
