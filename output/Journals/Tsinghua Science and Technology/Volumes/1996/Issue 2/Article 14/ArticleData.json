To facilitate application of RP&M technology as an enabling technology in product development and manufacturing, our center has done a series of pojects covering RP theory (modern shaping science), new RP processes and equipment, rapid tooling technology and rapid product development systems. With the STEP protocol and product modeling technology, RP&M technology can be integrated into CIMS to form a new subsystem, the free form manufacturing subsystem. The subsystem architecture is investigated in this paper.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "162", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "166", "date_publication": "June 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "162 - 166"}, "authors": ["Wang Jianguo", "Yan Yongnian", "Du Zhaohui"], "keywords": ["Computer integrated manufacturing", "Design automation", "Manufacturing", "Materials", "Process control", "Prototypes", "Solid modeling", "CIMS", "free form manufacturing", "modern shaping science", "rapid product development", "rapid prototyping and manufacturing (RP&#x0026", "M)", "rapid tooling", ""], "arnumber": "6077961"}
