For CIMS R&D, the research is application-oriented and the results guide the development of further applications. CIMS applications in China emphasize two aspects. First, CIMS projects are not only technology applications, but are a combination of technology and management related to enterprise reform and business process re-engineering. Second, they are not individual information technology applications, but an integrated application of information technology for the entire system. After describing some test-case at CIMS reference sites, the experience and principles used to guide successful implementation are discussed.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "95", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "97", "date_publication": "June 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "95 - 97"}, "authors": ["Wu Cheng"], "keywords": ["Companies", "Computer integrated manufacturing", "Distributed databases", "Educational institutions", "Industries", "Information technology", "Manufacturing", "CIMS", "China", "application", "progress", "research", ""], "arnumber": "6077948"}
