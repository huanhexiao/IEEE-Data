An effective method for solving problems which occur when implementing drawing data integration between CAD/CAM systems through IGES files is then discussed. Finally, a middle-adjusting-processor program is proposed to solve specific problems which exist in CAD/CAM integration in CIMS/ERC. The program successfully solves the problem of drawing deformation between the I-DEAS system and the CIMLINC system during data exchange.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "109", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "112", "date_publication": "June 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "109 - 112"}, "authors": ["Li Jianming", "Xu Longwen"], "keywords": ["Computer aided manufacturing", "Computer integrated manufacturing", "Data structures", "Design automation", "Graphics", "Software", "Solid modeling", "CAD/CAM integration", "IGES file", "incompatible entity", "middle-adjusting-processor", ""], "arnumber": "6077951"}
