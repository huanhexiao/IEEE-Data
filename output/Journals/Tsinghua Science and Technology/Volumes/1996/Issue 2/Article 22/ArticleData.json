Production-oriented development policy is presented with an appropriate framework. A distributed production-oriented software platform model based on micro-computer hardware and supported by a real-time operating system and database was formed. The structure includes four parts: user interface, application management (operation management, network management), communication device and real-time database. A flexible software framework was constructed using the object-oriented design method and an interface standard. A distributed manufacturing system was developed in the second stage.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "202", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "207", "date_publication": "June 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "202 - 207"}, "authors": ["Wu Nianyu", "An Yunbo"], "keywords": ["Computer integrated manufacturing", "Databases", "Hardware", "Manufacturing", "Production", "Real time systems", "Software", "distributed control system", "integrated software platform", "software platform", ""], "arnumber": "6077969"}
