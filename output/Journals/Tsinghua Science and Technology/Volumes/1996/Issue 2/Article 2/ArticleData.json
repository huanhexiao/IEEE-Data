Based on the function-oriented multi-view modeling approach, an object-oriented integrated multi-view modeling approach was further provided. CIM system is composed of several objects where each object has a multi-view description. The four most important view-points: function, information, resource and dynamic viewpoint were chosen to provide conceptual model of the object-oriented integrated multi-view modeling in CIMS using a system integration approach", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "98", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "102", "date_publication": "June 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "98 - 102"}, "authors": ["Chen Jiadong", "Xiong Guangleng"], "keywords": ["Buildings", "Computational modeling", "Computer integrated manufacturing", "Dynamic scheduling", "Mathematical model", "Object oriented modeling", "Open systems", "Petri-net", "multi-view modeling", "object-oriented", "simulation", ""], "arnumber": "6077949"}
