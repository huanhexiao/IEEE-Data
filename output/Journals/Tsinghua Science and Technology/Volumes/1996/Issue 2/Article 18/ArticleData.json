Concurrent engineering is itself dependent on an effective machining process simulator that verifies the machining process. A machining process simulator for concurrent engineering CMPS was developed at CIMS-ERC to meet the need for an effective simulator. This paper introduces the CMPS structure, key techniques, including geometry model construction and kinematics. NC code translation, collision and interference checks, material removal simulation, machining animation, etc. The model uses the solid Ray-representation method and the Voxels plus B-representation algorithm. The Ray-representation method simplifies the Boolean operation process and improves the material removal simulation speed. The Voxels plus B-representation algorithm quickly detects collision and interference problems. Finally. CMPS is applied to an actual NC milling process as an example.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "181", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "184", "date_publication": "June 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "181 - 184"}, "authors": ["Han Xiangli", "Yang Gang", "Xiao Tianyuan"], "keywords": ["Animation", "Concurrent engineering", "Data models", "Fixtures", "Machining", "Materials", "Solid modeling", "CIMS", "concurrent engineering", "machining process simulation", ""], "arnumber": "6077965"}
