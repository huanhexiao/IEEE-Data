The FDM was used to calculate the temperature distribution while the FEM was used for the stress simulation. For practical application, a machine tool bed iron casting was selected and the high temperature mechanical properties of the cast iron were measured. The FDM/FEM simulation results of the temperature and stress distributions of the solidification process of the casting using current production technology agreed well with the measured temperature and residual stress results. A modified production technology was then proposed. The numerical simulation results showed that the temperature distribution of the modified production technology was more uniform and the distribution and value of residual stresses were more favorable to dimensional stability of the machine tool.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "176", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "180", "date_publication": "June 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "176 - 180"}, "authors": ["Xiong Shoumei", "Liu Baicheng", "Zhu Riming", "Gao Ying"], "keywords": ["Casting", "Finite element methods", "Frequency division multiplexing", "Machine tools", "Stress", "Temperature distribution", "Temperature measurement", "FDM", "FEM", "machine tool bed casting", "numerical simulation", "residual stress", ""], "arnumber": "6077964"}
