Since ANN is self-learning, ANN has remarkable advantages in representing and acquiring of technical knowledge (especially that which is difficult to symbolize). In addition, since many procedures in CAPP are essentially optimization, ANN's combinatorial optimization capability can be very useful. Both of these aspects of applying ANN to CAPP are described using an example which deals with process planning for machining of mechanical components.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "130", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "133", "date_publication": "June 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "130 - 133"}, "authors": ["Wang Xiankui", "Pu Jian", "Wu Dan", "Xu Zhongxin"], "keywords": ["Artificial neural networks", "Computers", "Learning systems", "Machining", "Neurons", "Optimization", "Process planning", "artificial neural networks", "combinatorial optimization", "computer aided process planning", ""], "arnumber": "6077955"}
