Since the integer program falls within the NP class of problems, then its complexity increases exponentially as the problem size increases, making the problem intractable even for a medium size system. An approximate algorithm, whose complexity only increases algebraically with the problem size, is presented to obtain suboptimal solutions of scheduling problems. Numerical experiments indicate that the suboptimal solution is near to the optimal solution in the general case where the neighboring points are dense around the optimal solution in the feasible region of the integer program.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "197", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "201", "date_publication": "June 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "197 - 201"}, "authors": ["Yang Sheng", "Wu Cheng"], "keywords": ["Approximation algorithms", "Complexity theory", "Job shop scheduling", "Manufacturing systems", "Presses", "Vectors", "approximate algorithm", "flexible transfer line", "integer program", "scheduling", ""], "arnumber": "6077968"}
