Concurrent engineering is one of the large, complex programs that benefits from using the object-oriented method. This paper first introduces some popular object-oriented design methods and then focuses on the IDEF 4 method. The IDEF 4 method is one member of IDEF, which is an integrated family of integration definition methods. The IDEF 4 method was applied to the development of a specific system. Application of the method exposes the advantages and disadvantages of IDEF 4. An enhancement method, IDEF 4X, is proposed to provide a more powerful object-oriented method.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "139", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "145", "date_publication": "June 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "139 - 145"}, "authors": ["Zhou Zhiying", "Wang Ping"], "keywords": ["Concurrent engineering", "Data models", "Design methodology", "Libraries", "Object oriented modeling", "Protocols", "Semantics", "IDEF (integration definition)", "class", "methods", "object-oriented design", ""], "arnumber": "6077957"}
