As a solution to this issue, a multidatabase integration environment, CIMBASE, has been developed. CIMBASE adopts an object-oriented data model and provides users with a series of software tools: a query language, a pre-compiler, a graphical database schema editor, a graphical query interface and a form based query generation tool. This paper discusses in detail the major aspects of CIMBASE: its object-oriented data model, query language interpreter and the design and implementation of its pre-compiler. The design and algorithms presented in this paper provide a solid foundation for research on multi-database integration.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "146", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "152", "date_publication": "June 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "146 - 152"}, "authors": ["Wang Lingchi", "Zhou Lizhu", "Wang Guoren", "Zheng Huaiyuan"], "keywords": ["Algebra", "Calculus", "Computer integrated manufacturing", "Data models", "Distributed databases", "Semantics", "CIMS", "data model", "distributed database", "object-oriented database", "pre-compiler", "query language", ""], "arnumber": "6077958"}
