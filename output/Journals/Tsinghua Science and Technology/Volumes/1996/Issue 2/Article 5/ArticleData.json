CAD can not only meet the demands of design, but also meet the demands of the subsystems, such as CAPP and CAM. The product modelling system based on STEP (PMSS) uses the I-DEAS system and adopts STEP as its mechanism to exchange product information. PMSS closely integrates with I-DEAS and takes advantage of the functions of I-DEAS to meet the demands of CAD/CAPP/CAM integration. For integration with other systems, PMSS uses management tool for STEP file to manage information required by subsystems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "113", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "118", "date_publication": "June 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "113 - 118"}, "authors": ["Meng Mingchen", "Sun Yan", "Yang Ling", "Wang Ge"], "keywords": ["Data models", "Databases", "Design automation", "Protocols", "Rough surfaces", "Solid modeling", "Surface roughness", "STEP", "STEP management tool", "application protocol", "feature modelling", "product information modelling", ""], "arnumber": "6077952"}
