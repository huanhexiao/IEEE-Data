Using the information integration capabilities of computer integrated manufacturing system (CIMS), it shortens product leadtime, improves product quality and reduces product cost. This paper analyzes the essential features of concurrent engineering and introduces some typical methods and technologies used in concurrent engineering. The paper also describes the application methodology used in the ongoing project entitled \u201cconcurrent engineering\u201d of the National High-Tech Development Program of China.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "185", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "192", "date_publication": "June 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "185 - 192"}, "authors": ["Xiong Guangleng", "Zhang Yuyun"], "keywords": ["Companies", "Computer integrated manufacturing", "Concurrent engineering", "Manufacturing", "Product development", "Production", "Systematics", "computer integrateed manufacturing", "concurrent engineering", "product development", ""], "arnumber": "6077966"}
