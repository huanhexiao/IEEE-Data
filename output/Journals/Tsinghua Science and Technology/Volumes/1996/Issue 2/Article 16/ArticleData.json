The proposed strategy uses wear feature extraction based on procett modelling and parameter estimation. The adaptive model traces the properties of cutting processes by combining process state signals, cutting conditions, a force model and the least squares method. The tool wear feature is obtained from the estimated parameters of the model. Experimental results show that changes of the parameters in the cutting force model reliably indicate tool wear independent of variation of the cutting conditions.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "172", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "175", "date_publication": "June 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "172 - 175"}, "authors": ["Wan Jun", "Zhao Fan", "Wu Xinghao", "Cai Fuzhi"], "keywords": ["Adaptation models", "Estimation", "Feature extraction", "Force", "Mathematical model", "Monitoring", "Parameter estimation", "feature extraction", "intelligent monitoring", "parameter estimation", "process model", "tool wear", ""], "arnumber": "6077963"}
