The MQN was solved by analyzing a general open MQN with limited clients. In addition, the steady-state probability distribution theorem was proven. Thus, analytical load indices such as queue length at the servers and the server efficiency were obtained. Moreover, the sufficient and necessary conditions for server load balance were found. Finally, a client/server system was analyzed to illustrate the procedure for computing system load indices. The results are not only helpful for analyzing bottlenecks in the client/server system, but are also fundamental to static system configuration design.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "193", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "196", "date_publication": "June 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "193 - 196"}, "authors": ["Jin Zunhe", "Wu Cheng", "Wang Ran"], "keywords": ["Computer networks", "Computers", "Load modeling", "Servers", "Steady-state", "System performance", "Vectors", "Macovo process", "client/server", "queuing network", "system modeling", ""], "arnumber": "6077967"}
