Then, the modeling of alternative process planning based on Petri nets is discussed in detail. The modeling process is partitioned into three stages: the modeling of feature operation chains and grouped feature operation chains, the modeling of a feature group's setup determination and the modeling of part setups and related machine function. This paper focuses on the first and the third stages. Furthermore, a case study and implementation of system are described.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "124", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "129", "date_publication": "June 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "124 - 129"}, "authors": ["Zhang Yuyun", "Wu Ruirong", "Wang Xiankui"], "keywords": ["Computer aided manufacturing", "Computer integrated manufacturing", "Computers", "Design automation", "Machining", "Planning", "Process planning", "Petri nets", "alternative process planning", "feature group", "setup", ""], "arnumber": "6077954"}
