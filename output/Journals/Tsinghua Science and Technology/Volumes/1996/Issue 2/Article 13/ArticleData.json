A new type of IMNC for box-shaped parts has been developed which can achieve various intelligent processing functions such as automatic adjustment of the part's rough localization; blank remainder based automatic determination of cutting times in rough machining; quality control supervision, measurement and machining compensation in fine processing, and breakdown anticipation in drilling, reaming and tapping. The IMNC is integrated with the CAD/CAPP/CAM environment and can be automatically generated on the CAM console. The flexibility of the manufacturing system's facilities layer has been greatly improved.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "157", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "161", "date_publication": "June 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "157 - 161"}, "authors": ["Duan Guanghong", "Ye Beihua", "Hu Dongming", "Zhang Jie", "Wu Ruirong"], "keywords": ["Artificial intelligence", "Computer aided manufacturing", "Computer integrated manufacturing", "Machining", "Manufacturing systems", "Probes", "Process control", "CAM", "CIMS", "intelligent NC", "intelligent machining", ""], "arnumber": "6077960"}
