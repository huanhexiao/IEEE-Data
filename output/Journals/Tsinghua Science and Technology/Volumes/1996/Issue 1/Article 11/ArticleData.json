The main barrier which prevents fission product release is the SiC layer of the coated fuel particles. Fabrication of high quality SiC layers is one of the key R&D tasks for the HTR-10 fuel element. The SiC layer was deposited on the fuel particles in a 50 mm conical fluidized bed using the CVD (chemical vapour deposition) technique. The density, thickness, strength and elastic modulus of the SiC layer were measured. The microstructure was observed using SEM (scanning electron microscope). Parameters were established for manufacturing the SiC layer of the coated fuel particles to be used in the HTR-10. It was found that the traditional density measurement by the sink-float method is questionable in the low density region and that the SiC layer may be contaminated by uranium under certain conditions.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "45", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "49", "date_publication": "March 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "45 - 49"}, "authors": ["Xu Shijiang", "Yang Bing", "Zhu Junguo", "Zhang Bingzhong", "Zhao Zhichao", "Cheng Bihua", "Zhang Dongemei", "Zhang Chun"], "keywords": ["Argon", "Carbon", "Fuels", "Inductors", "Pollution measurement", "Silicon carbide", "Temperature measurement", "SiC", "coated fuel particle", "density", "fuel element", "high temperature gas-cooled reactor", "microstructure", "strength", "uranium contamination", ""], "arnumber": "6078143"}
