The time domain code RETRAN-02 and the frequency domain code NUFREQ were applied to estimate the instability boundary and the effects of such parameters as pressure, inlet resistance and riser height in NHR-5 and an experimental loop. The results of the calculations and the experiments are in good agreement. Nonlinear density wave oscillations were analyzed using the RETRAN-02 code. The theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics was used to find an explicit criterion to estimate the threshold of the stability. Experimental simulation of the nuclear feedback density wave instability was also carried out in a test loop using computer controlled electric power.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "23", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "26", "date_publication": "March 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "23 - 26"}, "authors": ["Li Jincai", "Gao Zuying", "Zhang Zuoyi"], "keywords": ["Entropy", "Heating", "Inductors", "Oscillators", "Stability criteria", "Thermal stability", "flow instability", "nuclear heating reactor (NHR)", "safety", "thermal-hydraulics", ""], "arnumber": "6078138"}
