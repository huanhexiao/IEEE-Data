It has inherent safety features common to the new generation of advanced reactors, i.e. the reactor automatically shuts down because of the negative temperature reactivity coefficients and the decay heat is passively removed from the reactor to the environment. A thorough accident safety analysis of HTR-10 was carried out, after establishing safety criteria and classifying the accident scenarios. Analysis results of the design basis accidents and the beyond design basis accidents are provided in this paper. It is demonstrated that HTR-10 has excellent inherent safety features.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "31", "date_publication": "March 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "27 - 31"}, "authors": ["Gao Zuying", "Jiang Zhiqiang", "Li Baoyan", "Wang Chunyun"], "keywords": ["Accidents", "Cavity resonators", "Fuels", "Heating", "Helium", "Inductors", "Safety", "accident", "safety analysis", "thermal-hydraulic calculation", ""], "arnumber": "6078139"}
