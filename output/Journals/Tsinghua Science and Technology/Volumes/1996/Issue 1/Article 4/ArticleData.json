The enrichment of the fuel assemblies is used as the control variable with the objective to minimize the power peaking factor. The optimization methods are applied indirectly because it is difficult to directly relate the control variable and the object function in a single equation. Therefore, the solution uses linearized functons which are solved with linear programming. The corrected simplex method is used to solve the optimal problem. Useful engineer software has been designed and used in reactor physics design.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "16", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "18", "date_publication": "March 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "16 - 18"}, "authors": ["Zhong Wenfa", "Shan Wenzhi", "Luo Rong"], "keywords": ["Assembly", "Fuels", "Inductors", "Linear programming", "Loading", "Optimization", "Vectors", "fuel assembly", "nuclear heating reactor (NHR)", "optimization fuel loading", ""], "arnumber": "6078136"}
