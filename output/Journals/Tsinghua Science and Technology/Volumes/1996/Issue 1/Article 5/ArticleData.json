The bi-orthogonality and completeness of the HOH set are studied, and they are the theoretical basis for the flux mapping method. Using the bi-orthogonality of HOH and the strict formula for eigenvalue estimation, the process and formulas for HOH calculation called as the source iteration method with source correction are derived. The analysis can predict any order of harmonics for 2- or 3-dimensional geometries. Preliminary verification of the capability for flux mapping is also given, and other applications of HOH for reactor operation analysis and failure diagnosis are underway.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "19", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "22", "date_publication": "March 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "19 - 22"}, "authors": ["Li Fu", "Hu Yongming", "Luo Zhengpei"], "keywords": ["Detectors", "Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions", "Equations", "Harmonic analysis", "Inductors", "Mathematical model", "Solid modeling", "adjoint equation", "bi-orthogonality", "flux mapping", "higher order harmonics", "source iteration method with source correction", ""], "arnumber": "6078137"}
