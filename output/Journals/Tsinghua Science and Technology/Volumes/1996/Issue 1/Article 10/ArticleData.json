One of its objectives is to develop high temperature process heat applications. To realize this target, various high temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) process heat applications have been analyzed. This paper briefly describes the possibilities and experimental schemes for using the HTR-10 for process heat application studies.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "40", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "44", "date_publication": "March 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "40 - 44"}, "authors": ["Xu Yuanhui", "Ju Huaiming", "Zhong Daxin"], "keywords": ["Coal", "Electricity", "Helium", "Inductors", "Turbines", "Water heating", "HTGR", "gas-turbine cycle", "high temperature reactor", "process heat", ""], "arnumber": "6078142"}
