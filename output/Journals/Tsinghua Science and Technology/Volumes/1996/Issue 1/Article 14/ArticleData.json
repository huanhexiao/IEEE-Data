In the development of these SW guides, various subjects, including particle dynamics, microwave properties etc, were studied. The factors influencing the transverse motion were considered analytically and using a simulation code, TRSV. The problem of electron backbombardment in SW linac was analyzed by a 3-dimensional trace code, SB. Simultaneously decreasing the length of the first cavity and the injection voltage can reduced the electron backbombarding power. The code PPDW based on equivalent circuit theory was developed to analyze many microwave characteristics of arbitrarily composed coupled cavity chains. This research contributed to the successful development of the 3, 4, 6, 9 and 14MeV SW accelerator guides. For example, in the recently developed 14MeV SW guide, the beam passes smoothly through a 1.45 m long guide with a beamhole (diameter of 7 mm) without using a focusing solenoid.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "70", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "76", "date_publication": "March 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "70 - 76"}, "authors": ["Lin Yuzheng", "Tong Dechun", "Yang Yue", "Jin Qingxiu", "Sun Xiang", "Sun Jingqing", "Hu Shaoguang", "Chen Huaibi", "Huang Hai", "Chen Bingyi", "Zhang Yilin", "Li Yuezeng", "Sun Baoyu", "Hu Wenshing", "Zou Yang"], "keywords": ["Acceleration", "Cavity resonators", "Couplings", "Focusing", "Linear particle accelerator", "Microwave theory and techniques", "Radio frequency", "accelerator guide", "electron backbombardment", "electron linac", "medical and industrial uses", "microwave properties", "particle dynamics simulation", "standing-wave", ""], "arnumber": "6078146"}
