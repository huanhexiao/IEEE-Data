OPTROD. based on dynamic programming method is developed and utilized to optimize control rod positions throughout the fuel cycle of the 200 MW nuclear heating reactor (NHR-200). A fuel cycle is divided into many steps or stages. Optimization of the multistage process is solved iteratively in the forward direction throughout a fuel cycle. The dynamic programming method is much more efficient than the normal nonlinear programming method. Convergence is obtained even if poor initial control rod positions are given.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "12", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "15", "date_publication": "March 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "12 - 15"}, "authors": ["Hu Yongming", "Xu Yunlin"], "keywords": ["Dynamic programming", "Fuels", "Heating", "Inductors", "Mathematical model", "Optimization", "Programming", "control rod", "dynamic programming", "multistage", "nonlinear programming", "nuclear heating reactor", "optimize", ""], "arnumber": "6078135"}
