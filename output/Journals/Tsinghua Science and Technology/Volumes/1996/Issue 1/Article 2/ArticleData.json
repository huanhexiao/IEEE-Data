Several events have been identified to be the bounding, hypothetical accidents for the MHTGR. The important accident sequences leading to severe accidents are ingress of a large amount of water or air into the core. The analyses of severe accident scenarios have shown that even the harm of fuel element predicted to occur by chemical reaction after a hypothetical large amount of water ingress into the core or air ingress into the core will not result in major impact on the environment due to the integrity of fuel particles remained. Therefore, it would not be necessary to require an emergency plan to evacuate nearby inhabitants.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "8", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "11", "date_publication": "March 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "8 - 11"}, "authors": ["Wu Zongxin"], "keywords": ["Accidents", "Cavity resonators", "Coolants", "Fuels", "Heating", "Inductors", "Safety", "inherent safety", "modular high temperature gas-cooled reactors", "reactor safety", ""], "arnumber": "6078134"}
