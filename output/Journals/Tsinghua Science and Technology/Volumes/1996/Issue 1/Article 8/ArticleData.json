Experiments show that the three cases of LOCAs (loss of coolant accidents) have different patterns. In the case of a pipe break connected to the gas plenum, the quantity of water lost is independent of the diameter of the broken pipe. In the case of a pipe located near the liquid level, the quantity of water lost depends on the location of the pipe. In the case of a pipe break below the water level, all the water above the break will be discharged. The discharge patterns for all three cases are analyzed in detail.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "32", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "35", "date_publication": "March 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "32 - 35"}, "authors": ["Ma Changwen", "Bo Jinhai", "Jia Haijun"], "keywords": ["Fault location", "Inductors", "Orifices", "Safety", "Valves", "Water heating", "loss of coolant", "nuclear heating reactor", "pipe break", ""], "arnumber": "6078140"}
