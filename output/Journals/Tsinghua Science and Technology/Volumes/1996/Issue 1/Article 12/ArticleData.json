The results indicate that the artificial graphite has the slowest oxidation rate followed by the natural graphite and then the resin carbon with the highest oxidation rate. Vacuum heat treatment of the natural graphite at 1950 \u00b0C decreases the impurities and increases the oxidation activation energy. Differences between the activation energy and the oxidation rate of the resin carbon heat treated at 1 950 \u00b0 and 1 600 \u00b0C resulted from changes in the micro-pore texture and the reduction of impurities.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "50", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "55", "date_publication": "March 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "50 - 55"}, "authors": ["Zhang Shichao", "He Jun", "Qiu Xueliang", "Ma Changwen"], "keywords": ["Carbon", "Heat treatment", "Heating", "Impurities", "Oxidation", "Resins", "fuel element", "graphite", "high temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR)", "matrix materials", "oxidation", ""], "arnumber": "6078144"}
