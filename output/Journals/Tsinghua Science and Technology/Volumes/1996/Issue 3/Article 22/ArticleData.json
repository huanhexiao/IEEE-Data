The experimental method and procedures, as well as the experimental results are discussed in detail. The good experimental results verify the feasibility of studying the damper damage procedure with the single flash dynamic moire method.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "310", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "313", "date_publication": "Sept. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "310 - 313"}, "authors": ["Xie Huimin", "Peter Dietz", "Axel Schmidt", "Dai Fulong", "Van Shuru"], "keywords": ["Cameras", "Gratings", "Load modeling", "Shock absorbers", "Springs", "Strain", "Strain measurement", "impact", "moire method", "single flash method", ""], "arnumber": "6077905"}
