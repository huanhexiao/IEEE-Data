By alyzing the propertieses of the penalty function, an exterior central path is introduced. It is shown that the exterior central path has some similar properties as the interior or one in a linear programming case, If the starting point is close to the path, by following the path with an appropriate step, a polynomial al gorithm is derived. Usually, the starting point is not in the polytope, the method can be seen as an infeasible-interior-point one. It is also discussed how to get an appropriate starting point.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "279", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "284", "date_publication": "Sept. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "279 - 284"}, "authors": ["Jiang Jianmin", "Shi Miaogen"], "keywords": ["Convergence", "Lagrangian functions", "Newton method", "Polynomials", "Prediction algorithms", "Vectors", "exterior center path", "penalty function", "primal infeasible-interior-point method", "weighted analytic center", ""], "arnumber": "6077899"}
