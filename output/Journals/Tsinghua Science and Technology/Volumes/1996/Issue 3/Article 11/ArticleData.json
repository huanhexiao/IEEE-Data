In his study of the structure of expanding attractors, R. F. Williams shows that the weak topological equivalence for expanding attractors can be reduced to the easily studied shift equivalence. A more general question is whether this reduction also holds for general hyperbolic attractors. This paper shows that such a reduction does not hold. In fact it is proved that shift equivalence will imply topological equivalence for some Anosov endomorphisms. As a result, the structure of true hyperbolic attractors must be determined by weak topological equivalence.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "260", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "262", "date_publication": "Sept. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "260 - 262"}, "authors": ["Zhang Meirong"], "keywords": ["Agricultural machinery", "Bismuth", "Equations", "Frequency modulation", "Manifolds", "System-on-a-chip", "Topology", "Anosov endomorphism", "shift equivalence", "topological equivalence", "weak topdogical equivalence", ""], "arnumber": "6077894"}
