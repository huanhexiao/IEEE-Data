First, the formal evaluation of entropy production in rarefied gas flow is introduced. Then, the entropy production calculation for arbitrary molecules with spherically symmetric intermolecular forces by Sonine polynomial expansion is presented and the formula for the entropy production in the thirteen-moment approximation is obtained. The results show that entropy production can be expressed as a linear combination of square terms in the thirteen-moment approximation. This formula can be applied to slightly rarefied gas flow.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "215", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "220", "date_publication": "Sept. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "215 - 220"}, "authors": ["Liu Guangjun"], "keywords": ["Approximation methods", "Distribution functions", "Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions", "Entropy", "Fluid flow", "Polynomials", "Production", "entropy", "kinetic theory of gases", "transport theory", ""], "arnumber": "6077884"}
