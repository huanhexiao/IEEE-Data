A new technique to find nonlinear switching surfaces is presented. This method is then used to design the control strategy for the excitation system. Responses to various large perturbations are simulated. The simulation results show that applying the VSC method to the excitation control system can considerably improve the transient stability limit of power systems and improve the dynamic properties of generators.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "290", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "294", "date_publication": "Sept. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "290 - 294"}, "authors": ["Han Yunrui"], "keywords": ["Generators", "Mathematical model", "Power system stability", "Switches", "Transient analysis", "equivalent control", "excitation", "limitation of transient stability", "power system", "switching surface", "variable structure system", ""], "arnumber": "6077901"}
