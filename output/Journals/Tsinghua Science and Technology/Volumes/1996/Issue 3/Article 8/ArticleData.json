The explicit expression for both the energy velocity and the group velocity is obtained for waves in an isotropic homogeneous plate waveguide. Calculations show the values of the group velocity or the energy velocity to be negative for some frequencies.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "250", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "252", "date_publication": "Sept. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "250 - 252"}, "authors": ["Chen Yu"], "keywords": ["Dispersion", "Equations", "Propagation", "Stress", "Surface waves", "System-on-a-chip", "energy velocity", "negative group velocity", "plate waveguide", ""], "arnumber": "6077891"}
