This method splits F into p blocks, then does the asynchronous parallel iteration the p multiprocessor with shared memory. Because each processor need only solve equations with a low dimension and there is no synchronous waiting time, the parallel efficiercy can be increased. Finally, we give the results of the numerical test of three kinds of Newton-like asyrchronous block iteration methods which runwell on a multiprocessor system. These results show that the parallel efficiency is very high.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "285", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "289", "date_publication": "Sept. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "285 - 289"}, "authors": ["Li Qingyang", "Cao Yang", "Tian Zhaoyun"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Bismuth", "Convergence", "Iterative methods", "Jacobian matrices", "Nonlinear equations", "asynchronous block iterative method (ABI-method)", "nonlinear equations", "shared memory processors", ""], "arnumber": "6077900"}
