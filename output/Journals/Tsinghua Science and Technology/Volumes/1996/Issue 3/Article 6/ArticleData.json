Two methods used for making the fiber tip: the heating and pulling method and the etching method, are evaluated and compared. The differences between RSNOM and SNOM in transmission mode are also analyzed. The RSNOM was also used to observe a metallic grating which showed that the resolution is near the diffraction limit.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "242", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "245", "date_publication": "Sept. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "242 - 245"}, "authors": ["Wang Gang", "Zhao Jun", "Zhang Peilin"], "keywords": ["Microscopy", "Optical fibers", "Optical imaging", "Optical microscopy", "Optical reflection", "Probes", "near-field", "optical microscope", "reflection mode", "scanning probe", ""], "arnumber": "6077889"}
