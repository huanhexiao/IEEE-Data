A new method is applied to find nonlinear switching surface in deriving the control strategy. The responses to various large perturbation are simulated. The simulation results show that the nonlinear VSC technique for integrated control systems can considerably improve the transient stabilization limitation of power systems and improve the dynamic properties of the generators.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "300", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "304", "date_publication": "Sept. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "300 - 304"}, "authors": ["Han Yunrui"], "keywords": ["Equations", "Mathematical model", "Power system stability", "Switches", "Transient analysis", "equivalent control", "excitation", "fast valve", "power system", "switching surface", "transient stabilization Iimitation", "variable structure control system", ""], "arnumber": "6077903"}
