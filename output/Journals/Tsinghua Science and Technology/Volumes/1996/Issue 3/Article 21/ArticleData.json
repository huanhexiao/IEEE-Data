Since the structure of U-shaped below is complex, numerical methods are often used to calculate mechanical parameters such as stiffness, displacement, etc. In this paper approximate formulas are derived for calculating the stiffness and the stresses of a U-shaped bellows with a slender ring shell. These formulas can be used for designing bellows and selecting corrugation parameters. Camparison between the results of the approximate caculation and a finite element calculation showed that the approximate formulas are applicable for \u03bc< 0.5.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "305", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "309", "date_publication": "Sept. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "305 - 309"}, "authors": ["Shen Zupei"], "keywords": ["Bellows", "Educational institutions", "Equations", "Finite element methods", "Force", "Mathematical model", "Stress", "approximate calculation", "bellows", "stiffness", "toroidal shell", ""], "arnumber": "6077904"}
