The computing process contains two sections. The first section uses the GE (group explicit) method with high parallelism to solve the velocity equations. The second section solves the pressure equation on by a successive underrelaxtion iteration method in red-black order. Results are given using these methods on a parallel computer. Until recently GE method has rarely been used to solve the Navier-Stokes equations.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "295", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "299", "date_publication": "Sept. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "295 - 299"}, "authors": ["Chen Jingliang", "Gu Sheng"], "keywords": ["Boundary conditions", "Computers", "Equations", "Finite difference methods", "Navier-Stokes equations", "Solids", "GE method", "Navier-Stokes equations", "parallel computation", "viscous incompressible flow", ""], "arnumber": "6077902"}
