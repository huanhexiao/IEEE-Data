The nonresonant background in CARS has been effectively suppressed and the vibration mode of these double bonds can be clearly resolved. The spectral features are discussed in terms of the characteristic group frequency and analogies with spectra of molecules with related structures. These spectral feature may be of use for studying biomolecules of unknown composition.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "246", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "249", "date_publication": "Sept. 1996", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1996", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "246 - 249"}, "authors": ["Zhao Shuoyan", "Han Liqun", "Zhou Yidong", "Zhang Peilin"], "keywords": ["Laser beams", "Laser excitation", "Nuclear measurements", "Raman scattering", "Sensitivity", "Vibration measurement", "Vibrations", "nucleioside", "polarization sensitive CARS", "vibrational structure", ""], "arnumber": "6077890"}
