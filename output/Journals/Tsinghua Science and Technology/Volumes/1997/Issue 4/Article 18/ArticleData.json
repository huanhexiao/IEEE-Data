Using the nodal admittance matrix, formulae are developed for the resistances, and self and mutual inductances of the equivalent circuit. Calculated results are given. The method reduces internal memory requirement, allows easy formation of the nodal admittance matrix, reduces computational time, etc.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "838", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "841", "date_publication": "Dec. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "838 - 841"}, "authors": ["Yang Xuechang", "Wang Yongping", "Qi Qingcheng"], "keywords": ["Equivalent circuits", "Inductance", "Lightning", "Power transformer insulation", "Transient analysis", "Windings", "Bergeron's method", "transformer", "transient voltage distribution", ""], "arnumber": "6078087"}
