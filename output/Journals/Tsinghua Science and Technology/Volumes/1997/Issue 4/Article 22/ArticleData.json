Probabilistic neural networks (PNNs) classification of cancer cell image is described. This networks is simpler and faster than back-propagating neural networks (BPNNs) during training and learning. Neural networks combined with expert experience is presented in order to improve the classification accuracy of the networks and the simulation experiments were performed and the results have shown that the method presented is very efficient and feasible.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "853", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "855", "date_publication": "Dec. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "853 - 855"}, "authors": ["Shi Kuifan", "Olen Yuehui", "Dong Jiwen"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Biological neural networks", "Probabilistic logic", "Testing", "Training", "Vectors", "back-propagating neural networks", "cancer cell image", "expert experience", "probabilistic neur al networks", ""], "arnumber": "6078091"}
