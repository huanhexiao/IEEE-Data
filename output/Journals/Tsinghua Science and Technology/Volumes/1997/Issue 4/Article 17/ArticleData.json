The urcertainty in the selection of fixture design schemes necessitates the use of the fuzzy comprehensive judgment method to automatically select an optimal fixture design. This paper reports on the development of a computer aided fixture design system for non-rotational parts using the fuzzy comprehensive judgment method running in an integrated process planning environment. Several typical non-rotational parts with complicated configurations are used to demonstrate the automatic fixture design system.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "833", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "837", "date_publication": "Dec. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "833 - 837"}, "authors": ["Wu Dan", "Wang Xiankui", "Pu Jian"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Clamps", "Computers", "Fixtures", "Machining", "Process planning", "Shape", "computer aided process planning", "fixture design", "fuzzy comprehensive judgment", ""], "arnumber": "6078086"}
