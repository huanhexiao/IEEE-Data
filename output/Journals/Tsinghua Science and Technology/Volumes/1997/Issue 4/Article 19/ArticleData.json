During model building natural or man-made salient color features in the actual environment are picked out and marked on the environment model. During tele-operation, if the co or camera mounted on the tele-operation platform sees some of the modeled color features, the platform orientation can be determined from a single camera view. Correspondence between detected features and model ed features is based on the color attributes and the geometr ic relationships between them. Finally, a simple closed form location calculation for a 4DOF moving camera is given based on the locations of the three feature points.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "842", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "845", "date_publication": "Dec. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "842 - 845"}, "authors": ["Yang Yudong", "Xu Guangyou", "Zeng Jianchao"], "keywords": ["Cameras", "Color", "Feature extraction", "Humans", "Image color analysis", "Solid modeling", "Virtual reality", "color vision", "dynamic calibration", "tele-operation", "virtual reality", ""], "arnumber": "6078088"}
