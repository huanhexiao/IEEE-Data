This first part of a two part series focuses on aging and lifetime evaluation of oil sealed transformers. The second part focuses on an experimental study of the various elements of transformers. A new computational formula based on the degree of polymerization of (DP) of the insulation paper is proposed for lifetime evaluation of transformers.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "824", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "827", "date_publication": "Dec. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "824 - 827"}, "authors": ["Guo Yongji", "Dai Youjie"], "keywords": ["Aging", "Degradation", "Oil insulation", "Polymers", "Power transformer insulation", "degree of polymerization", "lifetime evaluation", "transformer", ""], "arnumber": "6078084"}
