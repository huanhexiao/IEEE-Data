By minimizing the total energy, the body-centered tetragonal lattice structure is shown to be stable under the screened di pole-dipole interaction, while the cubic structure is not. The effectiveness of this model is estimated by simplifying the model to the nearest-neighbor Ising model for evaluating the physical quantities. The results are in qualitative agreement with experimental data. A method is also suggested to verify the results. In addition, the critical temperature of the 3 D-Ising model for body-centered tetragonal crystals is obtained using the Monte Carlo method.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "770", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "773", "date_publication": "Dec. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "770 - 773"}, "authors": ["Guo Youjiang", "Yan Zonglin"], "keywords": ["Crystals", "Electric fields", "Ferroelectric materials", "Fluids", "Lattices", "Monte Carlo methods", "Permittivity", "Ising model", "dipolar lattice", "ferroelectricity", ""], "arnumber": "6078072"}
