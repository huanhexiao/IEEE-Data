Characteristics are detected using color-sensing devices. Test results from both thermal simulation and robotic arc welding are regular and reproducible. The pseudo-color values were found to be directly relative to the seam position and welding penetration, therefore, they could be used for monitoring welding penetration and for seam tracking.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "846", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "849", "date_publication": "Dec. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "846 - 849"}, "authors": ["Wu Minsheng", "Lu Minghui", "Li Luming", "Wang Zhengxian"], "keywords": ["Detectors", "Image color analysis", "Indium gallium arsenide", "Process control", "Temperature", "Temperature measurement", "Welding", "penetration", "pseudo-color method", "seam position", ""], "arnumber": "6078089"}
