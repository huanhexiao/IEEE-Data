By an analysis of the maximum heating point and maximum cooling poi nt of uncertain parameters, existence of pinch jump can be determined. Based on the principle of reduced temperature interval analysis, a sufficient and necessary condition is derived for each stream supply temperature to determine if it is possible to become pinch within the specified range of uncertain parameters, then this range may be partitioned into different pinch regions. The study is a foundation for the flexibility analysis, synthesis, and retrofit of heat exchanger networks.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "777", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "782", "date_publication": "Dec. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "777 - 782"}, "authors": ["Hu Shanying", "Chen Bingzhen", "Shen Jingzhu"], "keywords": ["Chemical engineering", "Cooling", "Heat recovery", "Heat transfer", "Temperature distribution", "Upper bound", "heat exchange", "heat load", "pinch", "temperature interval", "urcertain parameter", ""], "arnumber": "6078074"}
