Electric field effect, magnetic field effect, well width and barrier height effects on resonant-tunneling are studied in detail. It is found that all of these four factors affect the peak-value and peak position of the transmission coefficient. For symmetric double-barrier systems, the wider the well is and the lower the barrier is, the more drastically are peaks reduced by the magnetic field. But for triple-barrier systems, with increasing magnetic field strength, the variation of peak-value exhibits complicated behavior due to the coupling of the quasibound states in two quantum wells of the system.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "759", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "764", "date_publication": "Dec. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "759 - 764"}, "authors": ["Guo Yong", "Gu Binglin", "Zhang Xiangdong", "Duan Wenhui"], "keywords": ["Electric fields", "Electric potential", "Magnetic fields", "Magnetic resonance", "Resonant tunneling devices", "Wave functions", "resonant-tunneling", "symmetry of effective potential", "transmission coefficient", ""], "arnumber": "6078070"}
