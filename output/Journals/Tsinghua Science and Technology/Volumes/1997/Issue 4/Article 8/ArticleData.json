An anion-exchange column and a cation-exchange column were connected in parallel for the measurement. Oxalic acid was employed as a common eluent for both the anion- and cation-exchange columns. Under the same chromatographic conditions, the organic acids and cations can be separated sequentially by a switching operation selecting the path way through the anion-and cation-exchange columns. This method is simple to operate and is very sensitive with detection limits of 0. 1 1. 0 mg/L for organic acids and 10 ~ 20 \u03bcg/L for cations.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "793", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "797", "date_publication": "Dec. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "793 - 797"}, "authors": ["Ding Mingyu", "Koizumi Hitoshi", "Suzuki Yoshihito"], "keywords": ["Detectors", "Earth", "Ions", "Metals", "Silicon carbide", "Switches", "Valves", "alcoholic drink", "cation", "column switching method", "ion chromatography", "organic acid", ""], "arnumber": "6078077"}
