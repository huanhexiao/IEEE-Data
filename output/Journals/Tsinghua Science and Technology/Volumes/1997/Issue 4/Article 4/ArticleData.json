In order to analyse the mechanism for the motor's function, A linear ultrasonic self-correcting stepping motor is designed, and the dynamics of the motor was studied. For clarification, a set of experiment device was also designed, the calculated results were consistent with the experimental ones.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "774", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "776", "date_publication": "Dec. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "774 - 776"}, "authors": ["Zhang Qiang", "Zhou Tieying"], "keywords": ["Acoustics", "Force", "Friction", "Joining processes", "Rotors", "Stators", "Ultrasonic variables measurement", "restoration force", "self-correcting", "ultrasonic stepping motor", ""], "arnumber": "6078073"}
