The proposed method generates a set of residual sequences from the system input and measured output using an adaptive bi-channel lattice filter. The fault detection is carried out by performing statistical tests on the residuals. The distinctive advantage of this method is that a model of the unknown system is not required a priori for the purpose of fault detection. An application of this approach in a practical control system has been implemented, and satisfactory results have been obtained.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "814", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "818", "date_publication": "Dec. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "814 - 818"}, "authors": ["Xiao Deyun", "Li Weihua"], "keywords": ["Adaptive filters", "Adaptive systems", "Fault detection", "Lattices", "Mathematical model", "Maximum likelihood detection", "Noise measurement", "adaptive lattice filter", "fault detection", "hypothesis testing", ""], "arnumber": "6078082"}
