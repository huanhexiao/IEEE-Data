The model includes 3000 (150 \u00d7 20) rigid particles. The 12\u20136 Lennard-Jones potential was used to describe the interactions among argon particles. Periodic boundary conditions were employed at the upper and bottom sides, and rigid boundary was used at right side. The thermal perturbations were generated by increasing the kinetic energy of the first five particle layers on the left side. Simulation results demonstrated that heat was transported by diffusion, and even at early time of fast transient heat transfer process, no wave phenomena such as wave front and wave reflection were observed. For a fast and large thermal perturbation propagation, wave-like temperature profiles could be seen, which were always associated with the pressure waves rather than the heat waves in the sense of C-V model.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "613", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "618", "date_publication": "June 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "613 - 618"}, "authors": ["Guo Zengyuan", "Xiong Daxi", "Li Zhixin"], "keywords": ["Argon", "Equations", "Heat transfer", "Heating", "Mathematical model", "Transient analysis", "heat diffusion", "heat wave", "molecular dynamics simulation", ""], "arnumber": "6078062"}
