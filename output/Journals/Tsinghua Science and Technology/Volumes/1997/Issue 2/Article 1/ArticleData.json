This solution shows that the near-tip stresses and strains are fully continuous and bounded, and dependonly on one free parameter that must be determined from the far-field.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "519", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "522", "date_publication": "June 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "519 - 522"}, "authors": ["Zhu Xiankui", "Hwang Kehchih"], "keywords": ["Boundary conditions", "Equations", "Plastics", "Solids", "Strain", "Stress", "asymptotic solution", "dynamic crack", "near-tip field", "power-law solid", "steady growth", ""], "arnumber": "6078043"}
