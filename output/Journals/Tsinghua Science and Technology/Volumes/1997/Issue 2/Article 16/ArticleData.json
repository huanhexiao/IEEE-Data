The open boundary condition and the numerical method in solving Poisson equation of pressure are described in detail. Two different examples are displayed. The results show that the disturbance at entry can be used to control the vortex structure in mixing layer.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "593", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "598", "date_publication": "June 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "593 - 598"}, "authors": ["Su Mingde"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Boundary conditions", "Computer aided software engineering", "Equations", "Mathematical model", "Numerical simulation", "Poisson equations", "direct numerical simulation", "incompressible flow", "mixing layer", ""], "arnumber": "6078058"}
