Based on this new continuity equation, a penalized numerical formulation of finite element method is given. Computational result shows that this new biphasic mixture model can provide better description of the transient response of biological media such as articular cartilage, muscle, and soft tissue.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "548", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "552", "date_publication": "June 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "548 - 552"}, "authors": ["Lu Mingwan", "Huang Dongtao", "Xue Weimin", "Y.
