The appendage is modeled as a finite deflection beam having linear constitutive equations. By taking the energy integral as Lyapunov function, it is proved that nonlinear transverse vibrations of the beam undergoing uniform extension or retrieval are stable when there are not controlling moment in the central rigid body and driving force on the beam, according to the partial stable theorem.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "545", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "547", "date_publication": "June 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "545 - 547"}, "authors": ["Li Junfeng", "Wang Zhaolin"], "keywords": ["Equations", "Force", "Mathematical model", "Space vehicles", "Stability analysis", "Vectors", "Vibrations", "deploying flexible beam", "partial stability", "rigid-flexible coupled system", ""], "arnumber": "6078048"}
