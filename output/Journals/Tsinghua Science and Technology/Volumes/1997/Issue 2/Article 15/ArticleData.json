This method is based on the aerodynamic model proposed by Etkin. His model is analyzed and generalized. After giving the specific forms of the aerodynamic model, the dynamic stability parameters are determined by the unsteady flow field computation and a parameter identification technique. Numerical experiments show that this method is accurate in predicting the dynamic stability characteristics of blunt cones in hypersonic flight.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "587", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "592", "date_publication": "June 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "587 - 592"}, "authors": ["Liu Qiusheng", "Ren Yuxin", "Shen Mengyu"], "keywords": ["Aerodynamics", "Aircraft", "Atmospheric modeling", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Numerical stability", "Stability analysis", "aerodynamic model", "dynamic stability parameters", "high order stability parameters", "high reduced frequency", ""], "arnumber": "6078057"}
