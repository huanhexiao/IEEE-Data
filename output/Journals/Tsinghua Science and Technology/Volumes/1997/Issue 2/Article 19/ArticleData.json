In order to determine the correct boundary conditions at the tube inlet, the computational domain is extended to include both the circular tube and the arc plasma torch. Computational results show that the gas static-pressure in the tube increases at first and then decreases slowly, while the heat flux to the tube wall decreases monotonically with increasing distance from the tube inlet. Comparison of some computed results with corresponding experimental data is also given.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "608", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "612", "date_publication": "June 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "608 - 612"}, "authors": ["Chen Xi", "Su Bingzhi"], "keywords": ["Argon", "Boundary conditions", "Electron tubes", "Heat transfer", "Heating", "Plasma temperature", "arc plasma torch", "laminar flow", "plasma heat transfer", ""], "arnumber": "6078061"}
