The weak generated ultrasonic signal of nanosecond duration and nanometer amplitude can be detected with a confocal Fabry-Perot interferometer (CFPI). It can be applied to determination of elastic constants of material and flaw detection. The experimental results show that laserultrasonic technique is practical and effective.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "578", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "582", "date_publication": "June 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "578 - 582"}, "authors": ["Zhou Xingeng", "He Cunfu"], "keywords": ["Acoustics", "Laser beams", "Measurement by laser beam", "Mirrors", "Surface waves", "Ultrasonic imaging", "Ultrasonic variables measurement", "elastic constants", "flaw detection", "laser ultrasonics", "non-destructive testing", ""], "arnumber": "6078055"}
