It is applicable to the eigenfrequency and geometric nonlinear dynamic response analysis of three-dimensional beam structures. It is pointed out that both the generalized elastic coefficient matrix of the flexible connector and the mass matrix of discrete element may be off-diagonal in a general case. A special discrete element, zero-length rigid element, is introduced to simulate the node at which multiple elements are jointed together. It may also be efficient when the axes of adjacent elements are not in the same line. The formulation of stiffness matrix is established while nonlinearity is taken into consideration. Given examples show that the model is successful in eigenvalue calculation and geometric nonlinear response analysis.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "529", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "535", "date_publication": "June 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "529 - 535"}, "authors": ["Cheng Baorong", "Hou Zhichao", "Zheng Zhaochang"], "keywords": ["Analytical models", "Connectors", "Finite element methods", "Mathematical model", "Springs", "Transmission line matrix methods", "Vectors", "discrete element", "dynamic analysis", "flexible connector", "geometric nonlinearity", "rigid element with zero length", "spatial beam structure", ""], "arnumber": "6078045"}
