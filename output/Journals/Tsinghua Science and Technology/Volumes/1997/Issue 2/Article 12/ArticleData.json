The evolution of the surface morphology induces fluctuations in electric field. When the surface diffusivity is inhomogeneous, surface damage appears under electric current as a combination of stationary solution and transients. The experimental observations confirm the above theoretical predictions and raise the reliability issue of electromigration in polycrystalline interconnects.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "574", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "577", "date_publication": "June 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "574 - 577"}, "authors": ["Zhao Zhijun", "Yang Wei"], "keywords": ["Aluminum", "Electric fields", "Electromigration", "Integrated circuit interconnections", "Surface morphology", "Surface waves", "Transient analysis", "electromigration", "surface evolution", "thin film interconnect", ""], "arnumber": "6078054"}
