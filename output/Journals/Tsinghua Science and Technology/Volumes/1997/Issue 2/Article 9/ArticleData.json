As compared with similar standards in other countries, there are some features in elastic-plastic analysis of pressure vessels and their components in JB4732. Three of them are introduced in brief. It includes: flat head design methodconsidering plastic carrying capactities of structures; a reinforcement design method based on limit analysis of spherical shells with nozzles and the calculation method of stress concentration factors of two intersecting cylindrical shells with d/D 0.7 based on an analytical solution.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "558", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "563", "date_publication": "June 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "558 - 563"}, "authors": ["Xue Mingde"], "keywords": ["Design methodology", "Electron tubes", "Equations", "Junctions", "Mathematical model", "Plastics", "Stress", "design code by analysis", "elastic-plastic analysis", "limit analysis", "pressure vessel", "thin shell theory", ""], "arnumber": "6078051"}
