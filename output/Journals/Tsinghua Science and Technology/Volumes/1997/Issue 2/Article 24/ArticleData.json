Based on the concept of interactors, an interacting model for the effective elastic properties of anisotropically damaged solids is proposed. As an application of the proposed model, the anisotropic effective elastic properties of anisotropic matrix material with circular holes in periodically rectangular distribution are theoretically estimated up to third-order terms of the porosity and the estimation is compared with numerical results.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "633", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "640", "date_publication": "June 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "633 - 640"}, "authors": ["Gao Yunxin", "Zheng Quanshui", "Yu Shouwen"], "keywords": ["Estimation", "Indexes", "Numerical models", "Solids", "Tensile stress", "anisotropy", "effective elastic property", "interacting model", "interactor", ""], "arnumber": "6078066"}
