In this way, the effective mechanical properties can be related quantitatively to the micro structures of the composites. For the optimal design, the geometric parameters are considered as design variables, and the effective elastic and plastic properties as optimal target functi ons. The effects of fiber shape and distribution on the effective elastic and plastic properties are examined. The numerical results indicate that the overall transverse properties are rather sensitive to fiber geometric parameters.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "539", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "544", "date_publication": "June 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "539 - 544"}, "authors": ["Fang Daining", "Qi Hang", "Liu Tieqi"], "keywords": ["Loading", "Optical fiber theory", "Plastics", "Shape", "Strain", "Stress", "elastoplastic property", "fibrous composite", "micro structure", "optimization", ""], "arnumber": "6078047"}
