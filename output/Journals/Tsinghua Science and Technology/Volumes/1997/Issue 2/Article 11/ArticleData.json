Research results indicate that GA favours complex problems including inversion without borehole data constraint and inversion of data with low signal/noise ratio. The analyses of its stability and its sensibility to noise show that GA is quite noise resistant. GA is initially used in interval velocity inversion of seismic data and displays its potentiality in seismic data processing.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "568", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "573", "date_publication": "June 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "568 - 573"}, "authors": ["Zhang Houzhu", "Yang Huizhu", "Xu Bingye"], "keywords": ["Accuracy", "Biological cells", "Convolution", "Genetic algorithms", "Interpolation", "Media", "Noise", "genetic algorithm", "interval velocity", "inversion", ""], "arnumber": "6078053"}
