This paper presents the experimental reserch on infrared thermal waving which can be used to measure thermal diffusivity and local heat transfer coefficient of thin materials. Numerical modeling of subsurface defect detecting is also performed for pulse-echo thermal wave imaging.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "619", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "623", "date_publication": "June 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "619 - 623"}, "authors": ["He Dongming", "Zhu Dezhong", "Gu Yuqin"], "keywords": ["Heat transfer", "Heating", "Imaging", "Materials", "Photothermal effects", "Surface waves", "Temperature measurement", "nondestructive evaluation", "numerical modeling", "thermal diffusivity", "thermal wave imaging", ""], "arnumber": "6078063"}
