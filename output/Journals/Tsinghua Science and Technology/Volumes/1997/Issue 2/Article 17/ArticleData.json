Due to the vapor condensation, the formation and collapse of cavity are transient and of two-phase character. In order to simulate the process of cavity formation and collapse, a physical model is suggested. In the model, the cavity boundary is treated as free surface of a calculating field. A numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equation is obtained by using a modified VOF (volume of fluid) method, in which the vapor condensation is considered. With the method, formation and collapse of the cavity are described, and the highest pressure is acquired. The numerical simulation results coincide with experimental results.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "599", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "602", "date_publication": "June 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "599 - 602"}, "authors": ["Yao Zhaohui", "Zhang Xiwen", "Wang Xuefang"], "keywords": ["Cavity resonators", "Electron tubes", "Equations", "Fluids", "Mathematical model", "Numerical models", "Numerical simulation", "cavity collapse", "condensation-induced water-hammer", "modified VOF method", "numerical simulation", ""], "arnumber": "6078059"}
