Individual Ag-NORs sizes var ied on different chromosomes, and the number of Ag-NOR per cell varied from three to six. Arrong the gnomes ned 100 cells, 71% of the gnomes carried four Ag-IDRs, 12% carried 3, 11% carried 5, and 6% occurred 6. The variance occurred not only among different cells but also among different cells from the same soiree. The satellite ite association between horrologous chromosomes in No 7 was also observed in 27% of the metaphase chromosome preparations. The heteromorphic properties es of Ag-NORs were discussed.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "447", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "451", "date_publication": "March 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "447 - 451"}, "authors": ["Fu Lijuan"], "keywords": ["Biological cells", "Genomics", "Humans", "Marine animals", "Satellites", "Silver", "fish", "heteromorphism", "metaphase chromosome", "nucleolus organizer region", "satellite association", ""], "arnumber": "6077817"}
