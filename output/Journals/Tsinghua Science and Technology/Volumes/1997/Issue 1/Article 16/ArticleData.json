It is shown that some irreversible conformational changes of HFG, including a decrease in the\u03b2structure content, were induced by the PTFE surface adsorption/desorption. This suggests that some \u03b1-helix structures should transform into \u03b2-structures. Oesorbed HFG was thermally denatured as well as the native HFG under a thermal incubation of 30 min at 73 After the sarre thermal treatrrent, the\u03b1x00AB;-helix content in the therrrally denatured desorbed HFG was obviously less than that in the former native HFG.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "499", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "503", "date_publication": "March 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "499 - 503"}, "authors": ["Zhao Nanming", "Gong Yandao", "Li Fei", "Hang Xiufang"], "keywords": ["Deconvolution", "Films", "Humans", "Protein engineering", "Proteins", "Surface treatment", "Thermal stability", "adsorption/desorption", "human fibrinogen (HFG)", "polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)", "thermal denaturation", ""], "arnumber": "6077829"}
