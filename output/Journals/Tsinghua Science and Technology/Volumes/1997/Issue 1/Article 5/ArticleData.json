The rTipl was expressed in shoots and roots of rice seedlings and induced by water stress, salt stress and exogenous ABA. The rM pI was expressed only in rice shoots. Although the mRNA level of rMipl in the shoots was induced to a small extent by exogenous ABA, it did not show any increase under water or salt stress within the course of 12h. On the basis of the different expression patterns and evolutionary distirctions of the above Mips, it is suggested that the possible Mip channel protei ns encoded by the rTipl and rMipl genes may function in different transport systems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "452", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "459", "date_publication": "March 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "452 - 459"}, "authors": ["Zhou Zhiqi", "Liu Qiang", "Kazuko Yamaguchi Shinozaki", "Hirofumi Uchimiya"], "keywords": ["Amino acids", "Biomembranes", "Libraries", "Plasmas", "Proteins", "RNA", "Stress", "channel protein", "expression", "major intrinsic protein", "rice", "tonoplast intrinsic protein", ""], "arnumber": "6077818"}
