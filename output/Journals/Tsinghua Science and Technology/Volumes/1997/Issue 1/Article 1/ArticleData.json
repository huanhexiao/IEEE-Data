The results indicated that H9, Paji and U937 cells all expressed IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-receptor on their cell surfaces and the Paji cells showed the highest I evel of expression. The flow cytometry analysis using the antiserum to human IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-receptor more clearly showed a strong IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-receptor expression on Raj i cells and a weak expression H9 and U937 cells. These resul ts indicate that B cells (Raji) expressed rrore receptor rrolecul es on their cell surface than on T cells (r9) and on monocytes (U37), and the number of receptor molecules expressed on the cells is enough to be measured with flow cytometry.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "433", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "436", "date_publication": "March 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "433 - 436"}, "authors": ["Chen Yinghua", "Wu Weicheng", "Xiao Yi", "Zhao Yingxu", "Yu Tianwei", "Manfred P.
