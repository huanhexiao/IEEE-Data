The disease resistance for both varieties was verified to be stable in three generations. The transcription activities of five piant defense response genes, pr \u22121a, chi, chs, pal, and lox, in NC89, NC89-V1, and NC89-V2 were studied through RNA blot hybridization. Genome DNA structural differences among the three tobacco lines were identified using rardorrty amplified poly morphic DNA (RAPD).", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "463", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "465", "date_publication": "March 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "463 - 465"}, "authors": ["Xu Wenlian", "Dong Hansong", "Pan Jun", "Jiang Wuling", "Liu Aixin", "Duan Mingxing"], "keywords": ["Bioinformatics", "Diseases", "Immune system", "Laboratories", "Presses", "RNA", "Strain", "defense gene", "induced disease resistance", "molecular basis", ""], "arnumber": "6077820"}
