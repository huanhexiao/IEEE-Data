An NMR analytical of the tri chosanthin solution conf or rration is made to study the structural-functional reiationship of this protein. For preparing a sample labled with 15N, the tcs gene was cloned into the expression vector pQE-30, and produced a high level expression of trichosanthin in the E. colistrain M15 [pREP4]. The amount of fusion TCS synthesized in E. coli was about 6.4% of the total cellular protein. The fusion protein was purified by using affinity chromatography with Ni-NTA resin.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "469", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "471", "date_publication": "March 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "469 - 471"}, "authors": ["Liu Yue", "Zhu Chunming", "Ye Zhaohui", "Liu Jinyuan", "Zhang Riqing"], "keywords": ["Cloning", "Nuclear magnetic resonance", "Proteins", "Purification", "Resins", "Vectors", "fusion protein", "high level expression", "trichosanthin", ""], "arnumber": "6077822"}
