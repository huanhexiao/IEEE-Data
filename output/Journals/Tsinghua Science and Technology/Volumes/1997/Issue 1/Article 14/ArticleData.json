The recognition and the binding principles of CRP to its substrates are not well known. Inthis paper the interaction of rabbit CRP (rCRP) with lipid monolayers at the air/ water interface was studied. Fromthe experiments it was concluded that rCRP molecules were amphipathic, and rCRP molecules might interact with phospholipid monolayer s by hydrophobic force. The critical surface pressure of rCRP interacting with phospholipid monolayers is about 34. 5mN/m.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "491", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "493", "date_publication": "March 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "491 - 493"}, "authors": ["Xiao Caide", "Sui Senfang"], "keywords": ["Lipidomics", "Manganese", "Pressure measurement", "Proteins", "Rabbits", "Substrates", "Surface treatment", "C-reactive protein", "critical pressure", "phospholipid monolayer", ""], "arnumber": "6077827"}
