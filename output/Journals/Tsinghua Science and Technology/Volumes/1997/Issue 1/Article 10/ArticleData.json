For corrparison, solution on fluorescence (SF) spectra of native, thermally denatured, urea-denatured FG solution with FG desorbed from a glass surface and the SSF spectra of native FG powder were recorded. To analyze the structural changes induced by the surface adsorption, all the aqueous samples mentioned above were analyzed by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The results derronstrated that the structural changes of FG induced by glass adsorption caused changes in the spectroscopic features of the SSF spectra, especially in the excitation (EX) spectra It is suggested that SSF spectroscopy rray be a useful tool for studying the structures of surface/ interface biomolecules and for evaluating the biocompatibility of biomaterials.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "472", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "477", "date_publication": "March 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "March 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "472 - 477"}, "authors": ["Gong Yandao", "Ding Xiaolan", "Du Peicheng", "Zhang Xiufang", "Zhao Nanming"], "keywords": ["Chemicals", "Fluorescence", "Glass", "Powders", "Proteins", "Spectroscopy", "Surface treatment", "fibrinogen (FG)", "glass surface adsorption", "solid surface fluorescence (SSF) spectroscopy", "structure of surface/interface biomolecules", ""], "arnumber": "6077823"}
