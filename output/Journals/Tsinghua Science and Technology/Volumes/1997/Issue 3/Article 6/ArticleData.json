Damage propagation in rock mass, found from rock sample tests was described in terms of fractal elements. This paper uses fractal dimension analysis to describe the fractures in rock mass. Fractal geometry is proposed as a novel method to predict propagation of damage in rock.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "666", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "669", "date_publication": "Sept. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "666 - 669"}, "authors": ["Zhou Weiyuan", "Yan Gongrui"], "keywords": ["Fractals", "Joints", "Materials", "Rocks", "Tensile stress", "damage fracture", "fractal", "propagation", "rock mass joints", ""], "arnumber": "6078348"}
