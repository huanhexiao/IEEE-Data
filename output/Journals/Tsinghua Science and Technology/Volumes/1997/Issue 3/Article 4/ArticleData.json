To avoid these singular cases, the finite truncate condition is proposed. When the finite truncate condition is satisfied, the positive definiteness of an analytic function can be judged by the partial sum of its Taylor series, i. e., by a polynomial. This discussion will be useful in the construction of Lyapunov functions for nonlinear systems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "657", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "660", "date_publication": "Sept. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "657 - 660"}, "authors": ["Miao Yuan", "Li Chunwen", "Zhang Ping"], "keywords": ["Asymptotic stability", "Educational institutions", "Lyapunov methods", "Nonlinear systems", "Polynomials", "Stability analysis", "Taylor series", "finite truncate condition", "polynomial", "positive definte", ""], "arnumber": "6078346"}
