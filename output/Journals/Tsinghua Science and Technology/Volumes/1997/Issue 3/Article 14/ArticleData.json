In this model the casing is fixed but the effects of stiffness and damping of the rotor are considered. The numerical results show the existence of the phenomenon of period doubling to chaos and then to inverse period doubling. Chaotic motions are indicated by Liapunov exponents.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "703", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "706", "date_publication": "Sept. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "703 - 706"}, "authors": ["Wu Xianfang", "Wang Duo", "Zhang Xiaozhang"], "keywords": ["Bifurcation", "Chaos", "Damping", "Mathematical model", "Orbits", "Rotors", "Vectors", "Liapunov exponent", "chaos", "period doubling bifurcation", "rotor-casing system", ""], "arnumber": "6078356"}
