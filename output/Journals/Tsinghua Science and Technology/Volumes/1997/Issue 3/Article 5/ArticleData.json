The new results are described by introducing the normal positivity. The article analyzes the relationship of a general system and a polynomial system, the judgment and measurement of positive definiteness, the polar coordinate approach, and constructing the algorithms for positive definite v(x). Therefore, a new and systematic theory on stability judgment is clearly described.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "661", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "665", "date_publication": "Sept. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "661 - 665"}, "authors": ["Li Chunwen", "Du Jihong", "Hu Shiwen", "Miao Yuan"], "keywords": ["Asymptotic stability", "Indexes", "Polynomials", "Stability criteria", "Taylor series", "Lyapunov method", "definite sign derivative function approach", "minimum function", "nonlinear", "stability", ""], "arnumber": "6078347"}
