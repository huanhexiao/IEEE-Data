All the elementary waves are classified into incoming and outgoing waves under the assumption that there is a singular point in the configuration of the solution. The interactions of at most two incoming waves are dealt with in this paper, and all six kinds of configurations for the solutions are obtained. They are the Mach reflection (one kind), the shock wave S transmits contact discontinuity J(two kinds), the overtaking of two incoming shock waves (two kinds), and the collision of two incoming shock waves (one kind).", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "747", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "751", "date_publication": "Sept. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "747 - 751"}, "authors": ["Hu Zhiming", "Zhang Tong"], "keywords": ["Diffraction", "Electric shock", "Fluids", "Reflection", "Shock waves", "Vectors", "Mach reflection", "interaction of waves", "rarefaction wave", "shock wave", ""], "arnumber": "6078365"}
