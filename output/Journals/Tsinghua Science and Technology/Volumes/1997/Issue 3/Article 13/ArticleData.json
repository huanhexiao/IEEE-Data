The results show that the rotor does not become unstable even under large amplitude vibration and impact with the boundary. Also an intermittent impact phenomenon is observed. The experiment supports the viewpoint that in some situations, the impact of a rotor with its boundary is not harmful to the rotor operation; it may even suppress excessive rotor vibration. The experiment also shows that the phenomenon is complicated and nonl inear.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "700", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "702", "date_publication": "Sept. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "700 - 702"}, "authors": ["Zhang Xiaozhang", "Dai Xingjian", "Liu Ping"], "keywords": ["Current measurement", "Electromagnetics", "Extraterrestrial measurements", "Orbits", "Rotors", "Transducers", "Vibrations", "boundary", "impact", "rotor", "rub", "vibration", ""], "arnumber": "6078355"}
