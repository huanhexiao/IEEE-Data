The model represents a natural way to describe input-output nonliear systems. A combined parameter off-line estimation and structure detection algorithm is developed that can use an initial set of data. Then, an efficient model is obtained using orthogonal estimation with an error reduction test and other monitoring modifications. A recursive on-line identification scheme is established based on the ELS algorithm to account for future time-variations in the process of the parsimonious model.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "730", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "733", "date_publication": "Sept. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "730 - 733"}, "authors": ["Luo Guiming"], "keywords": ["Adaptation models", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Mathematical model", "Nonlinear systems", "Parameter estimation", "Stochastic systems", "Vectors", "ELS algorithm", "error reduction test", "nonlinear systems", "parameter estimation", "structure selection", ""], "arnumber": "6078361"}
