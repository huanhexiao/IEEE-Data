These kinds of systems, which have both the self-organization on phenomena of natural systems and the organization of man-made systems, are called complex systems with human participation (CSHP). The mechanism of control for CSHP is essentially the self-organization/organization cooperation. This paper discusses the concept of CSHP and the mechanism and patterns of control for CSHP. Finally, a case study of control for transportation systems, the typical CSHP, is given to properly illustrate the mechanism and the serial pattern of control for CSHP.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "641", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "645", "date_publication": "Sept. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "641 - 645"}, "authors": ["Yang Jiaben"], "keywords": ["Aerospace electronics", "Equations", "Humans", "Mathematical model", "Organizations", "Vehicles", "complex systems with human participation", "organization", "self-organization", "self-organization/organization cooperation", ""], "arnumber": "6078343"}
