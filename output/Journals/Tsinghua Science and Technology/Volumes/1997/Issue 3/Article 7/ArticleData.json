The effects of the intersection position, image averaging and threshold setting on the fractal dimension are investigated in detail. Results illustrate that a jet into a crossflow also behaves with the fractal characteristics. Compared with a free axisymmetric jet, the jet into the crossflow has stronger anisotropy, resulting in a fractal dimension varying with the momentum ratio.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "670", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "673", "date_publication": "Sept. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "670 - 673"}, "authors": ["Li Yuliang", "Chen Chaoquan", "Zhou Xueyi", "Yu Changzhao"], "keywords": ["Anisotropic magnetoresistance", "Fluids", "Fractals", "Image processing", "Noise", "Silicon", "Stability analysis", "PLIF", "crossflow", "fractal dimension", "image processing", "jet", ""], "arnumber": "6078349"}
