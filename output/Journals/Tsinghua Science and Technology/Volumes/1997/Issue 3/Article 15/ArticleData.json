Besides the nodes on the middle surface, additional virtual nodes are used to determine the normal to the middle surface. There are three displacement d. o. f. for each node of the element, and two transverse shear strains are taken as additional independent d. o. f. for each node on the middle surface. Therefore, the element is suitable for large rotation analysis of plates and shells. It can also be easily applied to the analysis of laminated and sandwich shell s and plates. Numerical examples are given to show the accuracy and efficiency of the element.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "707", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "712", "date_publication": "Sept. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "707 - 712"}, "authors": ["Yao Zhenhan", "Qi Hang", "Fu Minghui", "Yao Jianjun"], "keywords": ["Equations", "Finite element methods", "Interpolation", "Loading", "Strain", "Tensile stress", "Vectors", "finite element", "geometric nonlinear analysis", "large rotation", "plate and shell", ""], "arnumber": "6078357"}
