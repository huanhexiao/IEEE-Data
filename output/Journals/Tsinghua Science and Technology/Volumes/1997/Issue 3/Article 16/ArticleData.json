The schemes employ a fuzzy controller and a compensation controller. The parameters of the fuzzy controller are on-line adjusted according to an adaptive law while the identification of the controlled plant is unnecessary. It is proved that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable based on the Lyapunov synthesis approach. Finally, these schemes are applied to control a chaotic system.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "713", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "718", "date_publication": "Sept. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "713 - 718"}, "authors": ["Tang Yuezhong", "Zhang Naiyao", "Li Yanda"], "keywords": ["Adaptive systems", "Fuzzy logic", "Fuzzy sets", "Stability analysis", "Trajectory", "Vectors", "compensation control", "control stability", "fuzzy logic system", "nonlinear control", ""], "arnumber": "6078358"}
