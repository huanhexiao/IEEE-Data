A mathematical model is designed to simulate the flow in the water-sand region and the bedform processes. The model results in a free boundary problem. Features of the free boundary problem are given. Explicit solutions as well as their physical implications for a few special cases of the free boundary problem are presented.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "752", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "754", "date_publication": "Sept. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "752 - 754"}, "authors": ["Li Shuanhu", "Yang Tiesheng"], "keywords": ["Entropy", "Geometry", "Grain size", "Mathematical model", "Rivers", "Sediments", "bedform evolution", "entropy solution", "free boundary problem", ""], "arnumber": "6078366"}
