Specifically, it deals with chaotic systems which are synchronous and capable of exchanging information back and forth. In this context, the concept of \u201cmutual perturbability\u201d is used. If the change in only one part of the system results in change in another part but not vice versa, this aspect of the organization is termed the \u201cmaster-slave\u201d type. If the change is mutual, the organization is designated \u201cmutually perturbable\u201d. To begin with the analysis, the systems are coupled in the following manner: a signal from the first of these systems, representing a state variable of the system, is sent to the other system and overrides the corresponding variable. Similarly, a signal from the second system arrives at the first system and overrides another variable. The conditions under which the remainder of the state variables can synchronize with one another are examined, in spite of being chaotic and having different initial conditions. It turns out that in some specific cases, it is possible to perturb either of the two systems by altering the other. Due to this coequal status, the term \u201cmutually perturbable synchronization\u201d (as opposed to the earlier \u201cmaster-slave\u201d) is used to describe this phenomenon. Not all the multiple coupled systems show this phenomenon. Examples of both possibilities are given.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "687", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "693", "date_publication": "Sept. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "687 - 693"}, "authors": ["P.
