A new kind of PDE (partial differential equntion) problem is proposed to explain such phenomena as the transition of fluid in layered porous media. The characteristic of these problems is that across the interface between the two layers, the flux is conserved, but the fluid content in general is different. This situation is very different from the model of filtration in homogeneous porous media, in which the primary objective is to maintain fluid continuity.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "727", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "729", "date_publication": "Sept. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "727 - 729"}, "authors": ["Song Binheng"], "keywords": ["Equations", "Filtration", "Fluids", "Gold", "Mathematical model", "Media", "layered filtration", "porous medium", "semigroup", ""], "arnumber": "6078360"}
