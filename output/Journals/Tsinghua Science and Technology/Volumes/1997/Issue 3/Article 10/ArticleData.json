The reconstruction of the Lorenz system is studied and it is found that one specific parameter of the Lorenz system can be quickly obtained by a simple formula if the other two parameters are already known.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "682", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "686", "date_publication": "Sept. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "682 - 686"}, "authors": ["He Rong", "P.
