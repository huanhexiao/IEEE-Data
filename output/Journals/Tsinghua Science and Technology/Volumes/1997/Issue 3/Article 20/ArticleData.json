A recursive identification on-line algorithm is implemented to track the nonlinear time variable process. The ELS algorithm is proposed for the parameters, and the nonlinear adaptive controller is designed by the ELS algorithm. The convergence rate of the parameter estimation and the adaptive are tracking are established.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "734", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "736", "date_publication": "Sept. 1997", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Sept. 1997", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 17 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "734 - 736"}, "authors": ["Luo Guiming"], "keywords": ["Adaptation models", "Adaptive control", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Convergence", "Heuristic algorithms", "Nonlinear systems", "Parameter estimation", "ELS algorithm", "adaptive control", "convergerce rate", "nonlinear stochastic system", ""], "arnumber": "6078362"}
