Queries with value and dimension subsetting conditions are commonly used by scientists to find useful information from big array data, and data storage and indexing methods play an important role in supporting queries on multidimensional array data efficiently. In this paper, we propose SwiftArray, a new storage layout with indexing techniques to accelerate queries with value and dimension subsetting conditions. In SwiftArray, the multidimensional array is divided into blocks and each block stores sorted values. Blocks are placed in the order of a Hilbert space-filling curve to improve data locality for dimension subsetting queries. We propose a 2-D-Bin method to build an index for the blocks' value ranges, which is an efficient way to avoid accessing unnecessary blocks for value subsetting queries. Our evaluations show that SwiftArray surpasses the NetCDF-4 format and FastBit indexing technique for queries on multidimensional arrays.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "521", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "530", "date_publication": "Oct. 2014", "inspec": "15571464", "date": "Oct. 2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 13 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "5", "pages": "521 - 530", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Yifeng Geng", "Xiaomeng Huang", "Guangwen Yang"], "keywords": ["Big Data", "Hilbert spaces", "curve fitting", "indexing", "query processing", "2-D-Bin method", "FastBit indexing technique", "Hilbert space-filling curve", "NetCDF-4 format", "SwiftArray", "big array data", "block value ranges", "data locality", "data storage", "dimension subsetting conditions", "indexing methods", "multidimensional array data", "query acceleration", "scientific instruments", "simulation programs", "value subsetting queries", "Arrays", "Complexity theory", "Indexing", "Layout", "Memory", "Query processing", "indexing", "multidimensional array", "space-filling curve", ""], "arnumber": "6919829"}
