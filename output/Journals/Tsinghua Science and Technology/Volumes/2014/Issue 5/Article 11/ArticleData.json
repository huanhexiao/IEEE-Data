In this paper, we propose a two-class prioritybased polling system that uses gated and exhaustive services to achieve the priority-based scheme. This model is set up according to the method of the imbedded Markov chain theory and the generation function and explicitly analyzes key system performance characteristics including mean queue length, cyclic time, and throughput. Theoretical and simulation results are identical and demonstrate the efficiency of the model.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "516", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "520", "date_publication": "Oct. 2014", "inspec": "15583015", "date": "Oct. 2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 13 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "5", "pages": "516 - 520", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Zhijun Yang", "Hongwei Ding"], "keywords": ["Markov processes", "queueing theory", "computer network", "generation function", "imbedded Markov chain theory", "industrial control", "mean queue length", "time-sharing computer system", "two-class polling system model", "Analytical models", "Computational modeling", "Computer networks", "Educational institutions", "Logic gates", "Queueing analysis", "Throughput", "exhaustive service", "gated service", "polling system", "priority-based scheme", ""], "arnumber": "6919828"}
