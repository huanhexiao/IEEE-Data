A new targeted fully homomorphic encryption scheme based on the discrete logarithm problem is presented. Public-key encryption cryptosystems are classified to examine homomorphic encryption. Without employing techniques proposed by Gentry such as somewhat homomorphic and bootstrapping techniques, or relinearization technique proposed by Brakerski et al., a new method called \u201dDouble Decryption Algorithm\u201d is employed in our cryptography to satisfy a fully or targeted fully homomorphic property. Inspired by ElGamal and BGN cryptography, we obtain the desired fully homomorphic property by selecting a new group and adding an extra component to the ciphertext. Proof of semantic security is also demonstrated.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "478", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "485", "date_publication": "Oct. 2014", "inspec": "15583011", "date": "Oct. 2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 13 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "5", "pages": "478 - 485", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Yatao Yang", "Shuang Zhang", "Junming Yang", "Jia Li", "Zichen Li"], "keywords": ["polynomials", "public key cryptography", "statistical analysis", "BGN cryptography", "ElGamal cryptography", "bootstrapping technique", "ciphertext data processing", "discrete logarithm problem", "double decryption algorithm", "polynomials", "public-key encryption cryptosystem", "public-key encryption scheme", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Elliptic curve cryptography", "Encryption", "Polynomials", "discrete logarithm problem", "exponential function method", "power function method", "targeted fully homomorphic encryption", ""], "arnumber": "6919824"}
