However, traditional methods of malicious code detection, such as signature detection, behavior detection, virtual machine detection, and heuristic detection, have various weaknesses which make them unreliable. This paper presents the existing technologies of malicious code detection and a malicious code detection model is proposed based on behavior association. The behavior points of malicious code are first extracted through API monitoring technology and integrated into the behavior; then a relation between behaviors is established according to data dependence. Next, a behavior association model is built up and a discrimination method is put forth using pushdown automation. Finally, the exact malicious code is taken as a sample to carry out an experiment on the behavior's capture, association, and discrimination, thus proving that the theoretical model is viable.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "508", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "515", "date_publication": "Oct. 2014", "inspec": "15583014", "date": "Oct. 2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 13 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "5", "pages": "508 - 515", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Lansheng Han", "Mengxiao Qian", "Xingbo Xu", "Cai Fu", "Hamza Kwisaba"], "keywords": ["behavioural sciences computing", "security of data", "API monitoring technology", "behavior association model", "financial reward", "government intellectual property", "malicious code detection model", "pushdown automation", "remote control", "Automation", "Computers", "Grammar", "Monitoring", "Trojan horses", "Virtual machining", "behavior association", "behavior monitor", "malicious code", "pushdown automation", ""], "arnumber": "6919827"}
