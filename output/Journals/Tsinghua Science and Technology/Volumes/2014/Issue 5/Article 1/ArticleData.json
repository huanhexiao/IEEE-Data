An improvement based on attack analysis is proposed in this paper. The improved method takes full advantage of the data transmitted at various stages of the protocol. By guaranteeing the freshness of authentication messages, the authenticity of the generator of authentication messages, and the completeness of the authenticator, the improved protocol can resist various passive and active attacks. The forward secrecy of the improved protocol is proved under a Katz-Yung (KY) model. Compared with existing methods, the improved protocol is more effective and applicable.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "421", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "428", "date_publication": "Oct. 2014", "inspec": "15571458", "date": "Oct. 2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 13 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "5", "pages": "421 - 428", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Kangwen Hu", "Jingfeng Xue", "Changzhen Hu", "Rui Ma", "Zhiqiang Li"], "keywords": ["cryptographic protocols", "Katz-Yung model", "active attacks", "attack analysis", "authentication messages", "group key agreement protocol", "improved ID", "message authentication", "passive attacks", "Authentication", "Equations", "Generators", "Protocols", "Resists", "Silicon", "ID", "forward secrecy", "group key agreement protocol", "nonsuper-singular elliptic curve", ""], "arnumber": "6919818"}
