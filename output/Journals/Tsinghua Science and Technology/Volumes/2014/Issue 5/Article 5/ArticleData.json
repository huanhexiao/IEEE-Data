Therefore, it was suitable for the shallow circuits whose depth is bounded. For decreasing the key size of previous scheme, combining the techniques of Two-to-One Recoding (TOR), and sampling on lattices, we propose a new Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (KP-ABE) scheme for circuits of any arbitrary polynomial on lattices, and prove that the scheme is secure against chosen plaintext attack in the selective model under the Learning With Errors (LWE) assumptions. In our scheme, the key size is proportional to the number of gates or wires in the circuits.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "463", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "469", "date_publication": "Oct. 2014", "inspec": "15571462", "date": "Oct. 2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 13 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "5", "pages": "463 - 469", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Jian Zhao", "Haiying Gao", "Junqi Zhang"], "keywords": ["cryptography", "logic gates", "AND gates", "KP-ABE scheme", "LWE", "key-policy attribute-based encryption scheme", "learning with errors", "plaintext attack", "two-to-one recoding", "Encryption", "Lattices", "Logic gates", "Polynomials", "Vectors", "Wires", "Zinc", "Learning With Errors (LWE)", "attribute-based encryption", "circuits", "lattice", ""], "arnumber": "6919822"}
