The existing CCA-secure public key cryptosystems on the standard model are expensive in terms of efficiency and practicality. In this paper, an efficient and practical public key cryptosystem is presented over the group of signed quadratic residues. It is provably secure against CCA on the standard model. Furthermore, public verifiability for this scheme is also realized in the way that projects the verification privacy key into public key on trapdoor pretending. It will be useful to devise efficient CCA-secure threshold and proxy re-encryption schemes on the standard model.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "486", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "495", "date_publication": "Oct. 2014", "inspec": "15583012", "date": "Oct. 2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 13 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "5", "pages": "486 - 495", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Zhen Liu", "Xiaoyuan Yang", "Weidong Zhong", "Yiliang Han"], "keywords": ["formal verification", "public key cryptography", "CCA-secure public cryptosystem", "CCA-secure threshold", "chosen ciphertext attack security", "proxy re-encryption scheme", "public verifiability", "standard model", "verification privacy key", "Encryption", "Logic gates", "Public key cryptography", "Standards", "Chosen Ciphertext Attack (CCA)-security", "public key cryptosystem", "public verifiability", "standard model", ""], "arnumber": "6919825"}
