Subjective and objective data were collected from 216 respondents in a field experiment. The results indicate that information quality and source credibility of microblogging messages affect users' reposting intention by affecting their perceptions of the usefulness and enjoyment of the information. Perceived enjoyment has a greater impact on reposting intention than perceived usefulness. Furthermore, users are able to perceive social presence when interacting with microblogging messages. Social presence plays a full mediating role between information quality and perceived enjoyment, and a partial mediating role between information quality and perceived usefulness.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "531", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "542", "date_publication": "Oct. 2014", "inspec": "15571465", "date": "Oct. 2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 13 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "5", "pages": "531 - 542", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Wei Yan", "Jinghua Huang"], "keywords": ["Web sites", "ELM", "elaboration likelihood model", "information adoption perspective", "microblogging message information quality", "microblogging message source credibility", "microblogging reposting mechanism", "perceived enjoyment", "perceived usefulness", "social presence theory", "user reposting intention", "Fans", "Information management", "Information processing", "Instruments", "Media", "Sensitivity", "elaboration likelihood model", "field experiment", "information adoption", "microblogging", "reposting", "social presence", ""], "arnumber": "6919830"}
