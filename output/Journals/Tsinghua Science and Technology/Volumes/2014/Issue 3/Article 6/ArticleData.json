To rationally design multi-target drugs, it is fundamental to understand protein-ligand interactions on a proteome scale. We have developed a Proteome-wide Off-target Pipeline (POP) that integrates ligand binding site analysis, protein-ligand docking, the statistical analysis of docking scores, and electrostatic potential calculations. The utility of POP is demonstrated by a case study, in which the molecular mechanism of anti-cancer effect of Nelfinavir is hypothesized. By combining structural proteome-wide off-target identification and systems biology, it is possible for us to correlate drug perturbations with clinical outcomes.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "275", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "284", "date_publication": "June 2014", "inspec": "15568252", "date": "June 2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Jun 18 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "3", "pages": "275 - 284", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Thomas Evangelidis", "Lei Xie"], "keywords": ["biology computing", "cancer", "drugs", "proteins", "proteomics", "statistical analysis", "Nelfinavir", "POP", "anti-cancer effect", "docking score", "drug discovery process", "drug perturbation", "electrostatic potential calculation", "integrated workflow", "ligand binding site analysis", "molecular mechanism", "polypharmacology drug design", "protein-ligand docking", "protein-ligand interaction", "proteome scale", "statistical analysis", "structural proteome-wide off-target identification", "system biology", "Carbon", "Diseases", "Drugs", "Electric potential", "Electrostatics", "Inhibitors", "Proteins", "drug discovery", "off-target", "polypharmacology", "structural proteomics", "systems biology", ""], "arnumber": "6838198"}
