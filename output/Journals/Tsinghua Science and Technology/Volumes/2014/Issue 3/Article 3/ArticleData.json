Extensive research efforts have been dedicated to this task, while it is still difficult to measure the relevance between two objects with multiple views. In recent years, learning-based methods have been investigated in view-based 3-D object retrieval, such as graph-based learning. It is noted that the graph-based methods suffer from the high computational cost from the graph construction and the corresponding learning process. In this paper, we introduce a general framework to accelerate the learning-based view-based 3-D object matching in large scale data. Given a query object Q and one object O from a 3-D dataset D, the first step is to extract a small set of candidate relevant 3-D objects for object O. Then multiple hypergraphs can be constructed based on this small set of 3-D objects and the learning on the fused hypergraph is conducted to generate the relevance between Q and O, which can be further used in the retrieval procedure. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "250", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "256", "date_publication": "June 2014", "inspec": "15568249", "date": "June 2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Jun 18 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "3", "pages": "250 - 256", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Yue Gao", "Qionghai Dai"], "keywords": ["graph theory", "image matching", "image retrieval", "learning (artificial intelligence)", "solid modelling", "cameras", "fused hypergraph", "graph construction", "graph-based methods", "hypergraph learning", "learning process", "learning-based methods", "learning-based view-based 3-D object matching", "mobile phones", "multiple views", "query object", "view-based 3-D object retrieval", "visual content acquisition devices", "Cameras", "Computational efficiency", "Feature extraction", "Learning systems", "Measurement", "Solid modeling", "Visualization", "3-D object retrieval", "hypergraph learning", "view-based", ""], "arnumber": "6838195"}
