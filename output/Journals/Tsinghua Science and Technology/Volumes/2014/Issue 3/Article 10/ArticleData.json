Memristor exhibits great potential for numerous applications, such as emulating synapse, while the mathematical model of the memristor is still an open subject. In the linear-drift model, the boundary condition of the device is not considered. This paper proposes an extended linear-drift model of the memristor. The extended linear-drift model keeps the linear characteristic and simplicity of the linear-drift model and considers the boundary condition of the device. A piecewise linear approximation model of the extended linear-drift model is given. Both models are suitable for describing the memristor.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "307", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "313", "date_publication": "June 2014", "inspec": "15568255", "date": "June 2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Jun 18 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "3", "pages": "307 - 313", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Xiaomu Mu", "Juntang Yu", "Shuning Wang"], "keywords": ["approximation theory", "memristors", "piecewise linear techniques", "boundary condition", "extended linear-drift model", "mathematical model", "memristor", "piecewise linear approximation model", "Analytical models", "Integrated circuit modeling", "Linear approximation", "Mathematical model", "Memristors", "Piecewise linear approximation", "Resistance", "hysteresis", "mathematical model", "memristor", "piecewise linear", ""], "arnumber": "6838202"}
