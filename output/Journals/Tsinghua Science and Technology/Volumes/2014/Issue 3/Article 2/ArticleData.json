Among others, activity recognition, which takes the raw sensor reading as inputs and predicts a user's motion activity, has become an active research area in recent years. It is the core building block in many high-impact applications, ranging from health and fitness monitoring, personal biometric signature, urban computing, assistive technology, and elder-care, to indoor localization and navigation, etc. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the recent advances in activity recognition with smartphones' sensors. We start with the basic concepts such as sensors, activity types, etc. We review the core data mining techniques behind the main stream activity recognition algorithms, analyze their major challenges, and introduce a variety of real applications enabled by activity recognition.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "235", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "249", "date_publication": "June 2014", "inspec": "15568248", "date": "June 2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Jun 18 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "3", "pages": "235 - 249", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Xing Su", "Hanghang Tong", "Ping Ji"], "keywords": ["smart phones", "ubiquitous computing", "activity recognition", "assistive technology", "elder-care", "fitness monitoring", "health monitoring", "high-impact applications", "personal biometric signature", "smartphone sensors", "ubiquitous computing", "urban computing", "activity recognition", "data mining", "machine learning", "mobile sensors", "pattern recognition", ""], "arnumber": "6838194"}
