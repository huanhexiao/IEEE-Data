Such a system has wide applications in the scenarios of traffic control, battlefield surveillance, environmental monitoring, and so on. A core element of CPS is the collection and assessment of information from noisy, dynamic, and uncertain physical environments integrated with many types of cyber-space resources. The potential of this integration is unbounded. To achieve this potential the raw data acquired from the physical world must be transformed into useable knowledge in real-time. Therefore, CPS brings a new dimension to knowledge discovery because of the emerging synergism of the physical and the cyber. The various properties of the physical world must be addressed in information management and knowledge discovery. This paper discusses the problems of mining sensor data in CPS: With a large number of wireless sensors deployed in a designated area, the task is real time detection of intruders that enter the area based on noisy sensor data. The framework of IntruMine is introduced to discover intruders from untrustworthy sensor data. IntruMine first analyzes the trustworthiness of sensor data, then detects the intruders' locations, and verifies the detections based on a graph model of the relationships between sensors and intruders.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "225", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "234", "date_publication": "June 2014", "inspec": "15568247", "date": "June 2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Jun 18 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "3", "pages": "225 - 234", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Lu-An Tang", "Jiawei Han", "Guofei Jiang"], "keywords": ["data mining", "information management", "wireless sensor networks", "context sensitive system", "cyber components", "cyber-physical systems", "graph model", "information assessment", "information collection", "information management", "knowledge discovery", "noisy sensor data", "physical devices", "sensor data mining", "untrustworthy sensor data", "wireless sensors", "Coherence", "Data mining", "Data models", "Feature extraction", "Monitoring", "Real-time systems", "Training", "cyber-physical system", "data trustworthiness", "sensor network", ""], "arnumber": "6838193"}
