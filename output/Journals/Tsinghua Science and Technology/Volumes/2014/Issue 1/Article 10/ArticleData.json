According to the internal statistics of China Unicom, mobile user traffic has increased rapidly with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 135%. Currently China Unicom monthly stores more than 2 trillion records, data volume is over 525 TB, and the highest data volume has reached a peak of 5 PB. Since October 2009, China Unicom has been developing a home-brewed big data storage and analysis platform based on the open source Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) as it has a long-term strategy to make full use of this Big Data. All Mobile Internet Traffic is well served using this big data platform. Currently, the writing speed has reached 1 390 000 records per second, and the record retrieval time in the table that contains trillions of records is less than 100 ms. To take advantage of this opportunity to be a Big Data Operator, China Unicom has developed new functions and has multiple innovations to solve space and time constraint challenges presented in data processing. In this paper, we will introduce our big data platform in detail. Based on this big data platform, China Unicom is building an industry ecosystem based on Mobile Internet Big Data, and considers that a telecom operator centric ecosystem can be formed that is critical to reach prosperity in the modern communications business.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "95", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "101", "date_publication": "Feb. 2014", "inspec": "15582858", "date": "Feb. 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 07 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "1", "pages": "95 - 101", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Wenliang Huang", "Zhen Chen", "Wenyu Dong", "Hang Li", "Bin Cao", "Junwei Cao"], "keywords": ["Big Data", "Internet", "mobile computing", "parallel processing", "public domain software", "storage allocation", "telecommunication traffic", "Big Data operator", "Big data analysis platform", "Big data storage platform", "CAGR", "China Unicom", "WCDMA 3G operator", "compound annual growth rate", "mobile Internet Big data platform", "mobile Internet explosion", "mobile Internet traffic", "mobile terminal", "mobile user traffic", "open source HDFS", "open source Hadoop distributed file system", "telecom operator centric ecosystem", "Data handling", "Data storage systems", "IP networks", "Information management", "Internet", "Mobile communication", "Mobile computing", "3G wireless network", "China Unicom", "HBase", "Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)", "big data platform", "data warehouse", "mobile Internet", "network forensic", ""], "arnumber": "6733212"}
