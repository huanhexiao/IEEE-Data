In this study, we propose a parallel data mining system for analyzing big graph data generated on a Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) computing model named BSP-based Parallel Graph Mining (BPGM). This system has four sets of parallel graph mining algorithms programmed in the BSP parallel model and a well-designed workflow engine optimized for cloud computing to invoke these algorithms. Experimental results show that the graph mining algorithm components in BPGM are efficient and have better performance than big cloud-based parallel data miner and BC-BSP.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "33", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "38", "date_publication": "Feb. 2014", "inspec": "15568229", "date": "Feb. 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 07 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "1", "pages": "33 - 38", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Yang Liu", "Bin Wu", "Hongxu Wang", "Pengjiang Ma"], "keywords": ["data mining", "graph theory", "parallel processing", "BPGM", "BSP computing", "big graph analysis", "big graph mining tool", "bulk synchronous parallel computing", "parallel data mining system", "scalable parallel mining system", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Clustering algorithms", "Computational modeling", "Data mining", "Engines", "Parallel processing", "Partitioning algorithms", "cloud computing", "data mining", "graph data analysis", "parallel algorithms", "social network analysis", ""], "arnumber": "6733206"}
