In this study, we propose a new Hierarchical Covering Algorithm (HCA) method to determine the levels of a hierarchical structure based on the Covering Algorithm (CA). The CA constructs neural networks based on samples' own characteristics, and can effectively handle multi-category classification and large-scale data. Further, we abstract characters based on the CA to automatically embody the feature of a deep structure. We apply CA to construct hidden nodes at the lower level, and define a fuzzy equivalence relation R on upper spaces to form a hierarchical architecture based on fuzzy quotient space theory. The covering tree naturally becomes from R. HCA experiments performed on MNIST dataset show that the covering tree embodies the deep architecture of the problem, and the effects of a deep structure are shown to be better than having a single level.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "76", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "81", "date_publication": "Feb. 2014", "inspec": "15568233", "date": "Feb. 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 07 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "1", "pages": "76 - 81", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Jie Chen", "Shu Zhao", "Yanping Zhang"], "keywords": ["learning (artificial intelligence)", "neural nets", "HCA", "MNIST dataset", "abstract characters", "deep learning concept", "fuzzy equivalence relation", "fuzzy quotient space theory", "hierarchical architecture", "hierarchical covering algorithm", "hierarchical structure", "neural networks", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Artificial intelligence", "Artificial neural networks", "Computer architecture", "Signal processing algorithms", "Speech recognition", "Training", "MNIST dataset", "covering tree", "deep architecture", "fuzzy equivalence relation", "hierarchy", ""], "arnumber": "6733210"}
