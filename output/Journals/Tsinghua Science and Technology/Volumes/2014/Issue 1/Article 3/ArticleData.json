Deploying and operating such systems require large amount of costs, including hardware costs to build clusters and energy costs to run clusters. To make these systems sustainable and scalable, power management has been an important research problem. In this paper, we take Hadoop as an example to illustrate the power peak problem which causes power inefficiency and provides in-depth analysis to explain issues with existing system designs. We propose a novel power capping module in the Hadoop scheduler to mitigate power peaks. Extensive simulation studies show that our proposed solution can effectively smooth the power consumption curve and mitigate temporary power peaks for Hadoop clusters.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "24", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "32", "date_publication": "Feb. 2014", "inspec": "15568228", "date": "Feb. 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 07 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "1", "pages": "24 - 32", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Nan Zhu", "Xue Liu", "Jie Liu", "Yu Hua"], "keywords": ["data handling", "parallel processing", "power aware computing", "Hadoop clusters", "Hadoop scheduler", "cost-efficient MapReduce", "power consumption curve", "power peaks mitigation", "Adaptation models", "Power demand", "Processor scheduling", "Scalability", "Schedules", "Servers", "System performance", "MapReduce", "power management", "power peaks", ""], "arnumber": "6733205"}
