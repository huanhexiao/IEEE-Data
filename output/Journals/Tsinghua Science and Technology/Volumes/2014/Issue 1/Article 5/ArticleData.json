Google's MapReduce and Apache's Hadoop, its open-source implementation, are the defacto software systems for big-data applications. An observation of the MapReduce framework is that the framework generates a large amount of intermediate data. Such abundant information is thrown away after the tasks finish, because MapReduce is unable to utilize them. In this paper, we propose Dache, a data-aware cache framework for big-data applications. In Dache, tasks submit their intermediate results to the cache manager. A task queries the cache manager before executing the actual computing work. A novel cache description scheme and a cache request and reply protocol are designed. We implement Dache by extending Hadoop. Testbed experiment results demonstrate that Dache significantly improves the completion time of MapReduce jobs.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "39", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "50", "date_publication": "Feb. 2014", "inspec": "15568230", "date": "Feb. 2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 07 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "1", "pages": "39 - 50", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Yaxiong Zhao", "Jie Wu", "Cong Liu"], "keywords": ["Big Data", "cache storage", "parallel processing", "public domain software", "Apache Hadoop", "Big-Data applications", "Dache", "Google", "MapReduce framework", "buzz-word big-data", "cache description scheme", "cache request", "data aware caching", "distributed data processing applications", "open-source implementation", "reply protocol", "Context", "Distributed databases", "Google", "Java", "Open source software", "Programming", "Protocols", "Hadoop", "MapReduce", "big-data", "caching", ""], "arnumber": "6733207"}
