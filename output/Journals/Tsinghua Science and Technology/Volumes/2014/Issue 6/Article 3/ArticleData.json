They are considered as one of the prime drug targets since mutations and aberrant TF-DNA interactions are implicated in many diseases. Identification of TF-binding sites on a genomic scale represents a critical step in delineating transcription regulatory networks and remains a major goal in genomic annotations. Recent development of experimental high-throughput technologies has provided valuable information about TF-binding sites at genome scale under various physiological and developmental conditions. Computational approaches can provide a cost-effective alternative and complement the experimental methods by using the vast quantities of available sequence or structural information. In this review we focus on structure-based prediction of transcription factor binding sites. In addition to its potential in genomescale predictions, structure-based approaches can help us better understand the TF-DNA interaction mechanisms and the evolution of transcription factors and their target binding sites. The success of structure-based methods also bears a translational impact on targeted drug design in medicine and biotechnology.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "568", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "577", "date_publication": "Dec. 2014", "inspec": "15571466", "date": "Dec. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 20 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "6", "pages": "568 - 577", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Jun-tao Guo", "Shane Lofgren", "Alvin Farrel"], "keywords": ["DNA", "biology computing", "diseases", "drugs", "genetics", "genomics", "physiology", "proteins", "DNA sequences", "DNA-binding proteins", "TF-DNA interactions", "TF-binding site identification", "diseases", "drug", "experimental high-throughput technologies", "gene expression regulation", "genome-scale prediction", "genomic annotations", "genomic scale", "mutations", "structural information", "structure-based approach", "structure-based prediction", "transcription factor binding sites", "transcription regulatory networks", "Bioinformatics", "DNA", "Electrostatics", "Genomics", "Geometry", "In vivo", "Proteins", "knowledge-based potential", "physics-based potential", "structure-based predictions", "transcription factor binding site", ""], "arnumber": "6961027"}
