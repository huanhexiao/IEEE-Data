The challenge of mono-isotope pattern recognition from large scale protein mass spectral data needs computational algorithms and tools to speed up the analysis and improve the analytic results. We utilized naive Bayes network as the classifier with the assumption that the selected features are independent to predict mono-isotope pattern from mass spectrometry. Mono-isotopes detected from validated theoretical spectra were used as prior information in the Bayes method. Three main features extracted from the dataset were employed as independent variables in our model. The application of the proposed algorithm to publicMo dataset demonstrates that our naive Bayes classifier is advantageous over existing methods in both accuracy and sensitivity.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "617", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "623", "date_publication": "Dec. 2014", "inspec": "15571469", "date": "Dec. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 20 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "6", "pages": "617 - 623", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Hui Li", "Chunmei Liu", "Mugizi Robert Rwebangira", "Legand Burge"], "keywords": ["Bayes methods", "biological techniques", "mass spectroscopy", "proteins", "Bayes classifier", "Bayes network", "feature extraction", "mass spectrometry", "monoisotope pattern recognition", "monoisotope prediction", "protein component", "protein function", "protein mass spectral data", "publicMo dataset", "Data mining", "Feature extraction", "Isotopes", "Noise", "Peptides", "Prediction algorithms", "Proteins", "Bayes network", "mono-isotope prediction", "tandem mass spectrum", ""], "arnumber": "6961030"}
