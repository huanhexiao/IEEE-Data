Although traditional single-locus statistical approaches have been standardized and led to many interesting findings, a substantial number of recent GWASs indicate that for most disorders, the individual SNPs explain only a small fraction of the genetic causes. Consequently, exploring multi-SNPs interactions in the hope of discovering more significant associations has attracted more attentions. Due to the huge search space for complicated multilocus interactions, many fast and effective methods have recently been proposed for detecting disease-associated epistatic interactions using GWAS data. In this paper, we provide a critical review and comparison of eight popular methods, i.e., BOOST, TEAM, epiForest, EDCF, SNPHarvester, epiMODE, MECPM, and MIC, which are used for detecting gene-gene interactions among genetic loci. In views of the assumption model on the data and searching strategies, we divide the methods into seven categories. Moreover, the evaluation methodologies, including detecting powers, disease models for simulation, resources of real GWAS data, and the control of false discover rate, are elaborated as references for new approach developers. At the end of the paper, we summarize the methods and discuss the future directions in genome-wide association studies for detecting epistatic interactions.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "596", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "616", "date_publication": "Dec. 2014", "inspec": "15571468", "date": "Dec. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 20 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "6", "pages": "596 - 616", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Xuan Guo", "Ning Yu", "Feng Gu", "Xiaojun Ding", "Jianxin Wang", "Yi Pan"], "keywords": ["diseases", "genetics", "genomics", "macromolecules", "medical disorders", "molecular biophysics", "polymorphism", "statistical analysis", "BOOST", "EDCF", "GWAS data", "MECPM", "MIC", "SNPHarvester", "TEAM", "disease models", "disease-associated epistatic interactions", "epiForest", "epiMODE", "false discover rate", "gene-gene interactions", "genetic loci", "genetic variants", "genome-wide interaction-based association", "human diseases", "medical disorders", "multiSNPs interactions", "multilocus interactions", "single nucleotide polymorphisms", "substantial number", "traditional single-locus statistical approaches", "Bioinformatics", "DNA", "Data models", "Diseases", "Genomics", "Search problems", "Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)", "complex disease", "epistasis", "epistatic interaction", "genome-wide association", ""], "arnumber": "6961029"}
