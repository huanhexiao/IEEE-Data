The relationship between protein sequence and structure often serves as a basis for protein structure QA. In this work, we developed a new Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to assess the compatibility of protein sequence and structure for capturing their complex relationship. More specifically, the emission of the HMM consists of protein local structures in angular space, secondary structures, and sequence profiles. This model has two capabilities: (1) encoding local structure of each position by jointly considering sequence and structure information, and (2) assigning a global score to estimate the overall quality of a predicted structure, as well as local scores to assess the quality of specific regions of a structure, which provides useful guidance for targeted structure refinement. We compared the HMM model to state-of-art single structure quality assessment methods OPUSCA, DFIRE, GOAP, and RW in protein structure selection. Computational results showed our new score HMM.Z can achieve better overall selection performance on the benchmark datasets.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "559", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "567", "date_publication": "Dec. 2014", "inspec": "15583017", "date": "Dec. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 20 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "6", "pages": "559 - 567", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Zhiquan He", "Wenji Ma", "Jingfen Zhang", "Dong Xu"], "keywords": ["hidden Markov models", "molecular biophysics", "proteins", "DFIRE", "GOAP", "HMM model", "OPUSCA", "hidden Markov Model", "protein local structure", "protein sequence", "protein structure QA", "protein structure prediction", "protein structure quality assessment", "protein structure selection", "Amino acids", "Correlation", "Databases", "Hidden Markov models", "Protein sequence", "Quality assessment", "Hidden Markov Model (HMM)", "protein structure prediction", "structure quality assessment", ""], "arnumber": "6961026"}
