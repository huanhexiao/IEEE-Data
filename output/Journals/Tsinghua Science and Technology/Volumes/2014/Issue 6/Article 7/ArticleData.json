Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) analysis provides a powerful way to understand how genetic variants affect gene expression. For genome wide eQTL analysis, the number of genetic variants and that of genes are large and thus the search space is tremendous. Therefore, eQTL analysis brings about computational and statistical challenges. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advances in methods for eQTL analysis in population-based studies. We first present traditional pairwise association methods, which are widely used in human genetics. To account for expression heterogeneity, we investigate the methods for correcting confounding factors. Next, we discuss newly developed statistical learning methods including Lasso-based models. In the conclusion, we provide an overview of future method development in analyzing eQTL associations. Although we focus on human genetics in this review, the methods are applicable to many other organisms.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "624", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "634", "date_publication": "Dec. 2014", "inspec": "15571470", "date": "Dec. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 20 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "6", "pages": "624 - 634", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Lu Tian", "Andrew Quitadamo", "Frederick Lin", "Xinghua Shi"], "keywords": ["genetics", "statistical analysis", "Expression Quantitative Trait Loci", "Lasso-based model", "biological system", "confounding factors", "gene expression heterogeneity", "genetic variation", "human genetics", "population-based eQTL analysis", "population-based study", "statistical learning method", "Bioinformatics", "Correlation", "Gene expression", "Genomics", "Sociology", "Lasso", "confounding factors", "expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) analysis", "sparse learning models", ""], "arnumber": "6961031"}
