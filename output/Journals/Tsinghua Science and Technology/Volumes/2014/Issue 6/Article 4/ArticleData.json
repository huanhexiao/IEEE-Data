MRI-based brain tumor segmentation studies are attracting more and more attention in recent years due to non-invasive imaging and good soft tissue contrast of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images. With the development of almost two decades, the innovative approaches applying computer-aided techniques for segmenting brain tumor are becoming more and more mature and coming closer to routine clinical applications. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview for MRI-based brain tumor segmentation methods. Firstly, a brief introduction to brain tumors and imaging modalities of brain tumors is given. Then, the preprocessing operations and the state of the art methods of MRI-based brain tumor segmentation are introduced. Moreover, the evaluation and validation of the results of MRI-based brain tumor segmentation are discussed. Finally, an objective assessment is presented and future developments and trends are addressed for MRI-based brain tumor segmentation methods.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "578", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "595", "date_publication": "Dec. 2014", "inspec": "15571467", "date": "Dec. 2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 20 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issue": "6", "pages": "578 - 595", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Jin Liu", "Min Li", "Jianxin Wang", "Fangxiang Wu", "Tianming Liu", "Yi Pan"], "keywords": ["biomedical MRI", "brain", "cancer", "cellular biophysics", "image segmentation", "medical image processing", "tumours", "MRI-based brain tumor segmentation methods", "active cells", "cerebrospinal fluid", "computer-aided techniques", "edema", "gray matter", "magnetic resonance imaging", "necrotic core", "noninvasive imaging", "normal brain tissues", "objective assessment", "routine clinical applications", "soft tissue contrast", "tumor tissues", "white matter", "Cancer", "Educational institutions", "Image segmentation", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Manuals", "Tumors", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)", "brain tumor", "segmentation", ""], "arnumber": "6961028"}
