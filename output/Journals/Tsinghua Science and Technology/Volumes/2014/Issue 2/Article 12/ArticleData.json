In this paper, to lay a solid foundation for future research into the safety verification of semialgebraic dynamical systems, we first establish a formal framework for evaluating the quality of continuous inductive conditions. In addition, we propose a new complete and computable inductive condition for verifying the safety of semi-algebraic dynamical systems. Compared with the existing complete and computable inductive condition, this new inductive condition can be easily adapted to achieve a set of sufficient inductive conditions with different level of conservativeness and computational complexity, which provides us with a means to trade off between the verification power and complexity. These inductive conditions can be solved by quantifier elimination and SMT solvers.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "211", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "222", "date_publication": "April 2014", "inspec": "15568246", "date": "April 2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 15 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "2", "pages": "211 - 222", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Hui Kong", "Fei He", "Xiaoyu Song", "Ming Gu", "Hongyan Tan", "Jiaguang Sun"], "keywords": ["algebra", "nonlinear dynamical systems", "SMT solvers", "continuous inductive conditions", "inductive invariant", "nonlinear dynamical systems", "safety verification", "semialgebraic dynamical systems", "sufficient inductive conditions", "Computational complexity", "Polynomials", "Safety", "Sun", "Trajectory", "Vectors", "hybrid system", "inductive invariant", "nonlinear system", "safety verification", "semi-algebraic dynamical system", ""], "arnumber": "6787375"}
