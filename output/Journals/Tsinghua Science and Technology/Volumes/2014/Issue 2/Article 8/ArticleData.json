Service quality and productivity are two critical indicators to evaluate the competitiveness of e-commerce companies. Deciding which provision mode of e-commerce services (buy, sell, or self-provide) to adopt is a key operational strategy issue. This paper investigates the conditions and limitations of e-commerce services' optimal supply modes, and proposes a cost oriented infra-marginal model where service demand is considered an exogenous variable due to its non-elastic and unprofitable characteristics. By analyzing the main impact factors of this model, this paper infers provision mode selection strategies, which are determined by four factors: transaction cost, service price, service demand, and competitive advantages. Decision trees are derived from these strategies to help e-commerce companies make appropriate decisions. Finally, the proposed model's feasibility is verified by two case studies.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "174", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "183", "date_publication": "April 2014", "inspec": "15568242", "date": "April 2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 15 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "2", "pages": "174 - 183", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Xiao Yu", "Yueting Chai", "Yi Liu", "Hongbo Sun"], "keywords": ["competitive intelligence", "customer services", "decision trees", "electronic commerce", "pricing", "productivity", "profitability", "Internet", "competitive advantages", "cost oriented inframarginal model", "decision trees", "e-commerce companies", "e-commerce services", "inframarginal analysis model", "operational strategy issue", "productivity", "provision mode selection", "provision mode selection strategies", "service demand", "service price", "service quality", "transaction cost", "unprofitable characteristics", "Analytical models", "Companies", "Cost function", "Electronic commerce", "Investment", "Mathematical model", "Productivity", "cost minimizing", "e-commerce", "e-commerce services", "infra-marginal analysis", "provision mode selection", ""], "arnumber": "6787371"}
