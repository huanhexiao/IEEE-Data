However, the existing schemes for evaluating the Gaussian Copula PDF are all computationally-demanding and generally the most time-consuming part in the corresponding applications. In this paper, we propose an FPGA-based design to accelerate the computation of the Gaussian Copula PDF. Specifically, the evaluation of the Gaussian Copula PDF is mapped into a fully-pipelined FPGA dataflow engine by using three optimization steps: transforming the calculation pattern, eliminating constant computations from hardware logic, and extending calculations to multiple pipelines. In the experiments on 10 typical large-scale data sets, our FPGA-based solution shows a maximum of 1870 times speedup over a well-tuned single-core CPU-based solution, and 610 times speedup over a well-optimized parallel quad-core CPU-based solution when processing two-dimensional data.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "194", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "202", "date_publication": "April 2014", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 15 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "2", "pages": "194 - 202"}, "authors": ["Huabin Ruan", "Xiaomeng Huang", "Haohuan Fu", "Guangwen Yang"], "keywords": ["Acceleration", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Computational modeling", "Field programmable gate arrays", "Hardware", "Matrix decomposition", "Probability density function", "FPGA", "Gaussian Copula probability density function", "optimization", "pipeline", ""], "arnumber": "6787373"}
