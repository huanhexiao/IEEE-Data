This study presents an integrated simulation environment to provide a unified platform for the investigation of smart grid applications involving power grid monitoring, communication, and control. In contrast to the existing approaches, this environment allows the network simulator to operate independently, importing its results to the power system simulation. This resolves conflicts between discrete event simulation and continuous simulation. In addition, several data compensation methods are proposed and investigated under different network delay conditions. A case study of wide-area monitoring and control is provided, and the efficiency of the proposed simulation framework has been evaluated based on the experimental results.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "133", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "143", "date_publication": "April 2014", "inspec": "15568237", "date": "April 2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 15 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "2", "pages": "133 - 143", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Yuxin Wan", "Junwei Cao", "Shuqing Zhang", "Guoyu Tu", "Chao Lu", "Xingtao Xu", "Keqin Li"], "keywords": ["power system control", "power system measurement", "power system simulation", "smart power grids", "data compensation method", "integrated cyber-physical simulation", "power grid monitoring", "power system simulation", "smart grid applications", "Communication networks", "Computational modeling", "Data models", "Delays", "Smart grids", "control", "cyber-physical system", "simulation", "smart grid", "wide-area monitoring", ""], "arnumber": "6787366"}
