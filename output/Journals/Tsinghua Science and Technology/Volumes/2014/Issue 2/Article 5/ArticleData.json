Sputtering is an important deposition method for via metallization in semiconductor process. However, due to the limitation of sputtering and a \u201cscallop\u201d profile inside vias, poor step coverage of the barrier/seed layer always occurs in the via metallization process. In this paper, the effects of several sputter parameters (DC power, Ar pressure, deposition time, and substrate temperature) on thin film coverage for TSV applications are investigated. Robust TSVs with aspect ratio 5 : 1 were obtained with optimized magnetron sputter parameters. In addition, the influences of different sputter parameters are compared and the conclusion could be used as a guideline to select appropriate parameter sets.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "150", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "160", "date_publication": "April 2014", "inspec": "15568239", "date": "April 2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 15 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "2", "pages": "150 - 160", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Tiwei Wei", "Jian Cai", "Qian Wang", "Yang Hu", "Lu Wang", "Ziyu Liu", "Zijian Wu"], "keywords": ["circuit optimisation", "metallisation", "sputter deposition", "thin films", "three-dimensional integrated circuits", "3D integration", "TSV technology", "deposition method", "magnetron sputter parameters", "semiconductor process", "sputtering barrier-seed layer", "thin film coverage", "through silicon via", "via metallization", "Argon", "Atomic layer deposition", "Silicon", "Sputtering", "Substrates", "Surface treatment", "Through-silicon vias", "Through Silicon Via (TSV)", "barrier/seed layer", "optimization", "sputtering", ""], "arnumber": "6787368"}
