However, due to the unique characteristics of AMI, such as complex network structure, resource-constrained smart meter, and privacy-sensitive data, it is an especially challenging issue to make AMI secure. Energy theft is one of the most important concerns related to the smart grid implementation. It is estimated that utility companies lose more than $25 billion every year due to energy theft around the world. To address this challenge, in this paper, we discuss the background of AMI and identify major security requirements that AMI should meet. Specifically, an attack tree based threat model is first presented to illustrate the energy-theft behaviors in AMI. Then, we summarize the current AMI energy-theft detection schemes into three categories, i.e., classification-based, state estimation-based, and game theory-based ones, and make extensive comparisons and discussions on them. In order to provide a deep understanding of security vulnerabilities and solutions in AMI and shed light on future research directions, we also explore some open challenges and potential solutions for energy-theft detection.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "105", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "120", "date_publication": "April 2014", "inspec": "15568235", "date": "April 2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 15 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "2", "pages": "105 - 120", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Rong Jiang", "Rongxing Lu", "Ye Wang", "Jun Luo", "Changxiang Shen", "Xuemin Sherman Shen"], "keywords": ["game theory", "metering", "power system measurement", "power system protection", "power system state estimation", "smart power grids", "AMI energy-theft detection Issue", "advanced metering infrastructure security", "classification-based AMI energy-theft detection", "first ubiquitous platform", "fixed computing platform", "game theory-based energy-theft detection", "security vulnerabilities", "smart grid proliferation", "state estimation-based energy-theft detection", "utility companies", "Companies", "Electricity", "Power system reliability", "Reliability", "Security", "Smart grids", "Wide area networks", "Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)", "energy-theft detection", "security", "smart grid", ""], "arnumber": "6787363"}
