It leads to practically efficient algorithms for many NP-hard problems and also provides a much finer complexity classification for other intractable problems. Although the theory is mostly on decision problems, parameterized complexity naturally extends to counting problems as well. The purpose of this article is to survey a few aspects of parameterized counting complexity, with a particular emphasis on some general frameworks in which parameterized complexity proves to be indispensable.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "410", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "420", "date_publication": "Aug. 2014", "inspec": "15568261", "date": "Aug. 2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Jul 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "4", "pages": "410 - 420", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Chihao Zhang", "Yijia Chen"], "keywords": ["computational complexity", "optimisation", "NP-hard problems", "computational problems", "counting problems", "finer complexity classification", "general frameworks", "intractable problems", "multivariate theory", "parameterized complexity", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Approximation algorithms", "Approximation methods", "Bipartite graph", "Complexity theory", "Heuristic algorithms", "Polynomials", "counting problems", "dichotomy theorems", "parameterized complexity", ""], "arnumber": "6867521"}
