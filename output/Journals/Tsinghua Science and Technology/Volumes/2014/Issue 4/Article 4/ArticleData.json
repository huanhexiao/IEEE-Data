Due it is theoretical and practical importance, the problem has been the subject of intensive study. Motivated by the parameter ecology program we attempt to classify the parameterized and kernelization complexity of FEEDBACK VERTEX SET for a wide range of parameters. We survey known results and present several new complexity classifications. For example, we prove that FEEDBACK VERTEX SET is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the vertex-deletion distance to a chordal graph. We also prove that the problem admits a polynomial kernel when parameterized by the vertex-deletion distance to a pseudo forest, a graph in which every connected component has at most one cycle. In contrast, we prove that a slightly smaller parameterization does not allow for a polynomial kernel unless NP \u2286 coNP=poly and the polynomial-time hierarchy collapses.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "387", "volume": "19", "lastpage": "409", "date_publication": "Aug. 2014", "inspec": "15568260", "date": "Aug. 2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Jul 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issue": "4", "pages": "387 - 409", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)"}, "authors": ["Bart M.
