This paper describes a magnetic-based CMOS-compatible RF inductor. Magnetic-core inductors with various ferrite-filled structures, spiral structures, and magnetic material permeabilities were simulated to show that this inductor greatly improves the inductance by up to 97% and quality factor by 18.6% over a multi-GHz frequency range. The results indicate that the inductor is a very promising and viable solution to realize miniature, high quality, and high frequency on-chip inductors for high-end RF ICs.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "78", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "83", "date_publication": "Feb. 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2012", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 01 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "78 - 83"}, "authors": ["Jing Zhan", "Tianling Ren", "Chen Yang", "Yi Yang", "Litian Liu", "Albert Wang"], "keywords": ["Ferrites", "Inductors", "Integrated circuit modeling", "Magnetic cores", "Permeability", "Radio frequency", "Integrated Circuits (ICs)", "Radio Frequency (RF)", "ferrite", "inductor", "magnetic-cored", ""], "arnumber": "6151911"}
