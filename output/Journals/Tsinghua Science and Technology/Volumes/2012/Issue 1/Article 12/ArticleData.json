In this work, a Random Matrix Theory (RMT) based method is used to describe the collective behavior from massive traffic data sets. Nonrandom correlations between traffic flow series recorded in the Beijing road network occur both with and without detrending. The effect of the traffic load on the correlation patterns of network-wide traffic flows is analyzed using the RMT analysis of a simulated data set collected from Paramics. The RMT analysis is also used to evaluate the impact of incidents on the network-wide traffic status. Cluster analysis is used to find the largest cluster in the network which indicates the critical congestion caused by the incident. All the results show that RMT analyses are an effective method for investigating systematic interactions in urban transportation systems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "104", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "112", "date_publication": "Feb. 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2012", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 01 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "104 - 112"}, "authors": ["Tingting Zhao", "Yi Zhang", "Bingyan Huang"], "keywords": ["Clustering methods", "Correlation", "Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions", "Random variables", "Telecommunication traffic", "Time series analysis", "cluster analysis", "cross-correlation", "eigenvalue", "impact analysis", "random matrix theory", ""], "arnumber": "6151914"}
