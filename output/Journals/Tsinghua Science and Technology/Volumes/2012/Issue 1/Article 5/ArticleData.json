This paper gives a probabilistic spatiotemporal fusion approach for video copy detection. This approach directly estimates the location of the copy segment with a probabilistic graphical model. The spatial and temporal consistency of the video copy is embedded in the local probability function. An effective local descriptor and a two-level descriptor pairing method are used to build a video copy detection system to evaluate the approach. Tests show that it outperforms the popular voting algorithm and the probabilistic fusion framework based on the Hidden Markov Model, improving F-score (F1) by 8%.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "51", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "59", "date_publication": "Feb. 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2012", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 01 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "51 - 59"}, "authors": ["Jianmin Li", "Yingyu Liang", "Bo Zhang"], "keywords": ["Computer graphics", "Content management", "Feature extraction", "Hidden Markov models", "Probabilistic logic", "Spatiotemporal phenomena", "Video equipment", "probabilistic graphical model", "spatiotemporal fusion model", "video copy detection", ""], "arnumber": "6151907"}
