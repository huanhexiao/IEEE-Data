A scheme was designed to compare the achievable rates of a single carrier system and an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) system. A thorough theoretical analysis of the two-path channel was conducted, and simulations were also used to analyze practical stochastic channels. Analysis and simulation results show that the achievable rates of the two approaches are comparable when the channel is flat fading. However, when the channel is frequency selective fading, the single carrier system outperforms the OFDM system. The achievable rate of the OFDM system is about 10% lower than that of the single carrier system at higher SNRs.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "73", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "77", "date_publication": "Feb. 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2012", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 01 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "73 - 77"}, "authors": ["Jiaqi Zhang", "Yukui Pei", "Ning Ge"], "keywords": ["Channel capacity", "Frequency modulation", "Hidden Markov models", "OFDM", "Phase shift keying", "Signal to noise ratio", "achievable rate", "channel state information at the receiver", "frequency selective channels", "orthogonal frequency division multiplexing", "single carrier", ""], "arnumber": "6151910"}
