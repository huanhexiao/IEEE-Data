An approximation of the hyperbolic secant function allows a simple derivation of a staged model that accounts for the complex frequency dependent parameters. The model converts the T-ladder network into a \u03a0-network with controlled sources. The equivalent circuit based approach presented here is not only intriguing but also enhances the computed accuracy and efficiency. Numerical simulations verify the accuracy of this approach for both time and frequency domain responses.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "84", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "93", "date_publication": "Feb. 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Feb. 2012", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 01 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "1", "pages": "84 - 93"}, "authors": ["Wenjun Zhang", "Ruinan Chang"], "keywords": ["Conductors", "Coupling circuits", "Equivalent circuits", "Integrated circuit modeling", "Mathematical model", "Reduced order systems", "Solid modeling", "approximations", "coupled transmission lines", "equivalent circuit", "model order reduction", ""], "arnumber": "6151912"}
