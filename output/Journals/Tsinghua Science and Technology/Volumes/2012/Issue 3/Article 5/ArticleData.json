However, traditional density-based approaches cannot effectively manage pages that contain short contents and long noises. To overcome this problem, in this paper, we propose a content extraction approach for obtaining content from news pages that combines a segmentation-like approach and a density-based approach. A tool called BlockExtractor was developed based on this approach. BlockExtractor identifies contents in three steps. First, it looks for all Block-Level Elements (BLE) & Inline Elements (IE) blocks, which are designed to roughly segment pages into blocks. Second, it computes the densities of each BLE&IE block and its element to eliminate noises. Third, it removes all redundant BLE&IE blocks that have emerged in other pages from the same site. Compared with three other density-based approaches, our approach shows significant advantages in both precision and recall.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "256", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "264", "date_publication": "June 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2012", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 15 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "256 - 264"}, "authors": ["Shuang Lin", "Jie Chen", "Zhendong Niu"], "keywords": ["HTML", "Information analysis", "Information retrieval", "Noise measurement", "Text mining", "Training", "Web mining", "Web pages", "content extraction", "density-based approach", "segmentation", ""], "arnumber": "6216755"}
