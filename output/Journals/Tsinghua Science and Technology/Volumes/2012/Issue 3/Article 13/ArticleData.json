Classical methods such as the Generalized Least Squares (GLS) method can have numerical problems with ill-conditioned sets which are common in practical applications. This paper describes an azimuth-GLS method that provides a solution to the ill-conditioning problem while maintaining reasonable accuracy compared with the classical GLS method. The mean square error is given for both methods as a criterion to determine when to use this azimuth-GLS method. Furthermore, the separation boundary between the azimuth-GLS favorable region and that of the GLS method is explicitly plotted. Extensive simulations show that the azimuth-GLS approach is preferable in most scenarios.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "319", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "323", "date_publication": "June 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2012", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 15 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "319 - 323"}, "authors": ["Xiongjie Du", "Yue Wang", "Xiuming Shan"], "keywords": ["Azimuth", "Data fusion", "Estimation", "Least squares approximation", "Noise measurement", "Sensors", "data fusion", "ill-conditioning", "sensor bias estimation", ""], "arnumber": "6216763"}
