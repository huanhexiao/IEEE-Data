The purpose of this paper is to automatically identify the sentence skeleton of Chinese sentences on the event level. Based on the event model, this paper discusses the relationship between events and concepts, and presents an event conceptualization method. It analyzes the event composition of Chinese sentences, classifies the relationships among events, and proposes a recursive description of the event composition of Chinese sentences. Based on these analyses, an algorithm for automatically identifying the sentence skeleton of Chinese sentences based on the event model is presented. The results of the final experiment show an 89% success rate, which demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is feasible and effective.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "248", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "255", "date_publication": "June 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2012", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 15 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "248 - 255"}, "authors": ["Wei Xu", "Ke Zhao", "Zhenzhen Yi", "Yatao Li", "Peitao Cheng"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Analytical models", "Data structures", "Natural languages", "Semantics", "Text analysis", "conceptualization", "event", "event model", "sentence skeleton", ""], "arnumber": "6216754"}
