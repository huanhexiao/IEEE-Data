The system employs a thermal camera for robust human body segmentation to handle the complex background and varying illumination posed by the projector. A fast and robust hand localization algorithm is proposed, with which the head, torso, and arm are sequentially localized. Hand trajectories are segmented and recognized as gestures for interactions. A dual-step calibration algorithm is utilized to map the interaction regions between the thermal camera and the projected contents by integrating a Web camera. Experiments show that the system has a high recognition rate for hand gestures, and corresponding interactions can be performed correctly.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "329", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "336", "date_publication": "June 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2012", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 15 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "329 - 336"}, "authors": ["Bobo Zeng", "Guijin Wang", "Xinggang Lin"], "keywords": ["Calibration", "Cameras", "Gesture recognition", "Image segmentation", "Real time systems", "Robustness", "Trajectory", "gesture recognition", "hand gesture detection", "interactive presentation", "thermal camera", ""], "arnumber": "6216765"}
