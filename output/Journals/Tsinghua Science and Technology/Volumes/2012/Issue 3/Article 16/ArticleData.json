The method combines periodic plus smooth image decomposition with complex wavelet packet transforms. The framework first decomposes a degraded satellite image into the sum of a \u201cperiodic component\u201d and a \u201csmooth component\u201d. The Bayesian method is then used to estimate the modulation transfer function degradation parameters and the noise. The periodic component is deconvoluted using complex wavelet packet transforms with the deconvolution result of the periodic component then combined with the smooth component to get the final recovered result. Tests show that this strategy effectively avoids ringing artifacts while preserving local image details (especially directional textures) without amplifying the noise. Quantitative comparisons illustrate that the results are comparable with previous methods. Another benefit is that this approach can process large satellite images with parallel processing, which is important for practical use.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "337", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "343", "date_publication": "June 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2012", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 15 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "337 - 343"}, "authors": ["Yan Zhang", "Yiyun Man"], "keywords": ["Deconvolution", "Image restoration", "Noise measurement", "Satellite communication", "Wavelet packets", "adaptive restoration", "complex wavelet packet transform", "deconvolution", "periodic plus smooth image decomposition", "signal composition", ""], "arnumber": "6216766"}
