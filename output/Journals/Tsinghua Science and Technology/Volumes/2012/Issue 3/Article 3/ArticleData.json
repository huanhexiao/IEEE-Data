To make full use of the document and collection information, this paper introduces a new information retrieval model that relies on the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. Each query-document pair is taken as a piece of evidence for the relevance between a document and a query. The evidence is combined using Dempster's rule of combination, and the belief committed to the relevance is obtained. Retrieved documents are then ranked according to the belief committed to the relevance. Several basic probability assignments are also proposed. Extensive experiments over the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) test collection ClueWeb09 show that the proposed model provides performance similar to that of the Vector Space Model (VSM). Under certain probability assignments, the proposed model outperforms the VSM by 63% in terms of mean average precision.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "241", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "247", "date_publication": "June 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2012", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 15 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "241 - 247"}, "authors": ["Jiuling Zhang", "Beixing Deng", "Xing Li"], "keywords": ["Abstracts", "Collaboration", "Indexing", "Information analysis", "Information retrieval", "Probabilistic logic", "Dempster's rule of combination", "Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence", "basic probability assignment", ""], "arnumber": "6216753"}
