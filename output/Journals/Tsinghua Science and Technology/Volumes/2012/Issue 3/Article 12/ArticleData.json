The channel is modulated in advance to avoid damage to the original states in this scheme, which is caused by the inevitable failure of constructing a channel between the sender and the receiver. The scheme is flexible because the channel can be modulated either by the sender or by the receiver, with the option of deciding whether the sender or the receiver modulates the channel, according to the distribution of the available particle resources. The efficiency can be improved by reusing previously discarded results that may lead to a faithful channel. The scheme can be uniformly performed, so the design process can be greatly simplified to realize a reliable deterministic teleportation. Finally, the scheme is extended to deterministic teleportation of an arbitrary n-qubit state in a generalized form.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "313", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "318", "date_publication": "June 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2012", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 15 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "313 - 318"}, "authors": ["Hui Li", "Chunwen Li", "Rebing Wu"], "keywords": ["Atmospheric measurements", "Modulation", "Particle measurements", "Probabilistic logic", "Quantum entanglement", "Receivers", "Teleportation", "auxiliary particle", "channel modulation", "deterministic teleportation", "one-dimensional four-qubit cluster state", "probabilistic channel", ""], "arnumber": "6216762"}
