First, a set of primitives is abstracted from program statements. Then, data transfer bandwidth and power consumption in different granularity sizes are considered and mapped into proper primitives. With these mappings, a programmer can intuitively determine the power efficiency and performance in different running states of a thread. Finally, this intuition enables the programmer to tune the algorithm in order to achieve the best energy efficiency and performance. Using these power-aware principles, two Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) methods are compared. The mapping between power consumption and primitives is helpful for algorithm tuning in source-code levels.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "278", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "286", "date_publication": "June 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2012", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 15 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "278 - 286"}, "authors": ["Changyou Zhang", "Kun Huang", "Xiang Cui", "Yifeng Chen"], "keywords": ["Accelerators", "Energy efficiency", "Graphics processing unit", "Message systems", "Power demand", "Power measurement", "Resource management", "GPU", "power-aware", "primitive", "source-code", ""], "arnumber": "6216757"}
