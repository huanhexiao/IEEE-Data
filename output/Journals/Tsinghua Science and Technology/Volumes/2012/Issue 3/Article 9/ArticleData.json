The two critical parameters of the travel delay and queue length, which reflect the temporal and spatial properties of incident-induced congestion, cannot be directly determined from commonly used loop sensors. The modified queuing diagram is used here to quantify incident-induced queues and travel delays on signalized arteries using sensor data from the targeted and upstream links. The method is tested using data generated by the VISSIM simulation model, with results indicating its efficiency and accuracy with an average relative travel delay error of 18.67% for all samples which falls to 8.07% for high volume and very high volume conditions.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "296", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "303", "date_publication": "June 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "June 2012", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 15 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "3", "pages": "296 - 303"}, "authors": ["Lin Hou", "Zuo Zhang", "Binghao Lu", "Runmin Xu", "Yi Zhang"], "keywords": ["Accidents", "Data models", "Detectors", "Queueing analysis", "Road vehicles", "Traffic control", "Urban areas", "queue length", "signalized intersections", "traffic incident", "travel delay", ""], "arnumber": "6216759"}
