Fast progress in high-throughput technologies and the production of large amounts of data enable the discovery of essential proteins at the system level by analyzing Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks, and replacing biological or chemical experiments. Furthermore, additional gene-level annotation information, such as Gene Ontology (GO) terms, helps to detect essential proteins with higher accuracy. Various centrality algorithms have been used to determine essential proteins in a PPI network, and, recently motif centrality GO, which is based on network motifs and GO terms, works best in detecting essential proteins in a Baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae PPI network, compared to other centrality algorithms. However, each centrality algorithm contributes to the detection of essential proteins with different properties, which makes the integration of them a logical next step. In this paper, we construct a new feature space, named CENT-ING-GO consisting of various centrality measures and GO terms, and provide a computational approach to predict essential proteins with various machine learning techniques. The experimental results show that CENT-ING-GO feature space improves performance over the INT-GO feature space in previous work by Acencio and Lemke in 2009. We also demonstrate that pruning a PPI with informative GO terms can improve the prediction performance further.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "645", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "658", "date_publication": "Dec. 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2012", "date_current_version": "Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "645 - 658"}, "authors": ["Wooyoung Kim"], "keywords": ["Extraterrestrial measurements", "Feature extraction", "Machine learning", "Ontologies", "Prediction algorithms", "Proteins", "CENT-ING-GO", "Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI)", "centrality algorithm", "essential protein", "gene ontology", "machine learning", "motif centrality GO", "network motif", ""], "arnumber": "6374366"}
