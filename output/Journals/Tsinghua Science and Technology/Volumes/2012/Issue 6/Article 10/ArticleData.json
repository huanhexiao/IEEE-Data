Our method employs an ensemble of RNA folding tools and a filtering heuristic to generate a set of pseudoknot-free stems, and then predicts pseudoknots by utilizing a search technique with a pseudo-probability scoring scheme. Experimental results show that KnotFold achieves higher sensitivity than existing methods.
