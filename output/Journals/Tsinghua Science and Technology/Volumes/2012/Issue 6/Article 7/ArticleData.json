Extraction of differential expression genes or construction of decision rules using these skewed datasets by traditional algorithms will seriously underestimate the performance of the minority class, leading to inaccurate diagnosis in clinical trails. This paper presents a skewed gene selection algorithm that introduces a weighted metric into the gene selection procedure. The extracted genes are paired as decision rules to distinguish both classes, with these decision rules then integrated into an ensemble learning framework by majority voting to recognize test examples; thus avoiding tedious data normalization and classifier construction. The mining and integrating of a few reliable decision rules gave higher or at least comparable classification performance than many traditional class imbalance learning algorithms on four benchmark imbalanced cancer gene expression datasets.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "666", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "673", "date_publication": "Dec. 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Dec. 2012", "date_current_version": "Wed Dec 05 00:00:00 EST 2012", "issue": "6", "pages": "666 - 673"}, "authors": ["Hualong Yu", "Jun Ni", "Yuanyuan Dan", "Sen Xu"], "keywords": ["Cancer", "Colon", "Data mining", "Gene expression", "Genetics", "Lungs", "Prediction algorithms", "Tumors", "cancer gene expression data", "class imbalance", "decision rule", "ensemble learning", "majority voting", "paired differential expression genes", ""], "arnumber": "6374368"}
