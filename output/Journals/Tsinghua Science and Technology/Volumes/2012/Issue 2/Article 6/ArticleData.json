The smartphone includes an atmospheric pressure sensor to measure the user's altitude that is combined with the outdoor Global Positioning System (GPS) and indoor WiFi-APs localization systems in a seamless 3-D localization system. The smartphone software also provides seamless navigation services by updating map information for both indoor and outdoor locations through the mobile Internet. The indoor floor information calculated from the altitude information is used to project localization anchor nodes, e.g., WiFi-AP, on different floors onto the user's floor with an indoor 3-D localization algorithm using projection distances based on a Received Signal Strength (RSS) algorithm. Tests show that the 3-D method reduces systematic errors and achieves much higher accuracy than the traditional two-dimensional localization method.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "172", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "178", "date_publication": "April 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2012", "date_current_version": "Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "172 - 178"}, "authors": ["Nengqiang He", "Jinhai Huo", "Yuhan Dong", "Yipeng Li", "Yang Yu", "Yong Ren"], "keywords": ["Atmospheric measurements", "Global Positioning System", "Localization", "Mobile communication", "Smart phones", "Three dimensional displays", "Web and internet services", "3-D localization and navigation", "atmospheric pressure", "mobile Internet", "mobile smartphone", ""], "arnumber": "6180042"}
