The imaging processing of the microscopic powder image is very complex because of the low contrast, blurry boundaries, overlapping objects, and messy background. Therefore, the object detection must segment the significant microscopic structures from the complex image. The objects are detected in these images using an adaptable interactive method. After identifying the significant microscopic structures, the system identifies 14 features belonging to three main characteristics. These features form a 14-dimensional vector that represents the microscopic structures. The multi-dimensional vector is then analyzed using a feature assignment algorithm that picks the most notable features to construct a decision tree with thresholds. The identification system consists of a coarse classifier based on the decision tree and a fine classifier using similarity measurements to rank the possible results. Tests on 528 images from 24 different kinds of microscopic structures show the system effectiveness and applicability.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "209", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "217", "date_publication": "April 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2012", "date_current_version": "Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "209 - 217"}, "authors": ["Shen Yan", "Yaoli Li", "Yixu Song", "Li Lin", "Peifa Jia", "Shaoqing Cai"], "keywords": ["Biomedical imaging", "Feature extraction", "Image color analysis", "Image segmentation", "Microscopy", "Object detection", "Powders", "Chinese Materia Medicas", "microscopic characteristics", "microscopic images", "object detection", "texture characteristics", ""], "arnumber": "6180047"}
