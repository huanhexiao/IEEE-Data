However, trust management frameworks themselves are vulnerable to attacks. Attacks against trust management frameworks are described in this paper with a trust management framework to resist them. The trustworthiness between nodes is evaluated to classify node behavior using a three-dimensional classifier based on a fuzzy integral. Different behaviors are mapped to different behavioral spaces to detect malicious nodes and identify their behavior types. The security of ad hoc networks is then improved by various measures to handle different types of malicious behavior. Simulations of the model on the System In The Loop (SITL) platform show that this trust management framework can separate normal nodes and malicious nodes and can distinguish different types of malicious nodes.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "179", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "185", "date_publication": "April 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2012", "date_current_version": "Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "179 - 185"}, "authors": ["Li Yu", "Zuhao Liu", "Yuan Gao", "Dudu Samba"], "keywords": ["Ad hoc networks", "Authentication", "Behavioral science", "Fuzzy models", "Network security", "Peer to peer computing", "Streaming media", "System In The Loop (SITL)", "ad hoc networks", "behavior space", "fuzzy integral", "trust routing", ""], "arnumber": "6180043"}
