Three different transmission schemes, (1) a traditional flow-based scheme, (2) a network coding scheme, and (3) the PNC scheme are compared to show that the PNC scheme improves wireless network throughput by a constant factor without changing the scaling law compared to the traditional flow-based and network coding schemes. Furthermore, PNC can reduce the effect of interference for the one-dimensional networks, and has a tighter throughput bound for the two-dimensional network.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "161", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "171", "date_publication": "April 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2012", "date_current_version": "Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "161 - 171"}, "authors": ["Xican Yang", "Jian Li", "Changliang Xie", "Li Li"], "keywords": ["Encoding", "Interference", "Network coding", "Receivers", "Throughput", "Transmitters", "Wireless networks", "delay", "physical-layer network coding", "throughput", ""], "arnumber": "6180041"}
