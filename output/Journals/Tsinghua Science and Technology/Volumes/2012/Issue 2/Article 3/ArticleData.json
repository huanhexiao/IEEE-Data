We offer evidence that relationships and behavior co-evolve in a student dormitory, based on monthly surveys and location tracking through resident cellular phones over a period of nine months. We demonstrate that a Markov jump process could capture the co-evolution in terms of the rates at which residents visit places and friends. Our co-evolution model will be useful in bridging sensor networks data and organizational dynamics theories, simulating different ways to shape behavior and relationships, and turning mobile phone data into data products.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "136", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "151", "date_publication": "April 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "April 2012", "date_current_version": "Fri Apr 20 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "2", "pages": "136 - 151"}, "authors": ["Wen Dong", "Bruno Lepri", "Sandy Pentland"], "keywords": ["Behavioral science", "Computational modeling", "Correlation", "Data models", "Mobile handsets", "Multiagent systems", "Social network services", "Wireless sensor networks", "human dynamics", "living labs", "multi-agent model", "organizational dynamics", "sensor networks", "social computing", "stochastic process", ""], "arnumber": "6180039"}
