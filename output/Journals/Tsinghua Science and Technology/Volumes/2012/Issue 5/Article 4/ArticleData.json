In such a system, it is more desirable for mobile readers to identify tags without a back-end server, and thus it is frequently referred as a serverless mobile RFID system. In this paper, we formalize a serverless mobile RFID system model and propose a new encryption-based system that preserves the privacy of both tags and readers in the model. In addition, we define a new adversary model for the system model and show the security of the proposed system. Throughout comparisons between ours and the other alternatives, we show that our proposed system provides a stronger reader privacy and robustness against a reader forgery attack than the competitors.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "521", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "536", "date_publication": "Oct. 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2012", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 28 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "521 - 536"}, "authors": ["Jiwhan Lim", "Sangjin Kim", "Heekuck Oh", "Donghyun Kim"], "keywords": ["Encryption", "Mobile communication", "Network security", "Privacy", "Protocols", "Query procressing", "Radiofrequency identification", "Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID)", "designated query protocol", "encryption-based", "reader privacy", "serverless", ""], "arnumber": "6314529"}
