While conventional sensor nodes possessed only one radio interface, next generation sensor nodes are expected to have two (possibly more) radio interfaces, each with different ranges, capacities, and power consumptions. Equipping sensor nodes with dual radios has its own benefits and can be quite useful in handling bursty traffic while at the same time satisfying the application's delivery requirements. In this paper, we propose an adaptive interface switch agent that intelligently selects the interface to be used for data transmission at a sensor node based on the data burst length or end-to-end delay while taking into consideration power consumption and throughput. The proposed work generalizes earlier works in this area to enable both the source nodes and intermediate data forwarding nodes to initiate the activation of high power radios so that they can be utilized to a higher degree for converge-cast communication. We have performed extensive simulations with sensor nodes containing both IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11 compatible radios. Our simulation results indicate that the switch agent yields throughput, delay, and packet delivery ratio comparable to the higher bandwidth interface alone, without incurring much energy wastage.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "586", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "598", "date_publication": "Oct. 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2012", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 28 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "586 - 598"}, "authors": ["Tao Zheng", "Sridhar Radhakrishnan", "Venkatesh Sarangan"], "keywords": ["Bandwidth", "Dual radios", "IEEE 802.11 Standards", "IEEE 802.15 Standards", "Peer to peer computing", "Protocols", "Routing", "Wireless sensor networks", "IEEE 802.11", "IEEE 802.15.4", "dual radios", "switch agent", "wireless sensor networks", ""], "arnumber": "6314534"}
