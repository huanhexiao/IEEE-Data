The simple yet effective design of P-MAC offers strict service differentiation for prioritized packets. A Markov model is developed to yield important performance matrices including the packet blocking probability due to queue overflow and the packet reneging probability due to delay bound. It is further proved that the service time of P-MAC approximates exponential distribution, and can be effectively estimated. The analytic models with preemptive and non-preemptive schemes, validated via simulations, show that P-MAC can effectively support traffic differentiation and achieve very low packet dropping (both reneging and blocking) probabilities when the traffic load is below the channel capacity. When the network is overloaded, P-MAC can still maintain extremely stable and high channel throughput. Moreover, it is demonstrated that P-MAC performs superior in multihop networks, further proving the advantages of the proposed protocol.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "537", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "552", "date_publication": "Oct. 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Oct. 2012", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 28 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "5", "pages": "537 - 552"}, "authors": ["Lei Pan", "Hongyi Wu"], "keywords": ["IEEE 802.11e Standard", "Markov processes", "Media Access Protocol", "Mesh networks", "Quality of service", "Routing protocols", "Synchronization", "Wireless networks", "Markov chain", "Quality-of-Service (QoS)", "binary countdown", "medium access control", "network throughput", "packet priorization", "reneging", "wireless mesh networks", "wireless routers", ""], "arnumber": "6314530"}
