In sparse multi-dimensional data, many dimensions are irrelevant and obscure the cluster boundaries. Subspace clustering helps by mining the clusters present in only locally relevant subsets of dimensions. However, understanding the result of subspace clustering by analysts is not trivial. In addition to the grouping information, relevant sets of dimensions and overlaps between groups, both in terms of dimensions and records, need to be analyzed. We introduce a visual subspace cluster analysis system called ClustNails. It integrates several novel visualization techniques with various user interaction facilities to support navigating and interpreting the result of subspace clustering. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system by applying it to the analysis of real world data and comparing it with existing visual subspace cluster analysis systems.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "419", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "428", "date_publication": "Aug. 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2012", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 07 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "419 - 428"}, "authors": ["Andrada Tatu", "Leishi Zhang", "Enrico Bertini", "Tobias Schreck", "Daniel Keim", "Sebastian Bremm", "Tatiana von Landesberger"], "keywords": ["Algorithm design and analysis", "Clustering algorithms", "Data mining", "Data visualization", "Heating", "Image color analysis", "Visualization", "data exploration", "pixel-based techniques", "subspace cluster analysis", "visualization", ""], "arnumber": "6297588"}
