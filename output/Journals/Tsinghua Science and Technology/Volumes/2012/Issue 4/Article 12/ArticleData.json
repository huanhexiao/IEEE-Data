They provide a much tighter fit than the regular ellipses/ellipsoids. The most important operation involved is to compute the closest/farthest point, on a given ellipse/ellipsoid, with respect to a user specified point. In this paper, we first formulate such a problem for the ellipse case into solving a quartic equation and then for the ellipsoid case by solving a system of quartic equations. The method proposed in this paper is elegant and highly efficient.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "481", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "484", "date_publication": "Aug. 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2012", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 07 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "481 - 484"}, "authors": ["Shuangmin Chen", "Shiqing Xin", "Ying He", "Guojin Wang"], "keywords": ["Ellipsoids", "Equations", "Graphics", "Mathematical model", "Ray tracing", "bounding volume", "closest point", "collision detection", "ellipse", "ellipsoid", "farthest point", ""], "arnumber": "6297594"}
