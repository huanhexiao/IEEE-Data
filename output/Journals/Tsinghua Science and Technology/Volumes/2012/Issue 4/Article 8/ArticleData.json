As a large financial institution, Bank of America relies on effective risk analyses to minimize the net credit loss resulting from its credit products (e.g., mortgage and credit card loans). Due to the size and complexity of the data involved in this process, analysts are facing challenges in monitoring the data, comparing its geospatial and temporal patterns, and developing appropriate strategies based on the correlation from multiple analysis perspectives. To address these challenges, we present RiskVA, an interactive visual analytics system that is tailored to support credit risk analysis. RiskVA provides interactive data exploration and correlation, and visually facilitates depictions of market fluctuations and temporal trends for a targeted credit product. When evaluated by analysts from Bank of America, RiskVA was appreciated for its effectiveness in facilitating the bank's risk management.", "journal_title": "Tsinghua Science and Technology", "firstpage": "440", "volume": "17", "lastpage": "451", "date_publication": "Aug. 2012", "sponsor": "Tsinghua University Press (TUP)", "date": "Aug. 2012", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 07 00:00:00 EDT 2012", "issue": "4", "pages": "440 - 451"}, "authors": ["Xiaoyu Wang", "Dong Jeong", "Remco Chang", "William Ribarsky"], "keywords": ["Complexity theory", "Consumer protection", "Investments", "Market research", "Risk management", "Visual analytics", "design study", "human computer interaction", "risk management", "visual analytics", ""], "arnumber": "6297590"}
