Considering the legal rules in Ontario, Canada, a 500-W electric motor providing power assist makes the E-bike more attractive to urban commuters. The simple structure, high torque, and power density, as well as the potential for low cost make the switched reluctance machine (SRM) a strong candidate for E-bike traction. In this paper, a three-phase, external-rotor SRM with 6 stator poles and 10 rotor poles is designed for a representative E-bike. The design of an external rotor arrangement of the 6-10 SRM topology has not previously been reported, this brings the challenge of sizing the geometry of this topology, but the solution offers a new contribution to published works. The external-rotor arrangement is chosen to facilitate ease of integration into the wheel hub structure of a typical pedal bicycle. The increased rotor poles yield improved torque ripple reduction than more conventional (i.e., 6-4 and 12-8) SRM design, which is an essential feature for low-speed rider comfort. The final machine design is experimentally validated via a full system prototype and dynamometer test facility. Results highlight some limitation of the 2-D finite element analysis (FEA) study in terms of the winding inductance calculation, more accurate 3-D FEA model is implemented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "348", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "356", "date_publication": "Fri Nov 20 00:00:00 EST 2015", "inspec": "15697255", "date": "Dec. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 11 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "4", "pages": "348 - 356"}, "authors": ["Jianing Lin", "Nigel Schofield", "Ali Emadi"], "keywords": ["bicycles", "electric motors", "electric vehicles", "finite element analysis", "reluctance motors", "rotors", "stators", "10 rotor poles", "2-D finite element analysis", "3-D FEA model", "6 stator poles", "SRM", "electric bicycle", "electric motor", "external-rotor 6-10 switched reluctance motor", "pedal bicycle", "switched reluctance machine", "torque ripple reduction", "wheel hub structure", "winding inductance calculation", "Bicycles", "Finite element analysis", "Prototypes", "Switched reluctance motors", "Electric bicycles", "Electric bicycles (E-bikes)", "end winding", "finite element analysis (FEA)", "machine design", "prototype machine", "switched reluctance motor", ""], "arnumber": "7332794"}
