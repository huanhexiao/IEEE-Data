The proposed power split control strategy consists of two stages. In the first stage, the load power is split between the two propulsion machines to obtain the highest powertrain efficiency in both propulsion and regenerative braking modes. A real-time implementable power split control strategy is proposed to benefit from complementary operation features of these two propulsion machines. In the second stage, the load power is split between the battery pack and UC in the HESS. To optimize the power split in HESS, a convex optimization problem is formulated to minimize the battery power magnitude and battery current variations to extend the battery lifetime. The implementation of proposed power split control strategy in the powertrain of an EV with two propulsion machines will potentially result in up to 10% improvement in the powertrain efficiency and up to 82% extension of the battery lifetime. The improvement of propulsion efficiency will in turn lead to up to 27% extension of all-electric driving range.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "382", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "390", "date_publication": "Mon Nov 30 00:00:00 EST 2015", "inspec": "15697256", "date": "Dec. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 11 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "4", "pages": "382 - 390"}, "authors": ["Huseyin Ayhan Yavasoglu", "Junyi Shen", "Chuan Shi", "Metin Gokasan", "Alireza Khaligh"], "keywords": ["electric propulsion", "electric vehicles", "power control", "power transmission (mechanical)", "regenerative braking", "supercapacitors", "HESS", "battery current variations", "battery lifetime", "battery power magnitude", "battery-ultracapacitor", "convex optimization problem", "electric vehicle powertrain", "hybrid energy storage system", "load power", "propulsion machines", "real-time implementable power split control", "regenerative braking modes", "Convex functions", "Electric vehicles", "Energy management", "Energy storage", "Mechanical power transmission", "Optimization", "Propulsion", "Convex optimization", "Electric vehicles", "convex optimization", "electric vehicles (EVs)", "energy management", "hybrid energy storage system", "hybrid energy storage system (HESS)", "ultra-capacitor", "ultra-capacitor (UC)", ""], "arnumber": "7339713"}
