This paper proposes a high-fidelity and computationally efficient electrothermally coupled model for interior permanent-magnet machines (IPMs) in electric vehicle (EV) traction applications. First, a high-fidelity IPM model accounting magnetic saturation, spatial harmonics, iron loss, and temperature effects is presented. The temperature effects on both the dand q-axis flux-linkages and the torque in the proposed model are quantified. The IPM model with due account of temperature effect is integrated with a state-space lumped parameter thermal model to establish a high-fidelity and computationally efficient electrothermally coupled model for IPMs. Both the steady-state and driving cycle operations are simulated with the proposed model and the results are compared to those predicted by the machine model without considering temperature effect as well as by the machine model which only accounts for the temperature effect on the winding resistance. Considerable temperature differences between those predicted by the proposed model and those predicted by the latter two models are observed. Experimental validation of the proposed model is performed with a 10-kW IPM prototype machine operating in generating mode.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "336", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "347", "date_publication": "Fri Sep 11 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "inspec": "15697250", "date": "Dec. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 11 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "4", "pages": "336 - 347"}, "authors": ["Xiao Chen", "Jiabin Wang", "Antonio Griffo"], "keywords": ["electric vehicles", "iron", "permanent magnet machines", "traction", "Fe", "IPM prototype machine", "d-axis flux-linkages", "electric vehicle traction", "electrothermally coupled model", "interior permanent-magnet machines", "iron loss", "irreversible demagnetization", "magnetic saturation", "power 10 kW", "q-axis flux-linkages", "spatial harmonics", "state-space lumped parameter thermal model", "temperature effects", "Computational modeling", "Electric vehicles", "Electromagnetics", "Permanent magnet machines", "Saturation magnetization", "Torque", "Driving cycles", "Electro-thermally coupled model", "driving cycles", "electrothermally coupled model", "interior permanent-magnet machine", "interior permanent-magnet machine (IPM)", "temperature effects", ""], "arnumber": "7258372"}
