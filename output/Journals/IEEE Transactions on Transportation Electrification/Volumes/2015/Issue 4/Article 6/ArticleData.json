The concept of differential power processing (DPP) is utilized to realize a high-efficiency lightweight converter that performs maximum power point tracking (MPPT) to transfer power from the aircraft's wing-mounted solar array to the high-voltage lithium-battery bus. The isolated C\u0301uk topology is augmented with an unfolder to achieve four quadrant operation and minimize the worst-case processed power. A small-signal model is derived for control design, and it is shown that the compensation strategy differs significantly based on the operating mode. The 2.7-kW prototype is verified at a high frequency (200 kHz), high efficiency (>98%), small mass (0.604 kg), and uses no electrolytic capacitors. MPPT operation is verified on a 376-V commercial solar installation. The DPP C\u0301uk converter is promising for emerging solar aerospace applications.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "369", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "381", "date_publication": "Thu Dec 03 00:00:00 EST 2015", "inspec": "15697257", "date": "Dec. 2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 14 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "4", "pages": "369 - 381"}, "authors": ["Ahmad Diab-Marzouk", "Olivier Trescases"], "keywords": ["aircraft power systems", "electrolytic capacitors", "lithium", "maximum power point trackers", "secondary cells", "silicon compounds", "solar powered vehicles", "wide band gap semiconductors", "Li", "MPPT", "SiC", "bidirectional C&#x0301", "uk converter", "dc-dc converter", "differential power processing", "electrolytic capacitors", "frequency 200 kHz", "high-efficiency lightweight converter", "high-voltage lithium-battery bus", "manned solar aircraft", "maximum power point tracking", "power 2.7 kW", "small-signal model", "solar aerospace", "solar powered aircraft", "solarship", "voltage 376 V", "wing-mounted solar array", "Aerospace engineering", "Aircraft", "DC-DC power converters", "Lithium batteries", "Maximum power point trackers", "Photovoltaic systems", "Aerospace", "DC???DC converter", "differential power processing (DPP)", "electric aircraft", "lightweight", "photovoltaic converters", ""], "arnumber": "7346500"}
