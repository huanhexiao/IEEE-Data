For this study, a MATLAB-based software tool, real EV cycle (REV-cycle) analyzer, is developed. The real-world driving data are recorded from the I-80 highway, CA, USA. In this study, driving cycles are classified into three styles as aggressive, mild, and gentle driving based on their average acceleration. Also, two standard driving cycles (EUDC and HWFET) are simulated by the software and the results are compared. The results show that the real driving cycles are very different from the standard cycles. Also, it is observed that the traffic flow affects the driving style, as the drivers tend to drive more aggressive during the light traffic hours of the highway, while the heavy traffic limits the driver's aggressive behavior. On the other hand, the driving style has considerable effect on the energy consumption and the battery aging. The aggressive driving style demands higher average power from the battery compared to the mild and gentle driving style. From the aging point of view, the aggressive driving style leads to higher Crate demand from the battery and it expedited the capacity fade process compared to the mild and gentle driving styles.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "391", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "401", "date_publication": "Tue Sep 29 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "inspec": "15697252", "date": "Dec. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 11 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "4", "pages": "391 - 401"}, "authors": ["Mehdi Jafari", "Antonio Gauchia", "Kuilin Zhang", "Lucia Gauchia"], "keywords": ["electric vehicles", "power consumption", "road traffic", "secondary cells", "EUDC standard driving cycles", "EV battery aging", "EV battery performance", "HWFET standard driving cycles", "Matlab-based software tool", "REV-cycle analyzer", "crate demand", "data analysis", "driver aggressive behavior", "electric vehicle", "energy consumption", "real EV cycle analyzer", "real-world driving styles", "traffic flow", "Aging", "Batteries", "Electric vehicles", "Simulation", "Aging", "aging", "battery", "driving style", "electric vehicle", "electric vehicle (EV)", ""], "arnumber": "7283664"}
