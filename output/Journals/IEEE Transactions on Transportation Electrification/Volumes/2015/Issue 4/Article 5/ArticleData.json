The main emphasis is given on high-frequency dc-ac and ac-dc wireless power transfer stage where the inversion stage is current-fed topology. The required resonance in transmitter side is (C) (LC) type and in the receiver-side series (LC) type. The proposed resonance tank network reduces the inverter switch stress to half of the conventional (L) (C) parallel resonance tank network. Inductor in dc-link provides natural short-circuit protection during inverter fault. The required high-transmitter coil (TC) current for air core coupled inductor circulates through parallel resonating capacitor which reduces inverter switch current stress. Resonant converter provides soft switching at device turn ON which reduces switching loss. Also, soft recovery at bridge rectifier eliminates diode reverse recovery loss. The converter is analyzed and simulated using PSIM 9.3. A proof-of-concept 420-W lab-prototype is designed and developed, and hardware results are added to validate the analysis and simulation results.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "357", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "368", "date_publication": "Tue Sep 22 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "inspec": "15697251", "date": "Dec. 2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 11 00:00:00 EST 2016", "issue": "4", "pages": "357 - 368"}, "authors": ["Suvendu Samanta", "Akshay Kumar Rathore"], "keywords": ["electric vehicles", "inductive power transmission", "resonant power convertors", "LC receiver topology", "air core coupled inductor", "bridge rectifier", "current-fed CLC transmitter topology", "current-fed topology", "electric vehicle charging application", "high-frequency ac-dc wireless power transfer stage", "high-frequency dc-ac wireless power transfer stage", "inductive wireless power transfer", "inverter switch stress", "parallel resonance tank network", "parallel resonating capacitor", "power 420 W", "resonant converter", "soft recovery", "soft switching", "Capacitors", "Electric vehicles", "Receivers", "Switches", "Transmitters", "Wireless power transfer", "Current-Fed Converter", "Current-fed converter", "Electric Vehicle", "Inductive power transfer", "Receiver Coil", "Softswitching", "Transmitter Coil", "Wireless power transfer", "electric vehicle (EV)", "inductive power transfer (IPT)", "receiver coil (RC)", "soft-switching", "transmitter coil (TC)", "wireless power transfer", ""], "arnumber": "7273944"}
