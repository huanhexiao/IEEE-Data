Stringent government regulations alongside persistent pressure from environmental groups will further increase the demand and sales of such vehicles. This trend might put pressure on the grid and local power distribution circuits and transformers. A sudden increase in power consumption, mainly caused by people charging their vehicles at the same time, and during the already peak load on the utility, may cause problems. These problems are mainly caused by the heavy demand on the local voltage transformers and the power sources. Power generation and distribution utilities may need to incur significant cost increases if this problem is not handled appropriately. In this paper, we present a novel design and implementation logic for a smart grid system that allows for dynamic interaction between electric/PEVs and the power grid. This smart and dynamic interaction will allow for safe and semi-stable load on the grid and thus minimizing the cost and preventing damage caused by the excessive loads. The complete system design is presented in this paper with emphasis on the developed algorithms. It has been implemented and tested on the Chrysler's PEV RAM 1500 U.S. Department of Energy pickup trucks.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "18", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "25", "date_publication": "Tue May 05 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "inspec": "15343122", "date": "June 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Jul 10 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "18 - 25"}, "authors": ["Rami Abousleiman", "Richard Scholer"], "keywords": ["electric vehicles", "power consumption", "power distribution economics", "power generation economics", "power transformers", "smart power grids", "electric vehicle smart charging", "local power distribution circuit cost", "local voltage transformer", "plug-in electric vehicles", "power consumption", "power distribution utilities", "power generation utilities", "smart power grid system design", "Batteries", "Companies", "Electric vehicles", "Hardware", "System-on-chip", "Electric Vehicles", "Electric vehicles", "Grid Balance and Optimization", "Smart Charging", "Smart Grid", "grid balance and optimization", "smart charging", "smart grid", ""], "arnumber": "7101876"}
