The topology employed here is one of the main candidates for future more electric aircraft (MEA). A detailed mathematical model is developed and comprehensive EPS modal analysis is performed. Eigenvalue sensitivity and participation factor are utilized to assess the effect of machine and control parameters, as well as system operating conditions, on EPS stability. Furthermore, this paper also presents comparative analysis of system models with and without the inclusion of system cabling. This crucial analysis shows that the tendencies in stability behavior can be significantly different with and without cabling. It is, therefore, shown that system simplification, by removal of cabling, can deliver remarkably misleading results. Time domain simulations are carried out to support the theoretical analysis. The comprehensive analysis presented in this paper provides EPS designers with an extremely useful methodology for the selection of appropriate EPS parameters at the early design stages.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "65", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "76", "date_publication": "Mon May 04 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "inspec": "15343120", "date": "June 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Jul 10 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "65 - 76"}, "authors": ["Fei Gao", "Xiancheng Zheng", "Serhiyi Bozhko", "Christopher Ian Hill", "Greg Asher"], "keywords": ["aircraft power systems", "eigenvalues and eigenfunctions", "electric vehicles", "modal analysis", "permanent magnet generators", "synchronous generators", "time-domain analysis", "EPS", "MEA", "PMSG", "PMSG-based DC electrical power system", "dc-distribution electrical power system", "eigenvalues sensitivity", "modal analysis", "more electric aircraft", "permanent magnet synchronous generator", "stability behavior", "time domain simulations", "Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions", "Inductance", "Mathematical model", "Power system stability", "Resistance", "Sensitivity", "Stability analysis", "DC power distribution", "Modal analysis", "eigenvalue sensitivity", "modal analysis", "more electric aircraft", "more electric aircraft (MEA)", "stability", ""], "arnumber": "7098423"}
