Electrification is the most promising solution to enable a more sustainable and environmentally friendly transportation system. Electrified transportation vision includes utilizing more electrical energy to power traction and nontraction loads in the vehicle. In electrified powertrain applications, the efficiency of the electrical path, and the power and energy density of the components play important roles to improve the electric range of the vehicle to run the engine close to its peak efficiency point and to maintain lower energy consumption with less emissions. In general, the electrified powertrain architecture, design and control of the powertrain components, and software development are coupled to facilitate an efficient, high-performance, and reliable powertrain. In this paper, enabling technologies and solutions for the electrified transportation are discussed in terms of power electronics, electric machines, electrified powertrain architectures, energy storage systems (ESSs), and controls and software.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "4", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "17", "date_publication": "Mon May 25 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "inspec": "15343126", "date": "June 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Jul 10 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "4 - 17"}, "authors": ["Berker Bilgin", "Pierre Magne", "Pawel Malysz", "Yinye Yang", "Vera Pantelic", "Matthias Preindl", "Alexandre Korobkine", "Weisheng Jiang", "Mark Lawford", "Ali Emadi"], "keywords": ["control engineering computing", "electric machines", "hybrid electric vehicles", "machine control", "power transmission (mechanical)", "software engineering", "traction", "traffic engineering computing", "electric machines", "electric range improvement", "electrical energy utilization", "electrical path efficiency", "electrified powertrain architectures", "electrified transportation", "energy density", "energy storage systems", "environmentally friendly transportation system", "less greenhouse gas emissions", "lower energy consumption", "lower fuel consumption", "nontraction loads", "peak efficiency point", "power density", "power electronics", "power traction", "powertrain component control", "software development", "sustainable transportation system", "Fuels", "Mechanical power transmission", "Rotors", "Torque", "Traction motors", "Vehicles", "Electric machines", "electric vehicles", "electric vehicles (EVs)", "electrified powertrains", "energy storage", "energy storage systems", "energy storage systems (ESSs)", "hybrid EVs (HEVs)", "hybrid electric vehicles", "plug-in HEVs (PHEVs)", "plug-in hybrid electric vehicles", "power electronics", "transportation electrification", "vehicle control software", ""], "arnumber": "7112507"}
