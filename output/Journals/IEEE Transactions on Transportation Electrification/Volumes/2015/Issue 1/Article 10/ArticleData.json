The designed system accommodates the wide-range input voltage (450 V-220 VDC) and output voltage (16 V-6 VDC). An LLC halfbridge topology is adopted as the primary side of the dc/dc converter. For the secondary side, a novel synchronous rectification control (SRC) strategy is developed to switch metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs) through accurately tracking the target switching moments. Experimental results were carried out to charge the on-board 12-V battery and validate the proposed control algorithm. The maximum system efficiency is 93.2%. System power loss is also itemized.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "106", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "114", "date_publication": "Wed May 06 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "inspec": "15343123", "date": "June 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Jul 10 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "106 - 114"}, "authors": ["Chen Duan", "Hua Bai", "Wei Guo", "Zhong Nie"], "keywords": ["DC-DC power convertors", "MOSFET", "battery powered vehicles", "bridge circuits", "network topology", "rectification", "secondary cells", "DC-DC converter", "LLC half bridge topology", "MOSFET", "SRC strategy", "electric vehicle", "metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor", "on-board battery charging", "power 2.5 kW", "synchronous rectification control", "target switching moment tracking", "Batteries", "Bridge circuits", "Electric vehicles", "MOSFET", "Switches", "Zero voltage switching", "DC/DC Converter", "DC/DC converter", "Electric Vehicle", "LLC Resonant", "LLC resonant", "MOSFET", "Synchronous Rectifier", "electric vehicle", "synchronous rectifier", ""], "arnumber": "7102753"}
