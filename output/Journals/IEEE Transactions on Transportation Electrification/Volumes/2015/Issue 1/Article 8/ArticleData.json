Mathematical models of EV charging service demands, solar power outputs, operational costs of energy storage, and fuel cell systems are developed. A stochastic dynamic programming method is proposed to take different temporal variations of energy production and consumption into account, and determine optimal dispatch schedule and contracted power from utility, such that the operation cost of the charging station and its impact to the distribution grid are reduced. Tests are conducted for a comparison with deterministic dynamic programming methods using perfect prediction of intermittent renewable outputs and charging demands. Numerical results indicate that the stochastic approach proposed can provide efficient dispatch schedules and an informed decision on the contracted power capacity to support transportation electrification.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "86", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "93", "date_publication": "Wed May 06 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "inspec": "15343124", "date": "June 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Jul 10 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "86 - 93"}, "authors": ["Yung-Tang Liao", "Chan-Nan Lu"], "keywords": ["demand side management", "distributed power generation", "dynamic programming", "fuel cell vehicles", "power generation dispatch", "power generation economics", "power generation scheduling", "power grids", "solar power", "stochastic programming", "sustainable development", "EV charging service demand", "EV charging station energy resource dispatch", "contracted power capacity", "controllable resource", "distribution grid", "economic dispatch", "electric vehicle", "energy consumption", "energy production", "energy storage", "energy storage system", "fuel cell systems", "intermittent renewable output prediction", "operational cost prediction", "optimal dispatch schedule determination", "photovoltaic panel", "solar power output", "stochastic dynamic programming method", "sustainable mobility", "temporal variations", "transportation electrification", "Batteries", "Charging stations", "Dynamic programming", "Fuel cells", "Fuels", "Stochastic processes", "Transportation", "Charging station", "distributed energy resources", "distributed energy resources (DERs)", "electric vehicle", "electric vehicle (EV)", "stochastic dynamic programming", "stochastic dynamic programming (SDP)", "transportation electrification", ""], "arnumber": "7102755"}
