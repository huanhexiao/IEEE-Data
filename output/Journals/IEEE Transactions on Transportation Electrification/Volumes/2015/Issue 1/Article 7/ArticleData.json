Power intensive assets are likely to compete for available generation capacity, and thermal loads are expected to greatly exceed current heat removal capacity. To address this challenge, a total-ship zonal distribution model that includes electric power, chilled water (CW), and refrigerated air (RA) systems is developed. Classifier-guided sampling (CGS), a population-based optimization algorithm for solving problems with discrete variables and discontinuous responses, is used to identify high-performance configurations with respect to fuel consumption. This modeling approach supports early-stage design decisions and performance analyses of notional systems in response to changing operating modes and damage scenarios. A set of configurations that enhance survivability is identified. Results of a comparison study demonstrate that CGS improves the rate of convergence toward superior solutions, on average, when compared to genetic algorithms (GAs).", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "77", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "85", "date_publication": "Mon May 04 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "inspec": "15343118", "date": "June 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Jul 10 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "77 - 85"}, "authors": ["Peter B.
