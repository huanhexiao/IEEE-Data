Malfunctions in sensors could lead to a deterioration in battery performance. This paper proposed an effective health monitoring scheme using a median expectation-based diagnosis approach (MEDA). MEDA calculates the median of a possible set of values, rather than taking their weighted average as in the case of a standard expected mean operator. Furthermore, a smoother was developed to capture important patterns in the estimation. The resulting filter was first derived using an one-dimensional (1-D) system example, where the iterative convergence of median-based proposed filter was proved. Performance evaluations were subsequently conducted by analyzing real-time measurements collected from Li-ion battery cells used in hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) and plug-in HEVs (PHEV) duty cycles. Results showed that the proposed filter was more effective and less sensitive to small sample size and curves with outliers.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "94", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "105", "date_publication": "Mon May 04 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "inspec": "15343117", "date": "June 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Jul 10 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "94 - 105"}, "authors": ["Haris M.
