It is demonstrated through an architecture comparison that the voltage rating of the power inverter semiconductors will be higher for inductor-capacitor-capacitor (LCC) than for a more conventional Series-Parallel (S-P) tuning. Higher voltage at the source inverter dc bus facilitates better utilization of the semiconductors, hence lower cost. Electrical and thermal stress factors of the passive components are explored, in particular the compensating capacitors and coupling coils. Experimental results are presented for a prototype, precommercial, 10 kW wireless charger designed for heavy duty (HD) vehicle application. Results are in good agreement with theory and validate a design that minimizes component stress.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "26", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "39", "date_publication": "Thu May 07 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "inspec": "15343125", "date": "June 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Jul 10 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "1", "pages": "26 - 39"}, "authors": ["John M.
