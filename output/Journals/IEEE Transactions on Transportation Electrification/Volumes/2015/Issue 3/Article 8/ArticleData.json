In most motor drives for transportation, it is set as a constant value at some specific torque or speed. The variable switching frequency pulse width modulation (VSFPWM), which changes the switching frequency cycle to cycle based on a current ripple prediction method, has been proposed in previous literatures and realized in resistance- inductance (RL) loads and induction motors (IMs). It proves effective to increase the overall system efficiency and improve electromagnetic interference (EMI) performance. However, the previous current ripple prediction method encounters difficulty in dealing with more complex motors, e.g., interior permanent magnet (IPM) motors, which is widely used in electric vehicles. As a result, the benefits of VSFPWM cannot be fully utilized for IPM drive systems. This paper proposed a new current ripple prediction method using the d-q transformation instead of the conventional Thevenin equivalent circuit method and successfully implemented VSFPWM to IPM drives. Simulation and experiments on a 400-V IPM test bench validated the effectiveness of the method, which will vary the switching frequency from cycle to cycle in order to 1) restrain the three-phase current ripples; 2) increase the overall system efficiency; and 3) enhance the system electromagnetic capability (EMC).", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "277", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "286", "date_publication": "Tue Jun 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "inspec": "15539886", "date": "Oct. 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Oct 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "277 - 286"}, "authors": ["Fei Yang", "Allan Ray Taylor", "Hua Bai", "Bing Cheng", "Ahmad Arshan Khan"], "keywords": ["DC-AC power convertors", "electromagnetic interference", "invertors", "permanent magnet motors", "synchronous motor drives", "transforms", "EMI performance", "IPM motors", "Thevenin equivalent circuit method", "VSFPWM", "current ripple prediction method", "current ripple prediction method encounters", "d-q transformation", "dc-ac inverter", "electric vehicles", "electromagnetic interference performance", "induction motors", "interior permanent magnet synchronous motor drive systems", "resistance-inductance loads", "switching frequency cycle to cycle", "switching frequency pulse width modulation", "three-phase current ripples", "voltage 400 V", "Inductance", "Induction motors", "Inverters", "Permanent magnet motors", "Prediction methods", "Reluctance motors", "Switching frequency", "Motor drive system", "motor drive system", "permanent magnet synchronous motor", "permanent magnet synchronous motor,", "switching loss", "variable switching frequency PWM", "variable switching frequency pulse width modulation (VSFPWM)", "voltage-source inverter", ""], "arnumber": "7124504"}
