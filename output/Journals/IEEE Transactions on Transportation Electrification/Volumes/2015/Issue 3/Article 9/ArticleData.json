This MPC is equipped with state estimators and is implemented as a recursive linear quadratic regulator for practical deployments in hybrid vehicle applications. Additionally, a learning mechanism is developed to dynamically adapt to the inductance profile of the machine and update the MPC and Kalman filter parameters. The introduced control scheme can cope with noise as well as uncertainties within the machine nonlinear inductance surface. The introduced system will benefit from a fixed switching frequency and will offer low current ripples by calculating the optimal duty cycles using the SRM model. Finally, simulations and experimental results are provided to evaluate the proposed method.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "287", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "297", "date_publication": "Wed Aug 12 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "inspec": "15539890", "date": "Oct. 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Oct 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "287 - 297"}, "authors": ["Xin Li", "Pourya Shamsi"], "keywords": ["Kalman filters", "electric current control", "learning (artificial intelligence)", "machine control", "power engineering computing", "predictive control", "reluctance motors", "Kalman filter parameters", "MPC scheme", "SRM", "current control", "fixed switching frequency", "hybrid vehicle applications", "inductance surface estimation", "inductance surface learning", "learning mechanism", "optimal duty cycles", "practical deployments", "recursive linear quadratic regulator", "stochastic model predictive control scheme", "switched reluctance motors", "Adaptation models", "Couplings", "Delays", "Estimation", "Inductance", "Reluctance motors", "Current control", "Kalman filter", "LQR", "MPC", "SRM", "current control", "delay compensation", "inductance estimation", "inductance surface learning", "least quadratic regulator (LQR)", "model predictive control (MPC)", "motor drive", "predictive control", "recursive least squares", "switched reluctance", "switched reluctance motors (SRMs)", ""], "arnumber": "7192631"}
