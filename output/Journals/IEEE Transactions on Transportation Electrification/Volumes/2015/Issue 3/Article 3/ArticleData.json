This paper presents the design of a supervisory energy management strategy that optimally addresses this issue. In this work, a multiobjective optimization problem is formulated to optimize the power split in order to prolong the battery lifetime and to reduce the HESS power losses. In this HESS energy management problem, a detailed dc-dc converter model is considered to include both the conduction losses and the switching losses. The optimization problem is numerically solved for various drive cycle data sets using dynamic programming (DP). Trained using the DP results, an effective and intelligent online implementation of the optimal power split is realized based on neural networks (NNs). The proposed online intelligent energy management controller is applied to a midsize electric vehicles (EV). A rule-based control strategy is also implemented in this work for comparison with the proposed energy management strategy. The proposed online energy management controller effectively splits the load demand and achieves excellent result of the energy efficiency. It is also estimated that the proposed online energy management controller can extend the battery life by over 60%, which greatly outperforms the rule-based control strategy.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "223", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "231", "date_publication": "Tue Aug 04 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "inspec": "15539887", "date": "Oct. 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Oct 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "223 - 231", "issn": "2332-7782"}, "authors": ["Junyi Shen", "Alireza Khaligh"], "keywords": ["DC-DC power convertors", "battery management systems", "battery powered vehicles", "dynamic programming", "energy conservation", "energy management systems", "hybrid electric vehicles", "neural nets", "power control", "supercapacitors", "HESS energy management problem", "HESS power losses", "battery lifetime", "battery/ultracapacitor hybrid energy storage system", "conduction losses", "dc-dc converter model", "dynamic programming", "intelligent energy management controller", "intelligent online implementation", "midsize electric vehicles", "multiobjective optimization problem", "neural networks", "online energy management controller", "optimal power split", "power split performance", "real-time implementation", "rule-based control strategy", "supervisory energy management control strategy", "switching losses", "Artificial neural networks", "Batteries", "DC-DC power converters", "Energy management", "Optimization", "Transportation", "Electric vehicle", "Electric vehicle (EV)", "hybrid energy storage system", "hybrid energy storage system (HESS)", "multi-objective optimization", "multiobjective optimization", "neural networks", "neural networks (NNs)", "ultra-capacitor", "ultracapacitor (UC)", ""], "arnumber": "7177105"}
