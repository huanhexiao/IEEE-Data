This paper presents the design and comparative evaluation for an interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) with distributed winding and concentrated winding, induction motor (IM), and switched reluctance motor (SRM) for an electric vehicle (EV) or hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) application. A fast finite element analysis (FEA) modeling approach is addressed for IM design. To account for highly nonlinear motor parameters and achieve high motor efficiency, optimal current trajectories are obtained by extensive mapping for IPMSMs and IM. Optimal turn-ON and turn-OFF angles with current chopping control and angular position control are found for SRM. Additional comparison including noise vibration and harshness (NVH) is also highlighted. Simulation and analytical results show that each motor topology demonstrates its own unique characteristic for EVs/HEVs. Each motor's highest efficiency region is located at different torque-speed regions for the criteria defined. Stator geometry, pole/slot combination, and control strategy differentiate NVH performance.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "245", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "254", "date_publication": "Wed Aug 19 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "inspec": "15552443", "date": "Oct. 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Oct 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "245 - 254"}, "authors": ["Zhi Yang", "Fei Shang", "Ian P.
