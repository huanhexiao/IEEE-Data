This converter is similar to an LLC-type resonant converter with an extra inductor and capacitor in the secondary side. Soft-switching can be ensured in all switches without additional snubber or clamp circuitry. Because of soft-switching in all switches, very high-frequency operation is possible; thus, the size of the magnetics and the filter capacitors can be made small. To reduce the size and cost of the converter, a CLLC-type resonant network is derived from the original CLLLC-type resonant network. First, in this paper, an equivalent model for the bidirectional converter is derived for the steady-state analysis. Then, the design methodology is presented for the CLLLC-type resonant converter. Design of this converter includes determining the transformer turns ratio, design of the magnetizing inductance based on zero-voltage switching condition, design of the resonant inductances and capacitances. Then, the CLLCtype resonant network is derived from the CLLLC-type resonant network. To validate the design procedure, a 3.5-kW converter was designed following the guidelines in the proposed methodology. A prototype was built and tested in the laboratory. Experimental results verified the design procedure presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "232", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "244", "date_publication": "Wed Sep 02 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "inspec": "15552446", "date": "Oct. 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Oct 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "232 - 244"}, "authors": ["Zaka Ullah Zahid", "Zakariya M.
