They require a wide speed range and high efficiency along with high power density and mechanical robustness. Traction motors and their drives are also expected to deliver superior performance throughout the lifetime of the vehicle. Considering the extreme loading conditions, the motors should be designed for very strict thermal requirements. Therefore, all electromagnetic, mechanical, and thermal variables must be thoroughly addressed in motor design. In this review paper, a summary of current structural and thermal simulation methods applicable for traction motors is presented. Prominent design issues along with appropriate analysis methodologies are explained. In addition, briefcase studies of electromagnetic, structural, and thermal analysis performed at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) US LLC are highlighted. A detailed list of references and an analysis road map are also provided to aid practicing engineers and researchers involved in electric machine design.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "255", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "265", "date_publication": "Thu Sep 03 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "inspec": "15552447", "date": "Oct. 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Oct 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "255 - 265"}, "authors": ["Srivatsan Ramarathnam", "Abdul Kalam Mohammed", "Berker Bilgin", "Anand Sathyan", "Hossein Dadkhah", "Ali Emadi"], "keywords": ["automotive electrics", "electric machine analysis computing", "hybrid electric vehicles", "power transmission (mechanical)", "thermal analysis", "traction motors", "Fiat Chrysler automobiles", "current structural", "electric machine design", "high power density", "hybrid electric powertrains", "mechanical robustness", "stringent operational requirements", "thermal analysis", "thermal simulation methods", "traction motors", "wide speed range", "Electromagnetics", "Magnetomechanical effects", "Rotors", "Shafts", "Stress", "Torque", "Traction motors", "Computer aided engineering (CAE)", "Computer-aided engineering (CAE)", "fatigue analysis", "finite element analysis (FEA)", "spin analysis", "structural analysis", "thermal analysis", "traction motors", ""], "arnumber": "7239624"}
