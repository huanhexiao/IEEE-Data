Coordinated EV charging can be further classified into two types, namely time coordinated charging (TCC) and power coordinated charging (PCC). Scheduling of EV charging is the vital component in both types of coordinated EV charging methods. Generally, priority criteria such as battery state of charge (SOC) and slack time are used for scheduling EV charging. In this paper, the impact of different priority criteria on the chargeability of EVs and charging fairness is studied for both types of coordinated EV charging methods. The overall performance of the coordinated EV charging methods employing various combinations of different priority criteria is evaluated using data-driven simulations. In addition, this paper evaluates the need for using weighted priority criteria for scheduling EV charging along with appropriate weights required for different cases.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "200", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "210", "date_publication": "Wed Aug 05 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "inspec": "15539888", "date": "Oct. 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Oct 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "200 - 210", "issn": "2332-7782"}, "authors": ["Kandasamy Nandha Kumar", "Balakrishnan Sivaneasan", "Ping Lam So"], "keywords": ["automotive electrics", "battery powered vehicles", "scheduling", "PCC", "SOC", "TCC", "battery state of charge", "coordinated EV charging methods", "data-driven simulations", "electric vehicle charge scheduling", "electric vehicles integration", "power coordinated charging", "priority criteria impact", "time coordinated charging", "Batteries", "Dynamic scheduling", "Load modeling", "Power systems", "System-on-chip", "Vehicles", "Chargeability", "Electric vehicle", "chargeability", "coordinated charging", "electric vehicle (EV)", "fairness", "priority criteria", "scheduling", ""], "arnumber": "7180397"}
