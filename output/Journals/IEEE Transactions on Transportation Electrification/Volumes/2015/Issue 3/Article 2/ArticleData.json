Not only does this strategy try to minimize fuel consumption while maintaining the state of charge of the battery within reasonable bounds, it also seeks to minimize wear of the battery and extend its life. This paper focuses on understanding the optimal control solution offered by Pontryagin's minimum principle (PMP) in this context. Simulation-based results are presented and analyzed, which show that the control algorithm is able to reduce battery wear by decreasing battery operating severity factor with minimal fuel economy penalty. The benefit of this strategy is especially evident when ambient and driving conditions are especially severe.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "211", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "222", "date_publication": "Fri Aug 21 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "inspec": "15552444", "date": "Oct. 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Oct 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "211 - 222", "issn": "2332-7782"}, "authors": ["Li Tang", "Giorgio Rizzoni", "Simona Onori"], "keywords": ["automotive electrics", "battery powered vehicles", "energy consumption", "energy management systems", "fuel economy", "hybrid electric vehicles", "HEV including battery life optimization", "Pontryagin minimum principle", "energy management strategy", "fuel consumption minimization", "minimal fuel economy penalty", "Aging", "Batteries", "Electric machines", "Engines", "Fuels", "System-on-chip", "Vehicles", "Battery Aging", "Battery aging", "Energy Management", "HEVs", "Optimal Control", "PMP", "Pontryagin???s minimum principle (PMP)", "energy management", "hybrid electric vehicle (HEVs)", "optimal control", ""], "arnumber": "7217846"}
