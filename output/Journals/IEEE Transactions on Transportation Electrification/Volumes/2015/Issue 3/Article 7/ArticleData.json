Only a limited set of parameters, such as weight, size, or speed, is often relevant at a system level, but accurately determining those parameters requires performing a time-consuming detailed design of the electrical machine. This conflicts with a top down system design approach, where initially many different system topologies need to be considered. Hence, there is a need for a consistent and detailed description of the dependency of the interface parameters on machine properties. This paper proposes a method to obtain detailed design trends of electrical machines with a very high level of detail, based on large-scale application of multiobjective optimization using finite element models. The method is demonstrated by quantifying the power density of surface-mounted permanent magnet (SPM) machines versus rotor surface speed, power level, and cooling approach. It is found that power density strongly depends on cooling approach, followed by rotor surface speed, but barely on power level. Ultimately, this paper can be used both as an example when performing a similar design study and as a reference on detailed high-level and low-level machine design trends.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "266", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "276", "date_publication": "Wed Sep 02 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "inspec": "15552445", "date": "Oct. 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Oct 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "3", "pages": "266 - 276"}, "authors": ["Martin van der Geest", "Henk Polinder", "Jan Abraham Ferreira", "Markus Christmann"], "keywords": ["finite element analysis", "optimisation", "permanent magnet machines", "synchronous machines", "SPM machines", "cooling approach", "electrical machines", "finite element models", "high-speed permanent magnet synchronous machines", "low-level machine design", "multiobjective optimization", "power density limits", "power level", "rotor surface speed", "surface-mounted permanent magnet machines", "Cooling", "Density measurement", "Market research", "Optimization", "Power system measurements", "Rotors", "Windings", "AC machines", "design trends", "high-speed machines", "more electric aircraft", "particle swarm optimization", "permanent magnet machines", "power density", ""], "arnumber": "7236923"}
