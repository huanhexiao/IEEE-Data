An ever-increasing number of PEVs have been radically changing the traditional view of the power industry, transportation industry, and business world. Research on grid integration of PEVs typically addresses topics at the vehicle-grid boundary, such as peak load impacts and charging control. While researchers around the world are making significant advances in these areas, there is little work addressing the coupled effects of PEV charging with the mobility-focused, transportation ecosystem to meet the dynamic needs of a changing society. In this paper, we propose a systematic co-modeling and simulation framework to investigate the impacts of PEV charging facilities on the electric distribution system and transportation system. Moreover, we explore the possibilities to improve the system's stability and the efficiency of the integrated electrified transportation systems by taking advantage of a variety of charging control strategies. The case studies focus on the PEV charging facilities in a relatively small portion of electric power system and transportation system, especially in metropolitan areas. However, the ideas contained here will apply to more generally coupled, and large-scale electrified transportation systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "178", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "187", "date_publication": "Wed Jun 10 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "inspec": "15677596", "date": "Aug. 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Aug 14 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "2", "pages": "178 - 187", "issn": "2332-7782"}, "authors": ["Jingwei Xiong", "Kuilin Zhang", "Yi Guo", "Wencong Su"], "keywords": ["ecology", "electric vehicles", "electricity supply industry", "environmental economics", "power distribution control", "power distribution economics", "power grids", "power system stability", "PEV charging facilities impact", "business world", "charging control strategies", "economical friendly characteristics", "environmentally friendly characteristics", "grid integration", "integrated electric distribution system", "integrated electrified transportation system efficiency", "integrated electrified transportation system stability", "plug-in electric vehicles", "power industry", "transportation ecosystem", "transportation industry", "vehicle-grid boundary", "Charging stations", "Electric vehicles", "Power engineering", "Power grids", "Power system dynamics", "Power systems", "Power Engineering", "Power Systems", "Power engineering", "Transportation", "power systems", "transportation", ""], "arnumber": "7121000"}
