The goal of the Hijacker is to eliminate the torque ripple encountered by a sudden switch from the open to closed loop operation, providing a smooth transition between the two control mechanisms and reliable operation over the motor's entire speed range without the use, or added cost of speed/position sensors. Implementation of the Hijacker exhibits extreme simplicity, so as not to add heavy computational loads on the processor. The algorithm, along with its development and justification, is then validated through both simulation and the test bench using a 1.4-kW/4500 rpm brushless dc motor.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "126", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "137", "date_publication": "Tue May 05 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "inspec": "15677593", "date": "Aug. 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Aug 14 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "2", "pages": "126 - 137", "issn": "2332-7782"}, "authors": ["Philip Mike Johnson", "Kevin Bai", "Xiaofeng Ding"], "keywords": ["DC motor drives", "angular velocity control", "automobiles", "brushless DC motors", "closed loop systems", "electric potential", "open loop systems", "reliability", "sensorless machine control", "Hijacker algorithm", "back-EMF-based sensorless control", "brushless DC motor", "closed loop operation", "electrified automobile system", "motor drive full speed range", "open-loop control strategy", "operation reliability", "position sensor", "power 1.4 kW", "smooth transition", "speed sensor", "torque ripple elimination", "Brushless DC motors", "Inverters", "Motor drives", "Permanent magnet motors", "Sensorless control", "Voltage measurement", "Brushless DC", "inverter", "motor drive system", "permanent magnet motor", "sensorless control", ""], "arnumber": "7101863"}
