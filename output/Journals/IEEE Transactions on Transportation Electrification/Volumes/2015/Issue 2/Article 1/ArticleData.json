The superior characteristics enable considerable loss, size, and weight reduction of power converters in the powertrain of hybrid/electric vehicles. However, the fast switching capability of SiC devices renders them more vulnerable to parasitic inductances in the circuit. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the impact of interconnection inductances to overvoltage during turn-OFF transient of SiC devices. To understand the switching behavior of the SiC devices, the ringing and overshoots of the voltage caused by the device capacitance and interconnection inductances are considered. Parametric studies are conducted to compare the influences of printed circuit board (PCB) and packaging inductances on the peak turn-OFF overvoltage under various operating conditions. A prototype half-bridge buck converter with SiC MOSFETs is constructed for the experiments. Experimental results are shown to validate the simulation results.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "118", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "125", "date_publication": "Wed May 06 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "inspec": "15677595", "date": "Aug. 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Aug 14 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "2", "pages": "118 - 125", "issn": "2332-7782"}, "authors": ["Jukkrit Noppakunkajorn", "Di Han", "Bulent Sarlioglu"], "keywords": ["MOSFET", "electronics packaging", "printed circuit interconnections", "silicon compounds", "wide band gap semiconductors", "MOSFET", "SiC", "half-bridge buck converter", "high-speed PCB analysis", "hybrid-electric vehicle", "interconnection inductance influence", "packaging inductance", "parasitic inductance", "power converter", "power switching device", "powertrain", "printed circuit board", "turn-off overvoltage", "Hybrid electric vehicles", "Inductance", "MOSFET", "Silicon carbide", "Transient analysis", "Voltage control", "Hybrid/electric vehicle", "Hybrid/electric vehicle,", "parasitic inductance", "parasitic inductance,", "silicon (Si) carbide (SiC)", "silicon carbide", "voltage overshoot", ""], "arnumber": "7102774"}
