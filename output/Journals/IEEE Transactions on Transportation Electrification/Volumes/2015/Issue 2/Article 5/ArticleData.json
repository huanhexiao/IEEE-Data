However, to consider the vehicle-to-home (V2H) and home-tovehicle (H2V) capabilities, new energy control strategy has to be developed to avoid new peaks consumption. This paper presents a novel controller based on fuzzy logic, which integrates an objective state-of-charge (SoC) for V2H application. The V2H capability is used when the PHEV is connected to the home to help the grid to meet the household loads during peak period. The SoC objective is the minimum SoC that the PHEV has to have when the driver connects the PHEV to the home. The proposed controller is applied on fourth different scenario.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "168", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "177", "date_publication": "Mon May 04 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "inspec": "15677592", "date": "Aug. 2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Aug 14 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issue": "2", "pages": "168 - 177"}, "authors": ["Florence Berthold", "Alexandre Ravey", "Benjamin Blunier", "David Bouquain", "Sheldon Williamson", "Abdellatif Miraoui"], "keywords": ["fuzzy control", "hybrid electric vehicles", "intelligent control", "power grids", "PHEV", "SoC", "energy control strategy", "fuzzy logic", "home-to-vehicle capability", "peaks consumption avoidance", "plug-in hybrid electric vehicle", "smart control strategy", "state-of-charge", "transportation electrification", "vehicle-to-home functionality", "Batteries", "Electric vehicles", "Fuzzy logic", "Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles", "Power generation", "Control strategy", "electric vehicles", "electric vehicles (EVs)", "plug-in hybrid electric vehicle", "plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV)", "power generation scheduling", "vehicle power systems", ""], "arnumber": "7098408"}
