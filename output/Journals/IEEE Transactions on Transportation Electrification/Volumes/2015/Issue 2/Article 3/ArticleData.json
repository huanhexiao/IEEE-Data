Hence, in order to determine the torque and power capabilities of an electric machine under realtime operating conditions, dynamic knowledge of internal temperatures is required and needs to be estimated in a computationally efficient manner. In this paper, we present a technique for developing computationally efficient thermal models for electric machines that can be used for real-time thermal observers and electrified vehicle powertrain-level simulation and optimization. The technique is based on simulating eigenmodes of the thermal dynamics as determined by 3-D finite-element analysis (FEA). The order of the FE model is then dramatically reduced. The full-order system is decomposed into two parts by using the orthogonality property of the thermal eigenmodes, and only eigenmodes, which are significantly excited, are included in the dynamic model; other eigenmodes are treated as static modes. A large 3-D FEA model can be thus reduced to a small reduced-order model without the necessity of calculating all the eigenmodes. Furthermore, the process of selecting the significantly excited eigenmodes is automatic based on a proposed normalized \u201cextent of excitation\u201d calculation. By using the proposed techniques, the computation time of the model can be dramatically reduced compared with the full-order model while maintaining sufficient accuracy.
