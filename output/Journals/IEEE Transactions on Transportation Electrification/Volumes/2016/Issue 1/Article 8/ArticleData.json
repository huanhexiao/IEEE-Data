In transportation system, the input filters are small and not much damped to save weight/volume. In order to know when the system becomes unstable with those small LC filters and high cut-off frequency, the conventional analysis based on an average model may not be accurate enough. In this paper, a new discrete-time model is proposed to investigate the behavior of the studied system and to take into account the switching effect. A stabilizer is also proposed to increase the maximum power. This system is composed of a dc-dc boost converter with a modified control, an LC filter, and a constant power load. Experimental results confirm the validity of the proposed tool.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "86", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "95", "date_publication": "Tue Jan 19 00:00:00 EST 2016", "inspec": "15903292", "date": "March 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 29 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "86 - 95"}, "authors": ["Louis-Marie Saublet", "Roghayeh Gavagsaz-Ghoachani", "Jean-Philippe Martin", "Babak Nahid-Mobarakeh", "Serge Pierfederici"], "keywords": ["DC-DC power convertors", "LC circuits", "bifurcation", "control system analysis", "discrete time systems", "electric vehicles", "nonlinear control systems", "power filters", "stability", "DC power system stabilization", "DC-DC boost converter", "LC filter", "bifurcation analysis", "discrete time model", "electrified transportation systems", "input filters", "maximum power", "switching effect", "Bifurcation", "Cutoff frequency", "Load modeling", "Stability analysis", "Switches", "Switching frequency", "Transportation", "Command and control systems", "constant power load", "modeling", "nonlinear control systems", "robustness", "stability analysis", ""], "arnumber": "7386692"}
