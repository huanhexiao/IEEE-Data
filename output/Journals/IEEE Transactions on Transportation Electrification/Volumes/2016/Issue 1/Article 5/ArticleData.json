After analyzing the equivalent circuit of the bidirectional ac-dc converter, we first derive the mathematical model under RC mode by using state-space averaging method. Then, we originally formulate the Tagaki-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model to represent its nonlinear dynamics. By combining the merits ofT-S fuzzy technique with sliding-mode control (SMC) method, we develop a T-S fuzzy SMC (TSFSMC)-based constant-voltage (CV) charging control to guarantee both high performance and robust stability. Moreover, comparing to conventional methods, we declare that TSFSMC does not need the input channel to be identical and can simultaneously achieve dual goals of electric braking and RC without any additional devices. We have implemented a control prototype to analyze and confirm the validity of TSFSMC. Results show that high charging performance and significant efficiency improvement are obtained.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "52", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "65", "date_publication": "Thu Feb 25 00:00:00 EST 2016", "inspec": "15903296", "date": "March 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 29 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "52 - 65"}, "authors": ["Xizheng Zhang", "Yaonan Wang", "Guorong Liu", "Xiaofang Yuan"], "keywords": ["AC-DC power convertors", "DC motor drives", "braking", "brushless DC motors", "electric vehicles", "equivalent circuits", "fuzzy control", "robust control", "variable structure systems", "voltage control", "BLDC motor drives", "RC mode", "T-S fuzzy SMC-based constant-voltage charging control", "T-S fuzzy sliding-mode approach", "Tagaki-Sugeno fuzzy model", "advanced electric vehicle", "bidirectional AC-DC converter", "brushless DC motor drives", "electric braking", "equivalent circuit analysis", "mathematical model", "robust regenerative charging control scheme", "sliding-mode control method", "state-space averaging method", "Batteries", "Equivalent circuits", "Integrated circuit modeling", "Mathematical model", "Permanent magnet motors", "Topology", "Vehicles", "Advanced electric vehicle (EV)", "Regenerative charging", "T-S fuzzy sliding-mode control", "Tagaki???Sugeno fuzzy sliding-mode control (TSFSMC)", "advanced electric vehicle", "bidirectional AC-DC converter", "bidirectional ac???dc converter", "brushless DC (BLDC) motor", "brushless dc (BLDC) motor", "regenerative charging (RC)", ""], "arnumber": "7419896"}
