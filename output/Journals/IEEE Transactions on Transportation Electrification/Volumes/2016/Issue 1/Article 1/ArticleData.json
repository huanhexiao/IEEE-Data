However, many special design challenges exist for HSEMs. This paper aims to summarize and discuss major challenges and design considerations for HSEMs. Solutions to overcome these challenges are also offered in this paper. Four major loss components of HSEMs are discussed and the methods to reduce each loss component are further explained. Bearing options for HSEMs are also compared. In addition, the rotor dynamics and structural challenges are discussed in detail, followed by some design suggestions and considerations. Thermal and cooling challenges are presented as an overview. At the end, the challenges for power electronics circuitry are also demonstrated and are followed by some proposed solutions. Thus, this paper offers a guideline for proper technique selection and the design of HSEMs and associated accessories.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "2", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "13", "date_publication": "Fri Jan 29 00:00:00 EST 2016", "inspec": "15903295", "date": "March 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 29 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "2 - 13"}, "authors": ["Silong Li", "Yingjie Li", "Wooyoung Choi", "Bulent Sarlioglu"], "keywords": ["electric machines", "rotors", "HSEM", "automotive industry", "cooling challenges", "design considerations", "high-speed electric machines", "power electronics circuitry", "rotor dynamics", "structural challenges", "thermal challenges", "Conductors", "Copper", "Resistance", "Rotors", "Windings", "Wires", "Bearing", "challenges", "considerations", "cooling", "high speed electric machines", "high-speed electric machines (HSEMs)", "loss", "power electronics", "rotor dynamics", "structural integrity", "thermal", ""], "arnumber": "7395385"}
