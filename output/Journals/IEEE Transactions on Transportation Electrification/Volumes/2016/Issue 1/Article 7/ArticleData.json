This paper provides an analysis on designing D-WPT systems. Design parameters such as number of Tx coils, separation between Tx, operating frequency, and load characteristics are analyzed with respect to efficiency for the D-WPT system with segmented transmitter array. A double-spiral repeater (DSR) is proposed for improving efficiency, enhancing transfer distance, and misalignment tolerance. Experimental results of the proposed topology with DSRs show efficiencies of 81% and 60% at normalized transfer distances (normalized to geometric mean of Tx and Rx sizes) of 0.74 and 2.2, respectively. The proposed topology can be effectively used to alleviate efficiency deterioration against transfer distance and misalignment in D-WPT systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "76", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "85", "date_publication": "Thu Dec 17 00:00:00 EST 2015", "inspec": "15903289", "date": "March 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 29 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "76 - 85"}, "authors": ["J.
