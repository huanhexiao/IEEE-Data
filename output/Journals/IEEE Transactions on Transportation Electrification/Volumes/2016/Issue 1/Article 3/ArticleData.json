Inverter and machine losses, and perceived sound quality of high-frequency acoustic noise are investigated by finite element calculations, experimental testing, and subjective noise assessment. Additionally, stator current harmonics, airgap flux density harmonics, and force density harmonics are compared for space vector modulation (SVM) and discontinuous pulsewidth modulation through finite element modeling. The main conclusion is that, primarily in the field weakening region, significant energy savings can be achieved (up to 17% decrease in total inverter losses with a switching frequency of 10 kHz). This is obtained without deterioration of perceived sound quality by the use of discontinuous pulsewidth modulation with switching frequency randomization. Furthermore, randomization of the switching frequency does not improve the perceived sound quality of the acoustic noise when using SVM. However, for discontinuous pulsewidth modulation, improvements in perceived sound quality when randomizing the switching frequency are observed, primarily below base speed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "24", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "35", "date_publication": "Fri Jan 01 00:00:00 EST 2016", "inspec": "15903290", "date": "March 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 29 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "24 - 35"}, "authors": ["Andreas Andersson", "David Lennstr\u00f6m", "Arne Nyk\u00e4nen"], "keywords": ["PWM invertors", "acoustic noise", "air gaps", "finite element analysis", "harmonics", "magnetic flux", "permanent magnet motors", "signal denoising", "stators", "synchronous motor drives", "acoustic noise", "airgap flux density harmonics", "automotive applications", "discontinuous pulsewidth modulation", "electric drive efficiency", "energy savings", "experimental testing", "field weakening region", "finite element calculations", "finite element modeling", "force density harmonics", "high-frequency acoustic noise", "inverter losses", "inverter modulation strategy", "machine losses", "perceived sound quality", "rear axle electrical drive", "stator current harmonics", "subjective noise assessment", "switching frequency randomization", "Force", "Harmonic analysis", "Inverters", "Modulation", "Stators", "Switching frequency", "Transportation", "Energy efficiency", "modulation techniques", "noise assessment", "permanent magnet synchronous machine", "permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM)", ""], "arnumber": "7370814"}
