In order to achieve three-phase balance of traction power grid, a modular multilevel converter (MMC)-based railway traction power conditioner (RTPC) is studied, which is characterized by modular multilevel cascaded structure. The RTPC consists of four H-Bridge links and output filter inductors, which can be connected to 27.5-kV traction feeders in co-phase supply system directly. This conditioner can be used for different kinds of traction system, especially suited to Scott traction system. According to the analysis of equivalent electrical model and power balance of RTPC, a hierarchical control strategy is put forward aiming to balance the submodule capacitor voltages, which ensures the safety and stability of system. Finally, the structure and its control strategy are verified by the simulation and experiment effectively.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "96", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "109", "date_publication": "Wed Jan 06 00:00:00 EST 2016", "inspec": "15903291", "date": "March 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 29 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "96 - 109"}, "authors": ["Fujun Ma", "Qianming Xu", "Zhixing He", "Chunming Tu", "Zhikang Shuai", "An Luo", "Yong Li"], "keywords": ["hierarchical systems", "power convertors", "power grids", "power supply quality", "railway electrification", "traction power supplies", "voltage control", "H-bridge links", "MMC RTPC", "Scott traction system", "co-phase supply system", "equivalent electrical model analysis", "hierarchical control strategy", "high-power electrified railway", "high-speed railway system", "modular multilevel cascaded structure", "modular multilevel converter", "output filter inductors", "power balance analysis", "power quality", "railway traction power conditioner", "submodule capacitor voltages", "system stability", "traction feeders", "traction power grid", "voltage 27.5 kV", "Capacitors", "Harmonic analysis", "Power harmonic filters", "Power quality", "Rail transportation", "Hierarchical control", "Railway power conditioners (RPC)", "hierarchical control", "multilevel converter", "multilevel converter,", "power quality", "railway power conditioners (RPC)", "voltage balance", ""], "arnumber": "7373676"}
