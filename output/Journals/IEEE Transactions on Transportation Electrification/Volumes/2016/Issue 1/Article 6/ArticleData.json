With their onboard batteries, EVs also present an opportunity to serve as a demand response tool in supporting future smart grid where there is usually high penetration level of renewable energy (RE) sources. In this study, a novel dynamic demand control (DDC) has been developed to coordinate the charging and discharging of EVs according to the frequency deviation signal to deal with intermittent RE generation. Furthermore, in our work, customers' requirements and satisfaction are strictly guaranteed through the introduction of a new term called Urgency Index. The merits of this scheme are its simplicity, efficiency, robustness, and readiness for practical applications. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated by computer simulations of a power system with high penetration level of wind energy.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "66", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "75", "date_publication": "Tue Jan 19 00:00:00 EST 2016", "inspec": "15903293", "date": "March 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 29 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "66 - 75"}, "authors": ["Hoang N.
