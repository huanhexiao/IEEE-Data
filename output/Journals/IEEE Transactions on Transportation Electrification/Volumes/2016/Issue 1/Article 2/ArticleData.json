The proposed strategy aims to improve efficiency of the powertrain with this particular dc/ac converter. For this purpose, it is proposed to adapt in real time the dc-bus voltage to the mechanical speed of the machine. The strategy is realized by implementing a control method based on the flatness properties of the system. These particular properties allow mastering all the state variable or input variable trajectories, which is interesting in the present case where the dc-bus voltage trajectory has to be well known. In order to increase the control dynamic, a one-loop flatness-based control is implemented. The structure thus allows increasing the controller bandwidth that helps in reducing the size of the dc-bus capacitors. Simulations and experiments on a 500-W powertrain are carried out to show that the proposed control strategy is effective and provides an efficiency improvement.", "journal_title": "IEEE Transactions on Transportation Electrification", "firstpage": "14", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "23", "date_publication": "Tue Jan 19 00:00:00 EST 2016", "inspec": "15903294", "date": "March 2016", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 29 00:00:00 EDT 2016", "issue": "1", "pages": "14 - 23"}, "authors": ["Alexandre Battiston", "El-Hadj Miliani", "Serge Pierfederici", "Farid Meibody-Tabar"], "keywords": ["electric vehicles", "invertors", "permanent magnet machines", "power transmission (mechanical)", "synchronous machines", "dc-ac converter", "dc-bus capacitors", "dc-bus voltage trajectory", "electric vehicle", "one-loop flatness-based control", "power 500 W", "powertrain", "quasi-z-source inverter-fed permanent-magnet synchronous machine", "Automotive applications", "Electric vehicles", "Inverters", "Mechanical power transmission", "Trajectory", "Voltage control", "Efficiency", "Electric vehicle", "Flatness-based control", "PMSM", "efficiency", "electric vehicle", "flatness-based control", "permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM)", "quasi-Z-source inverter", "quasi-Z-source inverter (QZSI)", "stability", ""], "arnumber": "7386699"}
