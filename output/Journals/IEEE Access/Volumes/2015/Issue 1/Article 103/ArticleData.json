Classified as a non-deterministic polynomial-time hard problem, routing in WMHNs requires sophisticated methods. As a benefit of observing numerous variables in parallel, quantum computing offers a promising range of algorithms for complexity reduction by exploiting the principle of quantum parallelism (QP), while achieving the optimum full-search-based performance. In fact, the so-called non-dominated quantum optimization (NDQO) algorithm has been proposed for addressing the multiobjective routing problem with the goal of achieving a near-optimal performance, while imposing a complexity of the order of O(N) and O(N\u221aN) in the best and worst case scenarios, respectively. However, as the number of nodes in the WMHN increases, the total number of routes increases exponentially, making its employment infeasible despite the complexity reduction offered. Therefore, we propose a novel optimal quantum-assisted algorithm, namely, the non-dominated quantum iterative optimization (NDQIO) algorithm, which exploits the synergy between the hardware and the QP for the sake of achieving a further complexity reduction, which is on the order of O(\u221aN) and O(N\u221aN) in the best and worst case scenarios, respectively. In addition, we provide simulation results for demonstrating that our NDQIO algorithm achieves an average complexity reduction of almost an order of magnitude compared with the near-optimal NDQO algorithm, while having the same order of power consumption.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1704", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1728", "date_publication": "Tue Sep 15 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15511108", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Oct 13 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1704 - 1728", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Dimitrios Alanis", "Panagiotis Botsinis", "Zunaira Babar", "Soon Xin Ng", "Lajos Hanzo"], "keywords": ["iterative methods", "optimisation", "quantum computing", "telecommunication network routing", "wireless mesh networks", "NDQIO algorithm", "NDQO algorithm", "WMHN", "average complexity reduction", "multiobjective routing problem", "nondeterministic polynomial-time hard problem", "nondominated quantum iterative optimization algorithm", "optimal quantum-assisted algorithm", "optimum full-search-based performance", "quantum computing", "quantum parallelism", "wireless multihop networks", "Pareto optimization", "Quantum computing", "Routing protocols", "Spread spectrum communication", "Wireless communication", "BBHT-QSA", "DHA", "NDQO", "Pareto Optimality", "Pareto optimality", "Quantum Computing", "WMHNs", "quantum computing", ""], "arnumber": "7268791"}
