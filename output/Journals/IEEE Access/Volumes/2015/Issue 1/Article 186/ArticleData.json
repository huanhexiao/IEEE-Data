To reduce the burden of sensors, compression can be utilized. Since the traditional chaos-based schemes are not directly applicable for WSNs, we present a hybrid security solution. The hybrid security consists of 8-bit integer chaotic block encryption and a chaos-based message authentication codes. It aims to promote the security and performance of data gathering. In this paper, a hybrid security and compressive sensing-based scheme for multimedia sensor data gathering is presented. It has light security mechanism and thus decreases the complexity and energy consumption of system. Performance analysis about security and compression is carried out. The results show that our scheme is more applicable for WSNs multimedia data gathering from security and compression efficiency.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "718", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "724", "date_publication": "Mon Jun 01 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15193789", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 09 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "718 - 724", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Jin Qi", "Xiaoxuan Hu", "Yun Ma", "Yanfei Sun"], "keywords": ["compressed sensing", "cryptography", "multimedia systems", "wireless sensor networks", "chaos based message authentication codes", "compressive sensing", "cryptographic techniques", "data security", "integer chaotic block encryption", "multimedia sensor data gathering", "sensor data gathering scheme", "wireless sensor network", "Authentication", "Block codes", "Chaotic communication", "Encryption", "Energy consumption", "Energy efficiency", "Multimedia communication", "Network security", "Wireless sensor networks", "Chaotic block encryption", "WSNS", "WSNs", "chaotic block encryption", "compressive sensing", "multimedia data gathering", ""], "arnumber": "7115016"}
