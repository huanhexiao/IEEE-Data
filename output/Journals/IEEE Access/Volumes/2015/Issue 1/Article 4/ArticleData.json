However, when the system misidentifies native cells as threats, it results in an auto-immune response. The auto-antibodies generated during this phenomenon may be identified through the indirect immunofluorescence test. An important constituent process of this test is the automated identification of antigen patterns in the cell images, which is the focus of this research. We perform a detailed literature review and present a framework to automate the identification of antigen patterns. The efficacy of the framework, demonstrated on the MIVIA ICPR 2012 HEp-2 Cell Contest and SNP HEp-2 Cell datasets, suggests that the algorithm is comparable with the state-of-the-art approaches.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "3102", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "3113", "date_publication": "Thu Nov 26 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15707869", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 21 00:00:00 EST 2016", "pages": "3102 - 3113", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Ishan Nigam", "Shreyasi Agrawal", "Richa Singh", "Mayank Vatsa"], "keywords": ["biomedical optical imaging", "cellular biophysics", "fluorescence", "image classification", "medical image processing", "SNP HEp-2 Cell datasets", "antigen patterns", "autoantibodies", "autoimmune response", "automated identification", "cell image classification", "homosapiens", "immune system", "immunofluorescence test", "Accuracy", "Cell image classification", "Diseases", "Feature extraction", "Immune system", "Support vector machines", "Testing", "Biomedical imaging", "HEp-2 cells", "anti-nuclear antibody testing", "indirect immunofluorescence test", "laws texture measure", ""], "arnumber": "7339422"}
