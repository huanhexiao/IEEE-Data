Along with advanced features of smart grid, the reliability of smart grid communication system emerges to be a critical issue, since millions of smart devices are interconnected through communication networks throughout critical power facilities, which has an immediate and direct impact on the reliability of the entire power infrastructure. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of reliability issues posted by the smart grid with a focus on communications in support of neighborhood area networks (NAN). Specifically, we focus on network architecture, reliability requirements and challenges of both communication networks and systems, secure countermeasures, and case studies in smart grid NAN. We aim to provide a deep understanding of reliability challenges and effective solutions toward reliability issues in smart grid NAN.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2352", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2365", "date_publication": "Thu Nov 19 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15623181", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 01 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2352 - 2365", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Shengjie Xu", "Yi Qian", "Rose Qingyang Hu"], "keywords": ["power system interconnection", "power system reliability", "power system security", "smart power grids", "telecommunication network reliability", "telecommunication security", "NAN", "communication interconnected network", "demand response", "distributed communication intelligence", "power system reliability", "renewable energy resources", "smart grid communication system", "smart grid neighborhood area network", "Communication networks", "Computer network reliability", "IEEE 802.11 Standard", "Power system reliability", "Reliability", "Smart grids", "Wide area networks", "Neighborhood Area Network", "Reliability", "Smart Grid", "Smart grid", "neighborhood area network", "reliability", ""], "arnumber": "7332240"}
