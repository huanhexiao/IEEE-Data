In order to overcome this threat, organizations apply enterprise content-aware data leakage prevention (DLP) solutions to monitor and control data access and usage. However, this paper argues that current solutions are not able to reliably protect information assets. The analyses of data breaches reported in 2014 reveal a significant number of data leakage incidents that are not within the focus of the DLP solutions. Furthermore, these analyses indicate that the classification of the provided data breach records is not qualified for detailed investigations. Therefore, advanced criteria for characterizing data leakage incidents are introduced, and the reported records are extended. The resulting analyses illustrate that DLP and information leakage prevention (ILP) demand various information security (IS) measures to be established in order to reduce the risk of technologically based data breaches. Furthermore, the effectiveness of DLP and information leakage prevention (ILP) measures is significantly influenced by non-technological aspects, such as the human factor. Therefore, this paper presents a concept for establishing DLP and ILP within the scope of IS.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2554", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2565", "date_publication": "Mon Dec 07 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15638759", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Dec 17 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2554 - 2565", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Barbara Hauer"], "keywords": ["information retrieval", "security of data", "ILP", "control data access", "data breach", "data leakage prevention", "enterprise content-aware DLP solution", "enterprise content-aware data leakage prevention solution", "information leakage prevention", "information security", "Credit cards", "Electronic mail", "Information security", "Media", "Monitoring", "Organizations", "Standards", "Security", "data leakage prevention", "data security", "information exposure", "information leakage prevention", "information security", "security", ""], "arnumber": "7348633"}
