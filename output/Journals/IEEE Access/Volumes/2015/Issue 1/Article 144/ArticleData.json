We explicitly consider the pilot contamination effect during the channel estimation in the SEE maximization problem, which aims to optimize the power allocation, the number of activated antennas, and the pilot assignment. To tackle the SEE maximization problem, we transform it into a subtractive form, which can be solved more efficiently. In particular, we develop an iterative algorithm to solve the transformed problem where optimization of power allocation and number of antennas is performed, and then pilot assignment optimization is conducted sequentially in each iteration. To tackle the first sub-problem, we employ a successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to attain a solvable convex optimization problem. Moreover, we propose a novel iterative low-complexity algorithm based on the Hungarian method to solve the pilot assignment sub-problem. We also describe how the proposed solution approach can be useful to address the sum rate (SR) maximization problem. In addition to the algorithmic developments, we characterize the optimal structure of both SEE and SR maximization problems. The numerical studies are conducted to illustrate the convergence of the proposed algorithms, impacts of different parameters on the SR and SEE, and significant performance gains of the proposed solution compared the conventional design.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1272", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1287", "date_publication": "Tue Aug 04 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15352004", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Aug 14 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1272 - 1287", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Tri Minh Nguyen", "Vu Nguyen Ha", "Long Bao Le"], "keywords": ["MIMO communication", "approximation theory", "channel estimation", "convex programming", "energy conservation", "iterative methods", "multi-access systems", "telecommunication power management", "wireless channels", "Hungarian method", "SCA technique", "SEE maximization", "SR maximization problem", "channel estimation", "convex optimization problem", "iterative algorithm", "multiuser multicell massive MIMO network", "multiuser multicell massive multiinput multioutput network", "pilot contamination effect", "power allocation optimization", "resource allocation optimization", "successive convex approximation", "sum rate maximization problem", "system energy efficiency maximization", "Antenna measurements", "Channel estimation", "Contamination", "Energy efficiency", "MIMO", "Power allocation", "Resource management", "Energy efficiency", "massive MIMO", "multi-cell", "pilot assignment", "pilot contamination", "power allocation", ""], "arnumber": "7177037"}
