As a consequence, equivalent exposures to radiation from mobile phones result in different doses to specific tissues in children compared with adults. Higher doses are likely to have more severe implications in the young. A young child's skull is not only smaller and thinner than an adult's, but also has dielectric characteristics closer to those of soft tissues, probably due to a higher water content. The young skull better matches the electromagnetic characteristics of the skin and brain. As a result, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations confirm field penetration and higher specific absorption rate (SAR) in deeper structures in the young brain. If the peak spatial SAR (psSAR) is modeled in the entire head, as current testing standards recommend, the results for adults and children are equivalent. Our anatomically based evaluations rely on FDTD simulations of different tissues within the brain and confirm that the psSAR in a child's brain is higher than in an adult's brain.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2425", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2430", "date_publication": "Mon Nov 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15638758", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Dec 09 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2425 - 2430", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Claudio Enrique Fern\u00e1ndez-Rodr\u00edguez", "Alvaro Augusto Almeida De Salles", "Devra Lee Davis"], "keywords": ["brain", "dosimetry", "finite difference time-domain analysis", "skin", "smart phones", "FDTD simulation", "brain absorption dosimetric simulation", "brain electromagnetic characteristics", "finite difference time-domain simulation", "immune system", "mobile phone radiation", "nervous system myelination", "peak spatial SAR", "psSAR", "skin electromagnetic characteristics", "soft tissue", "specific absorption rate", "water content", "Absorption", "Bones", "Brain models", "Finite difference methods", "Phantoms", "Time-domain analysis", "Dosimetry", "Finite-Difference Time-Domain imulation", "Mobile phone certification", "Specific Absorption Rate", "Specific absorption rate", "dosimetry", "finite-difference time-domain simulation", "mobile phone certification", ""], "arnumber": "7335557"}
