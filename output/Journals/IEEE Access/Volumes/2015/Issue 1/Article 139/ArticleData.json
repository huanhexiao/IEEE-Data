Unfortunately, these power generation patterns are mostly intermittent in nature and distributed over the electrical grid, which creates challenging problems in the reliability of the smart grid. Thus, the smart grid has a strong requisite for an efficient communication infrastructure to facilitate estimating the DER states. In contrast to the traditional methods of centralized state estimation (SE), we propose a distributed approach to microgrid SE based on the concatenated coding structure. In this framework, the DER state is treated as a dynamic outer code, and the recursive systematic convolutional (RSC) code is seen as a concatenated inner code for protection and redundancy in the system states. Furthermore, in order to properly monitor the intermittent energy source from any place, this paper proposes a distributed SE method. Particularly, the outputs of the local SE are treated as measurements, which are fed into the master fusion station. At the end, the global SE can be obtained by combining local SEs with corresponding weighting factors. The weighting factors can be calculated by inspiring the covariance intersection method. The simulation results show that the proposed method is able to estimate the system state properly.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1340", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1349", "date_publication": "Tue Aug 11 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15406005", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 26 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1340 - 1349", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Md Masud Rana", "Li Li", "Steven Su"], "keywords": ["renewable energy sources", "smart power grids", "DER", "RSC coded smart grid communications", "SE", "carbon-free energy sources", "centralized state estimation", "distributed state estimation", "electrical grid", "environment-friendly electricity generation", "recursive systematic convolutional", "renewable distributed energy resources", "Distributed processing", "Energy management", "Recursive estimation", "Resource management", "Smart grids", "State estimation", "Distributed energy resource", "Kalman filter", "recursive systematic convolutional code", "smart grid", "state estimation", ""], "arnumber": "7185341"}
