However, due to the diffusive nature of photon propagation in biological tissues, FMT suffers from a low spatial resolution, which limits its capability of resolving the distribution of fluorescent biomarkers. In this paper, we investigate the effect of functional and structural a priori information on the accuracy of FMT reconstruction by a hybrid FMT and X-ray computed tomography imaging system. The results from numerical simulation and phantom experiments suggest that the fluorescence targets embedded in heterogeneous medium can be localized when structural a priori information is utilized to constrain the reconstruction process. In addition, both the functional and structural a priori information are essential for the recovery of fluorophore concentration.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "64", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "72", "date_publication": "Wed Feb 11 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14945591", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "64 - 72", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Xin Liu", "Zhuangzhi Yan", "Hongbing Lu"], "keywords": ["biomedical optical imaging", "computerised tomography", "fluorescence", "image reconstruction", "image resolution", "medical image processing", "optical tomography", "phantoms", "FMT reconstruction", "X-ray computed tomography imaging system", "biological tissues", "fluorescence molecular tomography", "fluorescent biomarkers", "fluorophore concentration", "functional a priori information", "in vivo small animal imaging", "performance evaluation", "phantom", "photon propagation", "spatial resolution", "structural a priori information", "Animals", "Biomedical imaging", "Fluorescence", "Image reconstruction", "In vivo", "Molecular imaging", "Optical imaging", "Reconstruction algorithms", "Tomography", "Image reconstruction", "optical imaging", "reconstruction algorithms", ""], "arnumber": "7039231"}
