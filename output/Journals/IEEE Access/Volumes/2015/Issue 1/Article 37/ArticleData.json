Two electrically small, near-field resonant parasitic (NFRP) antennas are first designed. Both are based on a coax-fed dipole antenna. An electric dipole response is obtained by combining it with a tunable Egyptian axe dipole (EAD) NFRP element. A magnetic dipole response is obtained by spatially loading the driven dipole with tunable, extruded capacitively loaded loop (CLL) NFRP elements. The driven dipole and the EAD and CLL NFRP elements are combined together and retuned to achieve a broadside radiating Huygens source antenna. Two different designs, one with two CLL elements and one with four, are obtained, and their performance characteristics are compared.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2644", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2651", "date_publication": "Fri Dec 04 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15656091", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 22 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2644 - 2651", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Richard W.
