In this paper, we study the energy-efficient context-aware resource allocation problem, which falls into the category of mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) and is NP-hard. To provide a tractable solution, the MINLP problem is decoupled and reformulated as a one-to-one matching problem under two-sided preferences, which are modeled as the maximum energy efficiency that can be achieved under the expected matching. An iterative algorithm is developed to establish preference profiles by employing nonlinear fractional programming and Lagrange dual decomposition. Then, we propose an energy-efficient matching algorithm based on the Gale-Shapley algorithm, and provide the detailed discussion and analysis of stability, optimality, implementation issues, and algorithmic complexity. The proposed matching algorithm is also extended to scenarios with preference, indifference, and incomplete preference lists by introducing some tie-breaking and preference deletion rules. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves significant performance and satisfaction gains compared with the conventional algorithms.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1849", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1860", "date_publication": "Tue Sep 15 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15511124", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 15 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1849 - 1860", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Zhenyu Zhou", "Mianxiong Dong", "Kaoru Ota", "Zheng Chang"], "keywords": ["cellular radio", "computational complexity", "energy conservation", "integer programming", "iterative methods", "nonlinear programming", "resource allocation", "telecommunication power management", "telecommunication traffic", "Gale-Shapley algorithm", "Lagrange dual decomposition", "MINLP problem", "NP-hard problem", "algorithmic complexity", "context-aware matching", "context-aware resource allocation problem", "energy efficiency", "energy price", "iterative algorithm", "mixed integer nonlinear programming", "mobile data traffic", "nonlinear fractional programming", "ultra-dense small cells", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Cache storage", "Context awareness", "Data processing", "Energy efficiency", "Energy storage", "Iterative methods", "Mobile communication", "Resource management", "Telecommunication traffic", "Energy-efficient", "caching", "context-aware", "energy-efficient", "small cell", "ultra-dense", ""], "arnumber": "7268835"}
