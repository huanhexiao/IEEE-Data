We carry out single-carrier single-antenna software defined radio (SDR) experiments with a wireless communications link over which we transmit and receive packets with the embedded fingerprinting. We analyze these experimental results and find they match well with theoretical predictions. This paper demonstrates that the method of superimposed fingerprints can deliver high probability of authentication without additional bandwidth and with minimal impact on bit-error rate in SDR systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "81", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "88", "date_publication": "Fri Jan 30 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14945590", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 26 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "81 - 88", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Gunjan Verma", "Paul Yu", "Brian M.
