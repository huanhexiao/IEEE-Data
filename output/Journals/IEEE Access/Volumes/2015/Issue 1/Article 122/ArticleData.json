Rather than device-to-device communications, group communications in the form of broadcasting and multicasting incur efficient message deliveries among resource-constrained sensor nodes in the IoT-enabled WSNs. Secure and efficient key management is in many cases used to protect the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of multicast messages. This paper develops two group key establishment protocols for secure multicast communications among the resource-constrained devices in IoT. Major deployment conditions and requirements of each protocol are described in terms of the specific IoT application scenarios. Furthermore, the applicability of the two protocols is analyzed and justified by a comprehensive analysis of the performance, scalability, and security of the protocols proposed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1503", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1511", "date_publication": "Fri Aug 28 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15443733", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Sep 15 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1503 - 1511", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Pawani Porambage", "An Braeken", "Corinna Schmitt", "Andrei Gurtov", "Mika Ylianttila", "Burkhard Stiller"], "keywords": ["Internet of Things", "multicast communication", "protocols", "telecommunication security", "wireless sensor networks", "Internet of Things", "IoT application", "WSN", "broadcasting", "device-to-device communication", "group communication", "group key establishment protocol", "multicast message", "resource-constrained sensor node", "secure multicast communication", "wireless sensor network", "Digital signatures", "Multicast communication", "Protocols", "Public key", "Scalability", "Wireless sensor networks", "Internet of Things", "Wireless Sensor Networks", "group key establishment", "multicast", "security", "wireless sensor networks", ""], "arnumber": "7229244"}
