This paper presents a random neural network (RNN) and a genetic algorithm-based hybrid cognitive engine (CE) architecture to reduce the ICI and achieve the coverage and capacity optimization in a long-term evolution uplink system. The embedded CE within eNodeB learns from the local environment about the effect of ICI on the reliability of communications. Consequently, the CE dynamically selects the optimal transmission power for serving users based on an experienced signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and an ICI on a scheduled RB in the subsequent transmission time intervals. The CE also suggests acceptable transmit power to users operating on the same scheduled RB in adjacent cells through the X2 interface (a communication interface between eNodeBs). The RNN features help the CE to acquire long-term learning, fast decision making, and less computational complexity, which are essential for the development and practical deployment of any real-time cognitive communication system. In six different test cases, the simulation results have shown improvements up to 87% in long-term learning and a quick convergence of the RNN as compared with artificial neural network models. Moreover, the gains of 7% in average cell capacity and 118% in system coverage have been achieved as compared with a fractional power control method.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1963", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1979", "date_publication": "Mon Oct 19 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15543322", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Oct 28 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1963 - 1979", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Ahsan Adeel", "Hadi Larijani", "Ali Ahmadinia"], "keywords": ["Long Term Evolution", "OFDM modulation", "decision making", "genetic algorithms", "neural nets", "power control", "radiofrequency interference", "telecommunication control", "LTE uplink system", "capacity optimization", "communication interface", "computational complexity", "eNodeB", "fast decision making", "genetic algorithm-based hybrid cognitive engine architecture", "inter-cell interference", "inter-cell-interference coordination", "local environment", "long-term evolution uplink system", "long-term learning", "optimal transmission power", "orthogonal frequency division multiple access systems", "power control strategy", "random neural network", "real-time cognitive communication system", "resource blocks", "resource management", "signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio", "transmission time intervals", "transmit power", "Artificial neural networks", "Genetic algorithms", "Intercell interference", "Neural networks", "OFDM", "Resource management", "Artificial neural network", "Intercell interference", "artificial neural network", "coverage and capacity optimization", "fractional power control", "genetic algorithm", "inter-cell interference", "power control", "random neural network", ""], "arnumber": "7300382"}
