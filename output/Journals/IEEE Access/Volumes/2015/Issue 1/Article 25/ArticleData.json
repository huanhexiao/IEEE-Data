The proposed scheme allows the on board unit (OBU) to reserve service channels (SCHs) on the control channel (CCH) during almost the whole synchronous interval and supports simultaneous transmissions on different SCHs. It enhances the performance of VANETs and decreases the CCH congestion. Moreover, we use RSU to record the rendezvous information and broadcast it to the OBUs. This method avoids the multi-channel hidden terminal problem. An analytical model is developed to evaluate the aggregate throughput on SCHs. This model considers the following factors: non-safety message transmission probability in each synchronous interval, average size of the non-safety message, and the number of OBUs. Furthermore, the requirement of obtaining the maximum throughput is computed. Simulation results are provided to validate the analytical model and to demonstrate the improvement in throughput. The results indicate that the proposed scheme can provide higher aggregate throughput than that of the vehicular enhanced multi-channel MAC and IEEE 1609.4, and better performance in CCH congestion control especially under high network load conditions.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2794", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2802", "date_publication": "Thu Dec 17 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15656097", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Dec 31 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2794 - 2802", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Xiaohuan Li", "Bin-Jie Hu", "Hongbin Chen", "Guillaume Andrieux", "Yide Wang", "Zong-Heng Wei"], "keywords": ["access protocols", "telecommunication channels", "vehicular ad hoc networks", "Grant CGZHZD1102", "Guangxi province", "RSU-coordinated synchronous multichannel MAC", "energy saving system", "vehicle safety monitoring", "vehicular ad hoc networks", "Aggregates", "Analytical models", "Media Access Protocol", "Safety", "Throughput", "Vehicles", "Vehicular ad hoc networks", "Multi-channel MAC", "RSU-coordinated", "VANETs", "multi-channel MAC", "multi-channel hidden terminal", "rendezvous", ""], "arnumber": "7359109"}
