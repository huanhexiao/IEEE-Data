Network function virtualization (NFV) is proposed to address these issues by implementing network functions as pure software on commodity and general hardware. NFV allows flexible provisioning, deployment, and centralized management of virtual network functions. Integrated with SDN, the software-defined NFV architecture further offers agile traffic steering and joint optimization of network functions and resources. This architecture benefits a wide range of applications (e.g., service chaining) and is becoming the dominant form of NFV. In this survey, we present a thorough investigation of the development of NFV under the software-defined NFV architecture, with an emphasis on service chaining as its application. We first introduce the software-defined NFV architecture as the state of the art of NFV and present relationships between NFV and SDN. Then, we provide a historic view of the involvement from middlebox to NFV. Finally, we introduce significant challenges and relevant solutions of NFV, and discuss its future research directions by different application domains.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2542", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2553", "date_publication": "Wed Dec 09 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15638885", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Dec 17 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2542 - 2553", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Yong Li", "Min Chen"], "keywords": ["optimisation", "software architecture", "software defined networking", "SDN", "agile traffic steering", "network function virtualization", "network ossification", "software-defined NFV architecture", "software-defined network function virtualization", "virtual network function", "Computer architecture", "Control systems", "Hardware", "Home appliances", "Servers", "Software", "Virtualization", "Software-defined networks", "middlebox", "network function virtualization", "network virtualization", "service chain", ""], "arnumber": "7350211"}
