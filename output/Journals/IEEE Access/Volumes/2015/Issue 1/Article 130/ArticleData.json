The previous research mainly focuses on exploring wireless signal fingerprints for this purpose, and several shortcomings need to be addressed first before real-world usage, e.g., demanding a large number of access points or labor-intensive site survey. In this paper, through a systematic empirical study, we first gain in-depth understandings of Bluetooth characteristics, i.e., the impact of various factors, such as distance, orientation, and obstacles on the Bluetooth received signal strength indicator (RSSI). Then, by mining from historical data, a novel localization model is built to describe the relationship between the RSSI and the device location. On this basis, we present an energy-efficient indoor localization scheme that leverages user motions to iteratively shrink the search space to locate the target device. An Motion-assisted Device Tracking Algorithm has been prototyped and evaluated in several real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments show that our algorithm is efficient in terms of localization accuracy, searching time and energy consumption.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1450", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1461", "date_publication": "Thu Jun 04 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15422953", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 04 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1450 - 1461", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Yu Gu", "Fuji Ren"], "keywords": ["Bluetooth", "RSSI", "radio equipment", "ubiquitous computing", "Bluetooth characteristics", "Bluetooth received signal strength indicator", "RSSI", "device location", "energy efficient indoor localization", "motion assisted device tracking algorithm", "pervasive applications", "smart handheld devices", "wireless signal fingerprints", "Bluetooth", "Data mining", "Energy efficiency", "Hand held devices", "Indoor communication", "Mobile communication", "Pervasive computing", "Bluetooth", "Data Mining", "Energy efficiency", "IoT", "bluetooth", "data mining", "indoor Localization", "indoor localization", ""], "arnumber": "7118131"}
