Traffic sensor data gathered by large amounts of sensors show some new features, such as massiveness, continuity, streaming, and spatio-temporality. ITS applications utilizing traffic sensor data can be divided into three main types: 1) offline processing of historical data; 2) online processing of streaming data; and 3) hybrid processing of both. Current research tends to solve these problems in separate solutions, such as stream computing and batch processing. In this paper, we propose a hybrid processing approach and present corresponding system implementation for both streaming and historical traffic sensor data, which combines spatio-temporal data partitioning, pipelined parallel processing, and stream computing techniques to support hybrid processing of traffic sensor data in real-time. Three types of real-world applications are explained in detail to show the usability and generality of our approach and system. Our experiments show that the system can achieve better performance than a popular open-source streaming system called Storm.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2341", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2351", "date_publication": "Thu Nov 12 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15623183", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 01 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2341 - 2351", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Zhuofeng Zhao", "Weilong Ding", "Jianwu Wang", "Yanbo Han"], "keywords": ["intelligent transportation systems", "pipeline processing", "sensor fusion", "spatiotemporal phenomena", "traffic engineering computing", "ITS", "Internet of Things", "hybrid processing system", "intelligent transportation system", "offline historical data processing", "online streaming data processing", "pipelined parallel processing", "spatiotemporal data partitioning", "stream computing technique", "traffic sensor data", "Computational modeling", "Data models", "Data processing", "Distributed databases", "Real-time systems", "Storms", "System implementation", "Traffic sensor data", "real-time processing", "spatio-temporal data object", "stream computing", ""], "arnumber": "7328238"}
