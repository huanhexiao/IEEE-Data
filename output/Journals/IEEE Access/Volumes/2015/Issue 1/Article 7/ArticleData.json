Localization techniques became popular with the global positioning system for outdoor applications, and in recent years, this has been followed by Wi-Fi localization for indoor applications. More recently, localization science and technology has progressed into in-body medical applications. Localization technologies have their own specific challenges depending on the application and environment, which are left for scientists and engineers to overcome. This paper presents the relation among different elements of the Smart World and corresponding localization technologies, classifies localization applications enabling smart devices and environments into logical categories, describes the complexity of the technologies used for localization, and introduces some of the open challenges for localization in the Smart World.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "3058", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "3067", "date_publication": "Thu Dec 17 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15707863", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 12 00:00:00 EST 2016", "pages": "3058 - 3067", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Kaveh Pahlavan", "Prashant Krishnamurthy", "Yishuang Geng"], "keywords": ["Global Positioning System", "wireless LAN", "Global Positioning System", "Wi-Fi localization", "in-body medical applications", "indoor applications", "localization challenge", "outdoor applications", "smart device", "smart environment", "smart world emergence", "Complexity theory", "Feature extraction", "Global Positioning System", "Sensors", "Signal processing algorithms", "Smart cities", "Time measurement", "Inertial navigation", "Navigation", "Position measurement", "Radio navigation", "Radio propagation", "Smart homes", ""], "arnumber": "7355289"}
