However, the lack of association between the age and the weight of an individual makes it challenging to model these variations for automatic face recognition. In this paper, we propose a regularizer-based approach to learn weight invariant facial representations using two different deep learning architectures, namely, sparse-stacked denoising autoencoders and deep Boltzmann machines. We incorporate a body-weight aware regularization parameter in the loss function of these architectures to help learn weight-aware features. The experiments performed on the extended WIT database show that the introduction of weight aware regularization improves the identification accuracy of the architectures both with and without dropout.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "3010", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "3018", "date_publication": "Tue Dec 22 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15707865", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 07 00:00:00 EST 2016", "pages": "3010 - 3018", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Shruti Nagpal", "Maneet Singh", "Richa Singh", "Mayank Vatsa"], "keywords": ["face recognition", "feature extraction", "learning (artificial intelligence)", "automatic face recognition", "body weight variations", "body-weight aware regularization parameter", "deep Boltzmann machines", "deep learning architectures", "extended WIT database", "learn weight invariant facial representations", "person aging process", "regularized deep learning", "regularizer-based approach", "sparse-stacked denoising autoencoders", "weight-aware feature learning", "Deep learning", "Face recognition", "Machine learning", "Noise reduction", "Training data", "Face recognition", "biometrics", "body-weight variations", "facial aging", ""], "arnumber": "7361971"}
