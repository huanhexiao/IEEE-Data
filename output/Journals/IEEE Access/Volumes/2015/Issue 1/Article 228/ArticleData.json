Traditionally, communication performance tests have focused on the RF performance of the tested devices, e.g., smart phones, pads, laptops, and so on. In particular, the focus has shifted from conducted (i.e., cabled) measurements to more realistic over-the-air (OTA) characterization of the RF performance of these devices in transmit or receive mode. For example, the receiver performance of 2G and 3G wireless devices can be measured in terms of the total isotropic sensitivity (TIS) that depends on the antenna and the receiver parts of a wireless device. These measurements can be performed in a reverberation chamber setup. However, standard TIS measurements can be time-consuming and do not reflect the actual performance gains of multiple-input multiple-output antenna systems operating over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing channels, such as those encountered in 4G long-term evolution (LTE) systems. Therefore, in order to meet both time and cost efficiency requirements, we propose here a new method to determine the TIS, as well as the diversity performance, of an LTE device based on throughput measurements. The proposed method shows that the TIS of an LTE device is characterized much faster directly from OTA throughput measurements than from standard TIS measurements and with excellent accuracy.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "131", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "145", "date_publication": "Mon Mar 09 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15012170", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 24 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "131 - 145", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Ahmed Hussain", "Per-Simon Kildal", "Andr\u00e9s Alayon Glazunov"], "keywords": ["4G mobile communication", "Long Term Evolution", "MIMO communication", "OFDM modulation", "diversity reception", "reverberation chambers", "2G wireless devices", "3G wireless devices", "4G LTE systems", "4G long-term evolution systems", "LTE device", "OTA characterization", "RF products", "TIS measurements", "communication performance tests", "communications protocols", "conducted measurements", "diversity performance", "multiple-input multiple-output antenna systems", "orthogonal frequency division multiplexing channels", "over-the-air characterization", "reverberation chamber setup", "throughput measurements", "total isotropic sensitivity", "Antenna measurements", "Long Term Evolution", "MIMO", "OFDM", "Performance evaluation", "Radio frequency", "Receivers", "Reverberation chambers", "Sensitivity analysis", "Wireless communication", "Wireless sensor networks", "LTE", "MIM", "MIMO", "OFDM", "OTA", "TIS", "reverberation chamber", "throughput", ""], "arnumber": "7056526"}
