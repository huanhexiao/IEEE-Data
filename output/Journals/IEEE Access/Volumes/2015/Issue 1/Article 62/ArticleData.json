In this context, variability models are used to specify which configurable features are supported and which constraints among the features must be satisfied to guarantee the validity of the derived products. As the market demand grows and evolves, variability models become increasingly complex. In such entangled models, it is hard to identify which features are absolutely essential or dispensable because they are required to be included or excluded from all the possible products, respectively. This paper exposes the limitations of existing approaches to automatically detect those features and provides an algorithm that efficiently performs such detection.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2333", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2340", "date_publication": "Mon Nov 09 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15607718", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Nov 24 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2333 - 2340", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Hector Perez-Morago", "Ruben Heradio", "David Fernandez-Amoros", "Roberto Bean", "Carlos Cerrada"], "keywords": ["product customisation", "production engineering computing", "solid modelling", "configurable features", "core features", "dead features", "mass customization", "personalized products", "variability models", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Context modeling", "Feature extraction", "IEEE Standards", "Mass customization", "Product design", "Configuration model", "Core feature", "Dead feature", "Feature model", "Mass customization", "Product platform", "Variability model", "configuration model", "core feature", "dead feature", "feature model", "product platform", "variability model", ""], "arnumber": "7322184"}
