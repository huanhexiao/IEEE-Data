Using large-scale antenna systems and high-bandwidth spectrum, such SBS can theoretically achieve the anticipated future data bandwidth demand of 10000 fold in the next 20 years. We look to exploit small cell distances to simplify SBS design, particularly considering dense indoor installations. We compare theoretical results, based on a link budget analysis, with the system simulation of a densely deployed indoor network using appropriate mmWave channel propagation conditions. The frequency diverse bands of 28 and 72 GHz of the mmWave spectrum are assumed in the analysis. We investigate the performance of low-complexity approaches using a minimal number of antennas at the base station and the user equipment. Using the appropriate power consumption models and the state-of-the-art sub-component power usage, we determine the total power consumption and the energy efficiency of such systems. With mmWave being typified nonline-of-sight communication, we further investigate and propose the use of direct sequence spread spectrum as a means to overcome this, and discuss the use of multipath detection and combining as a suitable mechanism to maximize link reliability.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1562", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1572", "date_publication": "Thu Aug 27 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15443735", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Sep 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1562 - 1572", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["David Muirhead", "Muhammad Ali Imran", "Kamran Arshad"], "keywords": ["5G mobile communication", "cellular radio", "indoor communication", "millimetre wave antennas", "multipath channels", "radio spectrum management", "radiowave propagation", "telecommunication network reliability", "SBS design", "dense indoor installations", "direct sequence spread spectrum", "energy efficiency determination", "future 5G millimeter-wave indoor deployments", "future data bandwidth", "high-bandwidth spectrum", "indoor dense networks", "large-scale antenna systems", "link budget analysis", "link reliability maximization", "low-complexity 5G small-cell base-station design", "millimeter wave channel propagation conditions", "multipath detection", "non line-of-sight communication", "subcomponent power usage", "total power consumption determination", "user equipment", "Array signal processing", "Base stations", "Delays", "Interference", "Omnidirectional antennas", "Receivers", "Signal to noise ratio", "5G", "Air interface design", "MIMO", "Small Cell", "air interface design", "beamforming", "densification", "mmWave", "small cell", ""], "arnumber": "7226781"}
