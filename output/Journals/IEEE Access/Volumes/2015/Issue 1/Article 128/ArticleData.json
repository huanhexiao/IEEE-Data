Both single-hop and multi-hop cases are considered. For the single-hop scenario, a binary integer programming problem is formulated by incorporating a general interference model for directional transmissions and a Markov chain-based blockage model. Two effective solution algorithms are proposed, including a greedy algorithm that maximizes the instant throughput for each time slot, and a column generation-based algorithm that iteratively improves the current link schedule. For the multi-hop scenario, we develop a more complicated problem formulation incorporating both route selection and flow conservation constraints. We also develop an effective algorithm to solve the multi-hop problem. The performance of the proposed algorithms is validated with simulations.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1437", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1449", "date_publication": "Wed Aug 19 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15422973", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Sep 10 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1437 - 1449", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Zhifeng He", "Shiwen Mao", "Theodore Ted S.
