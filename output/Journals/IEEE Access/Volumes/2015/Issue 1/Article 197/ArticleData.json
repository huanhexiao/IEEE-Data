With an increasing number of smart devices being connected to the Internet, the demand for secure communication will only increase. An important outgrowth of Internet-connected devices is the embedding of sensors. Yet, there remains a paucity of good protocols to provide sensor-based secure RNG seeds. In their raw form, sensor data are a weak source of RNG seeds for two reasons: 1) adversarial control - a malicious party gaining control of the sensor and generating a known data sequence and 2) collinearity across sensors - inherent correlated sequences generated because sensors are embedded in the same device. We propose a new seeding technique that leverages sensor data to provide secure seeds for RNG. Given the current proliferation of sensors and Internet-connectivity on smart devices, this technique could increase cybersecurity in a variety of domains, without additional cost.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "562", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "568", "date_publication": "Fri May 15 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15210759", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 01 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "562 - 568", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Siang Lee Hong", "Chang Liu"], "keywords": ["Internet", "cryptography", "data privacy", "random number generation", "sensors", "Internet-connected devices", "cybersecurity", "privacy measures", "secure communication", "security measures", "sensor-based random number generator seeding", "sensor-based secure RNG seeds", "sensors", "smart devices", "Computer secuity", "Generators", "Intelligent sensors", "Internet", "Privacy", "Protocols", "Random number generation", "Industry applications", "computer security", "encryption", "random number generation", "security", ""], "arnumber": "7109113"}
