As an energy provider, the power grid is evolving into a smarter one, which allows more energy-efficient cellular networks and enables cooperation and interaction with the smart grid. On one hand, cellular networks can use harvested renewable energy and on-site energy storage to reduce their energy costs. On the other hand, the price of electricity depends on the energy load, which will eventually contribute to decreasing the peak consumption and global energy cost. In this paper, we propose new integration architecture for renewable energy-powered cellular networks and the smart grid. The proposed architecture is designed based on the classification and the analysis of the existing proposals and the requirements of the smart grid, renewable energy systems, and cellular networks.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2755", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2770", "date_publication": "Fri Dec 11 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15656100", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 29 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2755 - 2770", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Hussein Al Haj Hassan", "Alexander Pelov", "Loutfi Nuaymi"], "keywords": ["cellular radio", "cost reduction", "energy harvesting", "environmental factors", "renewable energy sources", "smart power grids", "cellular base stations", "decrease peak consumption", "electricity price", "energy costs reduction", "energy-efficient cellular networks", "green networks", "integration architecture", "on-site energy storage", "operational costs reduction", "power grid", "renewable energy-powered cellular networks", "smart grid", "Base stations", "Energy consumption", "Green products", "Mobile communication", "Renewable energy sources", "Smart grids", "Cellular networks", "Energy efficiency", "Integration architecture", "Renewable energy", "Smart Grid", "energy efficiency", "integration architecture", "renewable energy", "smart grid", ""], "arnumber": "7353091"}
