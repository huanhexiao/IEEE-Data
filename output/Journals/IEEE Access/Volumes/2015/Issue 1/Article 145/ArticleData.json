The definition of the material opportunity is given by the sawmill industry in Mexico, which produces about 2 million tons of sawdust per year, almost all wasted, and another important waste material: plastic. Each year, Mexico produces 992 000 tons of low density polyethylene. These two waste products can be used as raw materials to create wood plastic composite.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1260", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1271", "date_publication": "Thu Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15352002", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 12 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1260 - 1271", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Angel Daniel Mu\u00f1oz Guzman", "Mar\u00eda Giovanna Trotta Munno"], "keywords": ["acoustic wave absorption", "brick", "design engineering", "dust", "ecocomposites", "filled polymers", "mechanical strength", "recycling", "structural engineering", "wood", "Mexico", "brick redesign", "low density polyethylene", "plastic waste", "raw materials", "sawdust", "sawmill industry", "sound absorption properties", "structural strength", "waste material", "wood plastic composite", "Acoustic absorption", "Design methodology", "Solid modeling", "Solids", "Structures", "Acoustic absorption", "Brick", "Design", "LDPE", "Plastic", "Sawdust", "Structure", "WPC", "Wood", "brick", "design", "plastic", "sawdust", "structure", "wood", ""], "arnumber": "7181640"}
