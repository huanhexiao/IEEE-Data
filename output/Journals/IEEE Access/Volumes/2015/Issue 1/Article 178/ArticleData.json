However, it is difficult to build an entire game for education from scratch, because the task requires high-level programming skills and expertise to understand the graphics and physics. Recently, there have been many different game artificial intelligence (AI) competitions, ranging from board games to the state-of-the-art video games (car racing, mobile games, first-person shooting games, real-time strategy games, and so on). The competitions have been designed such that participants develop their own AI module on top of public/commercial games. Because the materials are open to the public, it is quite useful to adopt them for an undergraduate course project. In this paper, we report our experiences using the Angry Birds AI Competition for such a project-based course. In the course, teams of students consider computer vision, strategic decision-making, resource management, and bug-free coding for their outcome. To promote understanding of game contents generation and extensive testing on the generalization abilities of the student's AI program, we developed software to help them create user-created levels. Students actively participated in the project and the final outcome was comparable with that of successful entries in the 2013 International Angry Birds AI Competition. Furthermore, it leads to the development of a new parallelized Angry Birds AI Competition platform with undergraduate students aiming to use advanced optimization algorithms for their controllers.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "793", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "804", "date_publication": "Mon Jun 22 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15228047", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 23 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "793 - 804", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Du-Mim Yoon", "Kyung-Joong Kim"], "keywords": ["artificial intelligence", "computer aided instruction", "computer games", "computer science education", "computer vision", "decision making", "educational courses", "further education", "Angry Birds AI competition", "advanced optimization algorithms", "bug-free coding", "computer vision", "game AI competitions", "game artificial intelligence education", "project-based course", "resource management", "strategic decision-making", "undergraduate students", "Artificial intelligence", "Computer science education", "Education", "Entertainment", "Game theory", "Learning systems", "Angry Birds", "Artificial intelligence (AI)", "Computing education", "Game", "Game competition", "Game-based learning", "Program design", "artificial intelligence (AI)", "edutainment", "game", "game competition", "game-based learning", "program design", ""], "arnumber": "7130561"}
