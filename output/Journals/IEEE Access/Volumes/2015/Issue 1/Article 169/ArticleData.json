A major disadvantage of flooding is that, in a large-scale network, this blind-choice strategy usually incurs an enormous traffic overhead. In this paper, we propose a method, called the statistical matrix form (SMF), which improves the flooding mechanism by selecting neighbors according to their capabilities. The SMF measures the following peer characteristics: (1) the number of shared files; (2) the content quality; (3) the query service; and (4) the transmission distance between neighbors. Based on these measurements, appropriate peers can be selected, thereby reducing the traffic overhead significantly. Our experimental results demonstrate that the SMF is effective and efficient. For example, compared with the flooding search mechanism in dynamic unstructured P2P networks, the SMF reduces the traffic overhead by more than 80%. Moreover, it achieves a good success rate and shorter response times.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "926", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "941", "date_publication": "Fri Jun 12 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15247877", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Jul 06 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "926 - 941", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Chia-Hung Lin", "Jing-Jia Zseng", "Sun-Yuan Hsieh"], "keywords": ["matrix algebra", "peer-to-peer computing", "query processing", "statistical analysis", "telecommunication traffic", "SMF measures", "blind-choice strategy", "content quality", "dynamic unstructured P2P networks", "file search mechanism", "flooding mechanism improvement", "flooding search mechanism", "large-scale network", "peer characteristics", "peer selection", "query broadcasting", "query service", "search mechanism improvement", "statistical matrix form", "traffic overhead", "transmission distance", "unstructured peer-to-peer networks", "IP networks", "Information retrieval", "Network topology", "Peer-to-peer computing", "Query processing", "Radio frequency", "Search methods", "Unstructured peer-to-peer networks", "flooding search mechanism", "statistical matrix form", "traffic overhead", ""], "arnumber": "7122855"}
