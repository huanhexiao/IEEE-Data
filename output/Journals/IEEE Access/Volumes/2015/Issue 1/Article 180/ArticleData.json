Applying the standard MLFMA to the computation of the partial matrix vector products results in significant redundancy, causing a loss of efficiency of the stationary method. The efficiency can be regained by implementing a modified MLFMA that is based on two simple algorithms. These involve determining precisely what a small subset of cubes is in need of having their associated fields recomputed in the MLFMA upward or downward process during each step of the BBFB process. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and the accuracy of the proposed method over the standard method. Although the modified MLFMA is only applied for the BBFB in this paper, it can, in principle, be extended for application to other stationary methods.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "774", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "786", "date_publication": "Mon Jun 01 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15210749", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Jun 17 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "774 - 786", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Vinh Pham-Xuan", "Marissa Condon", "Conor Brennan"], "keywords": ["digital arithmetic", "electrical engineering computing", "electromagnetic wave propagation", "iterative methods", "matrix multiplication", "BBFB", "MLFMA", "buffered block forward backward method", "electromagnetic wave propagation", "modified multilevel fast multipole algorithm", "partial matrix vector products", "scattering problems", "stationary iterative solvers", "stationary methods", "Accelerometers", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Computational electromagnetics", "Electromagnetics", "Iterative methods", "Method of moments", "Computational electromagnetics", "acceleration techniques", "method of moments (MoM)", "stationary iterative solver", ""], "arnumber": "7113791"}
