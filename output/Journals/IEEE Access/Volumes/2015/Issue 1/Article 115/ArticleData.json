In the proposed IANFIS, by directly minimizing the root-mean-squared-error performance criterion, the Taguchi-genetic learning algorithm is used in the ANFIS to find both the optimal premise and consequent parameters and to simultaneously determine the most suitable membership functions. The five design parameters of SAW gas sensors are considered to be the input variables of the IANFIS model. The input variables include the number of electrode finger pairs, the electrode overlap, the separation distance of two interdigital transducers on the substrate, the dimensions of the stable temperature-cut (ST-cut) quartz substrate, and the electrode thickness. The output variable of the IANFIS model is composed of the resonant frequency shift performance. The results predicted by the proposed IANFIS are compared with those obtained by the back-propagation neural network. The comparison has shown that the performance prediction of resonant frequency shift using the proposed IANFIS is effective. In addition, the sensitivity analyses of the five design parameters have also shown that both the electrode overlap and the dimensions of the ST-cut quartz substrate have the most influence on the resonant frequency shift performance.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1614", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1619", "date_publication": "Fri Sep 18 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15478870", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Sep 29 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1614 - 1619", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Jinn-Tsong Tsai", "Kai-Yu Chiu", "Jyh-Horng Chou"], "keywords": ["Taguchi methods", "computerised instrumentation", "electrochemical electrodes", "fuzzy reasoning", "gas sensors", "genetic algorithms", "interdigital transducers", "learning (artificial intelligence)", "mean square error methods", "quartz", "sensitivity analysis", "surface acoustic wave sensors", "IANFIS model", "SAW gas sensor", "ST-cut quartz substrate", "Taguchi-genetic learning algorithm", "adaptive neurofuzzy inference system", "backpropagation neural network", "electrode finger pair", "interdigital transducer", "resonant frequency shift performance", "root-mean-squared-error performance criterion", "sensitivity analysis", "stable temperature-cut quartz substrate", "surface acoustic wave gas sensor", "Adaptive systems", "Fuzzy neural networks", "Gas sensors", "Genetic algorithms", "Sensors", "Surface acoustic wave devices", "Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system", "Taguchi-genetic learning algorithm", "surface acoustic wave (SAW) gas sensors", ""], "arnumber": "7272035"}
