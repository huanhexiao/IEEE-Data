However, the deployment of legacy VPLS architectures in large-scale networks is challenging due to unresolved security and scalability issues. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical VPLS architecture based on host identity protocol. The proposed architecture tackles both security and scalability issues in legacy VPLS architectures. It secures the VPLS network by delivering vital security features such as authentication, confidentiality, integrity, availability, and secured control protocol. The security analysis and simulation results confirm that the proposed architecture is protected from various IP-based attacks as well. Theoretical analysis and simulation results have also verified that the proposed architecture provides scalability in control, forwarding, and security planes. Finally, the data plane performance of the proposed architecture is measured in a real-world testbed implementation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "967", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "984", "date_publication": "Thu Jun 18 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15266471", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jul 09 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "967 - 984", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Madhusanka Liyanage", "Mika Ylianttila", "Andrei Gurtov"], "keywords": ["local area networks", "protocols", "telecommunication security", "virtualisation", "IP-based attacks", "hierarchical VPLS architecture", "industrial networks", "layer 2 virtual private network technique", "provider provisioned networks", "secured control protocol", "security analysis", "virtual private LAN service", "Data security", "Hierarchical systems", "Local area networks", "Scalability", "Virtual private networks", "HIP", "Hierarchical", "Scalability", "Security", "VPLS", "VPN", "hierarchical", "scalability", "security", ""], "arnumber": "7128323"}
