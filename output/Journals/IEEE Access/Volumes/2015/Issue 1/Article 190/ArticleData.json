Therefore, they may impose an excessive complexity. As an attractive design alternative, differential modulation relying on noncoherent detection may be invoked for eliminating the requirement for channel estimation at the base station, although at the cost of some performance degradation. In this treatise, we propose low-complexity hard-input hard-output, hard-input soft-output, as well as soft-input soft-output quantum-assisted multiple symbol differential detectors (MSDDs) that perform equivalently to the optimal, but highly complex maximum a posteriori probability MSDDs in multiuser systems, where the users are separated both in the frequency domain and in the time domain. When using an MSDD, the detection of a user's symbols is performed over windows of differentially modulated symbols; hence, they exhibit an increased complexity with respect to the conventional differential detector while simultaneously improving the performance of the system, especially at high Doppler frequencies.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "569", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "598", "date_publication": "Tue May 12 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15210753", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jun 04 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "569 - 598", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Panagiotis Botsinis", "Dimitrios Alanis", "Zunaira Babar", "Soon Xin Ng", "Lajos Hanzo"], "keywords": ["channel estimation", "differential detection", "frequency-domain analysis", "maximum likelihood estimation", "radio networks", "time-domain analysis", "Doppler frequency", "airports", "base station", "channel estimation", "channel gains", "coherent detection", "cooperative multicell processing", "differential modulation", "differentially-modulated symbols", "frequency domain", "high-user density", "large-dimensional wireless systems", "low-complexity hard-input hard-output quantum-assisted MSDD", "low-complexity hard-input soft-output quantum-assisted MSDD", "low-complexity soft-input soft-output quantum-assisted MSDD", "massive multiple-input multiple-output systems", "maximum a posteriori probability MSDD", "metropolitan area", "millimeterwave systems", "multiuser systems", "noncoherent detection", "noncoherent quantum multiple-symbol differential detection", "time domain", "train stations", "user symbol detection", "Computational complexity", "MIMO", "Multiple-symbol differential", "Quantum computing", "Wireless networks", "Computational Complexity", "Computational complexity", "D??rr-H??yer algorithm", "Differential Modulation", "Durr-H&#x00F8", "yer Algorithm", "EXIT chart", "Grover&#x2019", "s Quantum Search Algorithm", "Grover???s quantum search algorithm", "MIMO", "Multiple-Symbol Differential Detection,", "Non-Coherent Detection,", "Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing,", "Quantum Computing", "differential modulation", "multiple input multiple output", "multiple-symbol differential detection", "non-coherent detection", "orthogonal frequency division multiplexing", "quantum computing", ""], "arnumber": "7105828"}
