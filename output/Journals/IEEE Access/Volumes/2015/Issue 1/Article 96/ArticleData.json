It is a two-step methodology, with a pre-segmentation step and a segmentation refinement step, as follows. First, the user performs a rough segmenting of the desired region of interest. Second, a fully automatic refinement step is applied to the pre-segmented data. The automatic segmentation refinement is composed of several sub-steps, namely, image deconvolution, image cropping, and interpolation. The user-defined pre-segmentation is then refined over the deconvolved, cropped, and up-sampled version of the image. The performance of the proposed algorithm is exemplified with the segmentation of CT images of a composite femur bone, reconstructed with different reconstruction protocols. Segmentation outcomes are validated against a gold standard model, obtained using the coordinate measuring machine Nikon Metris LK V20 with a digital line scanner LC60-D and a resolution of $28~mu text{m}$ . High sub-pixel accuracy models are obtained for all tested data sets, with a maximum average deviation of 0.178 mm from the gold standard. The algorithm is able to produce high quality segmentation of the composite femur regardless of the surface meshing strategy used.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1894", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1906", "date_publication": "Wed Sep 30 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15543313", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 26 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1894 - 1906", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Manuel Pinheiro", "J.
