A set of 10 EDs were exposed to temperature humidity life testing of 85% RH and 85 \u00b0C (85/85) without an electrical bias per the JEDEC standard JESD22-A101C in order to accelerate the ingress of moisture into the aluminum electrolytic capacitor (AEC) and the EDs in order to assess the reliability of the LED drivers for harsh environment applications. The capacitance and equivalent series resistance for each AEC inside the ED were measured using a handheld LCR meter as possible leading indications of failure. The photometric quantities of a single pristine light engine were monitored in order to investigate the interaction between the light engine and the EDs. These parameters were used in assessing the overall reliability of the EDs. In addition, a comparative analysis has been conducted between the 85/85 accelerated test data and a previously published high-temperature storage life accelerated test of 135 \u00b0C. The results of the 85/85 acceleration test and the comparative analysis are presented in this paper.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "531", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "542", "date_publication": "Thu Feb 19 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15138341", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu May 21 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "531 - 542", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Pradeep Lall", "Peter Sakalaukus", "Lynn Davis"], "keywords": ["aluminium", "driver circuits", "electrolytic capacitors", "failure analysis", "life testing", "reliability", "Al", "accelerated aging", "aluminum electrolytic capacitor", "capacitance", "equivalent series resistance", "failure modes", "handheld LCR meter", "harsh environment applications", "reliability", "solid-state lighting electrical drivers", "temperature humidity life testing", "Capacitors", "Electrochemical machining", "LED lamps", "Light emitting diodes", "Lighting", "Solid state lighting", "Electrolytic Capacitor", "Electrolytic capacitor", "LED", "Solid-State Lighting", "solid-state lighting", ""], "arnumber": "7045442"}
