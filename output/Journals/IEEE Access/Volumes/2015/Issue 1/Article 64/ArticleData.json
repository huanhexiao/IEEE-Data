In this paper, we present a Lyapunov optimization-based scheme for cloud offloading scheduling, as well as download scheduling for cloud execution output, for multiple applications running in a mobile device with a multi-core CPU. We derive an online algorithm and prove performance bounds for the proposed algorithm with respect to average power consumption and average queue length, which is indicative of delay, and reveal the fundamental tradeoff between the two optimization goals. The performance of the proposed online scheduling scheme is validated with trace-driven simulations.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2306", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2316", "date_publication": "Tue Nov 10 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15607719", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Nov 24 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2306 - 2316", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Zhefeng Jiang", "Shiwen Mao"], "keywords": ["Lyapunov methods", "cloud computing", "digital simulation", "energy conservation", "mobile computing", "multiprocessing systems", "optimisation", "power aware computing", "processor scheduling", "Lyapunov optimization-based scheme", "cloud execution output", "cloud offloading", "cloud offloading scheduling", "download scheduling", "energy conservation", "energy delay tradeoff", "multicore CPU", "multicore mobile device", "online scheduling scheme", "resource limited mobile device", "trace driven simulation", "Cloud computing", "Energy conservation", "Energy efficiency", "Job shop scheduling", "Load management", "Lyapunov optimization", "Storage management", "Cloud computing", "Lyapunov optimization", "energy efficiency", "job scheduling", "offloading", ""], "arnumber": "7323792"}
