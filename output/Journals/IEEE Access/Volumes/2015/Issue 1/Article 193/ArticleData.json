A majority of researchers working on robot grasping and object manipulation tend to utilize commercially available robot-manipulators equipped with various end effectors for experimental studies. However, commercially available robotic grippers are often expensive and are not easy to modify for specific purposes. To extend the choice of robotic end effectors freely available to researchers and educators, we present an open-source low-cost three-finger robotic gripper platform for research and educational purposes. The 3-D design model of the gripper is presented and manufactured with a minimal number of 3-D-printed components and an off-the-shelf servo actuator. An underactuated finger and gear train mechanism, with an overall gripper assembly design, are described in detail, followed by illustrations and a discussion of the gripper grasping performance and possible gripper platform modifications. The presented open-source gripper platform computer-aided design model is released for downloading on the authors research lab website (<;uri xlink:href=\"http://www.alaris.kz\" xlink:type=\"simple\">www.alaris.kz<;/uri>) and can be utilized by robotics researchers and educators as a design platform to build their own robotic end effector solutions for research and educational purposes.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "638", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "647", "date_publication": "Fri May 15 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15210761", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 01 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "638 - 647", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Kuat Telegenov", "Yedige Tlegenov", "Almas Shintemirov"], "keywords": ["CAD", "control engineering computing", "design engineering", "educational robots", "end effectors", "gears", "grippers", "public domain software", "servomechanisms", "three-dimensional printing", "3-D design model", "3-D-printed components", "commercially available robot-manipulators", "commercially available robotic grippers", "educational purposes", "gear train mechanism", "gripper assembly design", "industrial robots", "low-cost open-source 3-D-printed three-finger gripper platform", "object manipulation", "off-the-shelf servo actuator", "open-source gripper platform computer-aided design model", "research lab Website", "research purposes", "robot grasping", "robotic end effectors", "service robots", "underactuated finger", "Education", "End effectors", "Grasping", "Grippers", "Open source software", "Printed circuits", "Robots", "Three-dimensional displays", "3D printing", "Open-source robotic gripper", "adaptive grasping", "gear train mechanism", "open-source robotic gripper", "underactuation", ""], "arnumber": "7109102"}
