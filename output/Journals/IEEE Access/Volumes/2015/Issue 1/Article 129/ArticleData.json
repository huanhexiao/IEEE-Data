In particular, a novel scheduling algorithm is proposed that achieves a more uniform distribution of user-throughput than that of the state-of-the-art maximum-throughput (MT) schedulers. The proposed scheduling algorithm also takes the coherence time of the channel into account as well as the impact to the acquired channel state information. A novel radio frame structure that is appropriate for achieving a 1-ms round trip time latency is also proposed. Such a low latency allows one to employ multiuser as well as cooperative multiple input multiple output schemes for mobile users. An evaluation of matched-filter and zero-forcing precoding for mobile users in UDNs is included. The performance of the proposed 5G UDN concept is assessed using a system-level simulator. Extensive numerical results show that the proposed borderless scheduling concept achieves ~77% higher median user-throughput than that of the MT scheduler at the cost of ~17% lower area-throughput. Such results are obtained for a high density of mobile users at velocities of ~50 km/h.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1462", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1476", "date_publication": "Thu Aug 20 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15422952", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 04 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1462 - 1476", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Petteri Kela", "Jussi Turkka", "M\u00e1rio Costa"], "keywords": ["5G mobile communication", "MIMO communication", "cooperative communication", "matched filters", "mobility management (mobile radio)", "precoding", "scheduling", "wireless channels", "5G UDN concept", "borderless 5G outdoor ultra-dense networks", "borderless mobility", "channel coherence time", "channel state information acquisition", "cooperative multiple input multiple output schemes", "matched-filter evaluation", "radio frame structure", "round trip time latency", "scheduling algorithm", "system-level simulator", "user-throughput uniform distribution", "zero-forcing precoding evaluation", "5G mobile communication", "Dense networks", "Mobile communication", "Scheduling", "5G Networks", "5G networks", "Mobility", "Scheduling", "Ultra-Dense Networks", "mobility", "scheduling", "ultra-dense networks", ""], "arnumber": "7214194"}
