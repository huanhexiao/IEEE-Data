The cooperation of various chassis and powertrain systems is discussed from a viewpoint of improvement of vehicle performance in relation to longitudinal, lateral, and vertical motion dynamics. The classification of IMC systems is proposed. Particular attention is placed on the architecture and methods of subsystems integration.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2080", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2099", "date_publication": "Thu Oct 29 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15576556", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 09 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2080 - 2099", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Valentin Ivanov", "Dzmitry Savitski"], "keywords": ["automobiles", "motion control", "power transmission (mechanical)", "road traffic control", "vehicle dynamics", "IMC systems", "automotive control systems", "chassis", "ground vehicles", "integrated motion control systematization", "lateral motion dynamics", "longitudinal motion dynamics", "powertrain systems", "vertical motion dynamics", "Automotive electronics", "Control systems", "Motion control", "Safety", "Vehicle safety", "Vehicles", "Motion control", "road vehicles", "vehicle dynamics", "vehicle safety", ""], "arnumber": "7312395"}
