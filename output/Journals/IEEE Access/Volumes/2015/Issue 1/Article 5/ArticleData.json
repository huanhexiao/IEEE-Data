DML gates utilize two different modes of operation, dynamic and static, to selectively achieve either high-performance or low-energy operation. Custom designs of DML circuits have been shown to be very efficient. However, implementing DML circuits using the standard design flow and Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools is very challenging, since DML gates operate in two different modes, each with its own characteristics and operating mechanisms. This paper shows, for the first time, that DML logic can be compatible with the standard design flow and optimized by various tools, such as synthesis and physical design. A DML cell library characterization methodology is also proposed to support the design flow. The methodology and flow were verified on a wide variety of benchmark designs with different gate counts and logic depths, and show that DML design is efficient under the standard design flow restrictions.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "3089", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "3101", "date_publication": "Mon Jan 04 00:00:00 EST 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15690360", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 18 00:00:00 EST 2016", "pages": "3089 - 3101", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Viacheslav Yuzhaninov", "Itamar Levi", "Alexander Fish"], "keywords": ["electronic design automation", "logic circuits", "logic design", "logic gates", "CMOS technology", "DML cell library characterization methodology", "DML circuit", "DML gate", "EDA tool", "dual mode logic circuit", "electronic design automation tool", "energy-delay", "standard design flow restriction", "CMOS integrated circuits", "Libraries", "Logic gates", "Robustness", "Standards", "Timing", "Transistors", "Dual Mode Logic (DML)", "Dynamic logic", "Standard design flow", "alternative logic family", "dual mode logic (DML)", "dynamic logic", ""], "arnumber": "7370913"}
