The efficiency of the use of radio spectrum for wireless communications can be dramatically increased by dynamic secondary spectrum sharing; an intelligent approach that allows unlicensed devices access to those parts of the spectrum that are otherwise underutilized by the incumbent users. In this paper, we propose a heuristically accelerated reinforcement learning (HARL)-based framework, designed for dynamic secondary spectrum sharing in Long Term Evolution cellular systems. It utilizes a radio environment map as external information for guiding the learning process of cognitive cellular systems. System level simulations of a stadium temporary event scenario show that the schemes based on the proposed HARL framework achieve high controllability of spectrum sharing patterns in a fully autonomous way. This results in a significant decrease in the primary system quality of service degradation due to interference from the secondary cognitive systems, compared with a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning solution and a purely heuristic typical LTE solution. The spectrum sharing patterns that emerge by using the proposed schemes also result in remarkable reliability of the cognitive eNodeB on the aerial platform. Furthermore, the novel principle and the general structure of heuristic functions proposed in the context of HARL are applicable to a wide range of self-organization problems beyond the wireless communications domain.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2771", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2783", "date_publication": "Wed Dec 09 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15656102", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 29 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2771 - 2783", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Nils Morozs", "Tim Clarke", "David Grace"], "keywords": ["Long Term Evolution", "cellular radio", "learning (artificial intelligence)", "quality of service", "radio spectrum management", "telecommunication computing", "HARL-based framework", "Long Term Evolution cellular systems", "aerial platform", "cognitive cellular systems", "cognitive eNodeB", "dynamic secondary spectrum sharing", "flexible cellular system architectures", "heuristic typical LTE solution", "heuristically accelerated reinforcement learning process", "intelligent approach", "mobile data capacity", "radio environment map", "radio spectrum management techniques", "self-organization problems", "stadium temporary event scenario", "system level simulations", "system quality of service degradation", "wireless communications domain", "Acceleration", "Decision support systems", "Heuristic algorithms", "Interference", "Learning (artificial intelligence)", "Mobile communication", "Wireless communication", "Dynamic Spectrum Access", "Heuristically Accelerated Reinforcement Learning", "Heuristically accelerated reinforcement learning", "Spectrum Sharing", "dynamic spectrum access", "spectrum sharing", ""], "arnumber": "7350209"}
