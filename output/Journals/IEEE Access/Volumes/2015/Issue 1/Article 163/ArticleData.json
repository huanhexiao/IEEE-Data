This paper investigates their statistics, relation, and modeling, based on large-scale measurement data from commercial cellular networks. The spatial distribution of BSs shows not only high nonuniformity over a region but also diverse patterns in different regions, and thus the widely used homogeneous Poisson point process can only approximate the BS patterns in a specific small area. Therefore, the inhomogeneous PPP (IPPP), in particular, the Cox point process with spatially varying intensity is used to model the BS distribution over any spatial scale. To model the intensity distribution of the IPPP, we exploit the relation, shown to be sublinear, between the BS distribution and the peak hour (PH) traffic density, based on the finding that the PH traffic density can be approximated by a log-normal distribution. Finally, we propose a spatial modeling framework for network simulations, and discuss potential applications of the proposed spatial distribution model of the BS patterns and the PH traffic density.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "998", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1010", "date_publication": "Thu Jul 02 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15298249", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jul 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "998 - 1010", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Sheng Zhou", "Dongheon Lee", "Bingjie Leng", "Xuan Zhou", "Honggang Zhang", "Zhisheng Niu"], "keywords": ["cellular radio", "telecommunication network planning", "telecommunication traffic", "Cox point process", "IPPP", "base stations", "cellular networks", "green cellular networking", "inhomogeneous PPP", "log-normal distribution", "network planning", "spatial distribution", "traffic demands", "traffic density", "Base stations", "Cellular networks", "Modeling", "Pattern recognition", "Poisson equations", "Spatial analysis", "Telecommunication traffic", "Cox point process", "Spatial analysis and modeling", "inhomogeneous Poisson point process", "spatial pattern of base stations", "traffic density", ""], "arnumber": "7147784"}
