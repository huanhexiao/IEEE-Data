However, the dynamic profiling must be able to accurately capture application behavior without incurring significant runtime overheads. Since application- and sensor-specific constraints dictate the profiling requirements and tolerated overheads, designers require design assistance to quickly evaluate and select appropriate profiling methodologies. To increase designer productivity, we formulate profiling methodology design guidelines based on extensive evaluation and analysis of a variety of profiling methodologies suitable for dynamically monitoring WSNs with respect to network traffic overhead, power, and code impacts associated with each method. While energy consumption increases are reasonable, ranging from 0.5% to 2.6%, network traffic, code size, and computation time overheads can be as high as 66.2%, 75.9%, and 136.6%, respectively. Our results show that these overhead variations are highly application specific, and a single profiling method is not suitable for all types of application behavior, thus necessitating, application-specific profiling methodology customization. To facilitate rapid development of these profiling methodologies, we present a profiler-customization methodology consisting of a code generator module, overhead estimation module, and profile data management module. Using our profiling-customization methodology, designers can rapidly evaluate the overhead of different profiling methodologies, and automatically integrate the most appropriate methodology into the application at design time.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "303", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "322", "date_publication": "Tue Apr 14 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15070639", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Apr 24 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "303 - 322", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Lu Ding", "Adrian Lizarraga", "Ashish Shenoy", "Ann Gordon-Ross", "Susan Lysecky", "Roman Lysecky"], "keywords": ["energy consumption", "telecommunication traffic", "wireless sensor networks", "WSN", "application-specific profiling methodology customization", "application-specific tuning", "code generator module", "dynamic profiling mechanisms", "environmental conditions", "network traffic overhead", "overhead estimation module", "productivity", "profile data management module", "profiler-customization methodology", "profiling-customization methodology", "sensor-specific constraints", "wireless sensor networks", "Adaptive algorithms", "Computer applications", "Dynamic programming", "Embedded systems", "Optimization", "Sensor networks", "Wireless sensor networks", "Adaptive algorithm", "dynamic profiling", "dynamic profiling and optimization (DPOP)", "embedded software", "wireless sensor networks (WSN)", ""], "arnumber": "7086003"}
