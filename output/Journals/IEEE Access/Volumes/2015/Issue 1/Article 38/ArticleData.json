Based on the parallel processing and flexible storage capabilities of cloud computing, in this paper, we propose a practical massive video management platform using Hadoop, which can achieve a fast video processing (such as video summary, encoding, and decoding) using MapReduce, with good usability, performance, and availability. Red5 streaming media server is used to get video stream from Hadoop distributed file system, and Flex is used to play video in browsers. A user-friendly interface is designed for managing the whole platform in a browser-server style using J2EE. In addition, we show our experiences on how to fine-tune the Hadoop to get optimized performance for different video processing tasks. The evaluations show that the proposed platform can satisfy the requirements of massive video data management.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2637", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2643", "date_publication": "Fri Dec 11 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15656092", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 22 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2637 - 2643", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Xin Liu", "Dehai Zhao", "Liang Xu", "Weishan Zhang", "Jijun Yin", "Xiufeng Chen"], "keywords": ["cloud computing", "data handling", "parallel processing", "video streaming", "Flex", "Hadoop distributed file system", "J2EE", "MapReduce", "Red5 streaming media server", "browser-server style", "cloud platform", "decoding", "distributed video data management", "encoding", "massive video management platform", "user-friendly interface", "video processing", "video stream", "video summary", "Browsers", "Cameras", "Flexible printed circuits", "Streaming media", "Throughput", "Web servers", "Hadoop", "J2EE", "MapReduce", "video management", "video processing", ""], "arnumber": "7353119"}
