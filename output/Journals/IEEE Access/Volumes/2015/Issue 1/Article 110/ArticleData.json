The proposed MOP is modeled such that the network providers can dynamically tune the tradeoff parameters to switch between different communication scenarios with diverse design requirements. In order to find its Pareto optimal solution, the MOP is transformed, using a weighted sum method, into a single-objective optimization problem (SOP), which itself can further be transformed from a fractional form, by exploiting fractional programming, into a subtractive form. Since the formulated SOP is hard to solve due to the combinatorial channel allocation indicators, we reformulate the SOP into a better tractable problem by relaxing the combinatorial indicators using the idea of time-sharing. We then prove that this reformulated SOP is strictly quasi-concave with respect to the transmission power and the subcarrier allocation indicator. We then propose an iterative two-layer distributed framework to achieve an upper bound Pareto optimal solution of the original proposed MOP. The numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed two-layer framework achieving an upper bound Pareto optimal solution, which is very close to an optimal solution, with fast convergence, lower and acceptable polynomial complexity, and balanced EE-SE tradeoff.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1655", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1671", "date_publication": "Thu Sep 17 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15494231", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 05 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1655 - 1671", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Haris Pervaiz", "Leila Musavian", "Qiang Ni", "Zhiguo Ding"], "keywords": ["OFDM modulation", "Pareto optimisation", "channel allocation", "combinatorial mathematics", "energy conservation", "iterative methods", "mathematical programming", "multi-access systems", "quality of service", "telecommunication power management", "wireless channels", "Pareto optimal solution", "QoS constraint", "combinatorial channel allocation indicator", "fractional programming", "green heterogeneous network", "iterative two-layer distributed framework", "multiobjective optimization problem", "multiuser multicarrier two-tier orthogonal frequency division multiplexing access heterogeneous network", "polynomial complexity", "single-objective optimization problem", "spectrum efficient transmission technique", "subcarrier allocation indicator", "weighted sum method", "Energy efficiency", "Green communications", "Microcell networks", "Resource management", "Spread spectrum management", "Energy Efficiency and Spectrum Efficiency", "Green Communications", "HetNets", "Resource Allocation", "Small Cells", "energy efficiency and spectrum efficiency", "green communications", "resource allocation", "small cells", ""], "arnumber": "7270991"}
