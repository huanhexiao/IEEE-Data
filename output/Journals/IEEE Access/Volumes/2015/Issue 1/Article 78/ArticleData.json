This system includes Gaussian monocycle pulse (GMP) generation circuits, switching (SW) matrix circuits, equivalent-time sampling circuits, and a compact UWB antenna array. During the detection process, the GMP signal with the center frequency of 6 GHz is first generated and transmitted with a repetition frequency of 100 MHz. The GMP signal is sent to a selected transmitter antenna by the SW matrix module, and the reflected signal is captured by the receiver antennas. Next, the high-speed equivalent-time sampling circuits are employed to retrieve the reflected GMP signal. A confocal algorithm is used to reconstruct the breast image. The total size for the prototype module is 45 cm\u00d730 cm\u00d714.5 cm in length, width, and height, respectively, which is dramatically smaller than the conventional detection systems. Using our proposed system, we demonstrate a successful detection of 1-cm cancer target in the breast phantom.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2111", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2121", "date_publication": "Thu Oct 29 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15638741", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 12 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2111 - 2121", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Hang Song", "Hayato Kono", "Yuji Seo", "Afreen Azhari", "Junichi Somei", "Eiji Suematsu", "Yuichi Watarai", "Toshihiko Ota", "Hiromasa Watanabe", "Yoshinori Hiramatsu", "Akihiro Toya", "Xia Xiao", "Takamaro Kikkawa"], "keywords": ["CMOS integrated circuits", "Gaussian processes", "antenna arrays", "cancer", "image reconstruction", "medical image processing", "microwave imaging", "phantoms", "switching circuits", "ultra wideband antennas", "ultra wideband radar", "CMOS integrated circuits", "Gaussian monocycle pulse generation circuits", "breast image reconstruction", "breast phantom", "compact UWB antenna array", "confocal algorithm", "high-speed equivalent-time sampling circuits", "switching matrix circuits", "ultrawideband radar-based breast cancer detection system", "Biomedical monitoring", "Breast cancer", "Cancer", "Microwave imaging", "Receiving antennas", "Reflector antennas", "Transmitting antennas", "Ultra wideband radar", "Breast cancer", "CMOS", "Ultrawideband", "confocal algorithm", "microwave imaging", "ultrawideband", ""], "arnumber": "7312404"}
