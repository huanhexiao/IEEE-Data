Then, multiple battlefield surveillance systems can be connected together to form a battlefield surveillance network. The mobile nodes can be deployed in a certain region to monitor enemy aircrafts and missiles. Thus, some important issues have to be solved efficiently, including the cooperation across the administrative domains of a cloud network, the direction-of-arrival (DOA), and a polarization estimation algorithm for a mobile wireless sensor network (MWSN). In this paper, the architecture of a battlefield surveillance system is constructed based on mobile cloud computing and 5G link. The root multiple signal classification (Root-MUSIC)-like algorithm is proposed for estimating the 1-D DOA and a polarization parameter with a uniform linear array. The Root-MUSIC algorithm is replaced by the Fourier transform, the former algorithm that can be extended to an arbitrary topology structure of a MWSN. Then, the proposed algorithm is extended to the 2-D DOA and a polarization estimation in further. Based on the deployment of different MWSNs, the estimation results of DOA and polarization parameters are fused in order to improve the estimation performance. Finally, the parameter information (DOA and polarization parameter) of enemy aircrafts and missiles can be achieved. The computer simulation verifies the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm ensures the parameter estimation accuracy with a low computational complexity.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1729", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1739", "date_publication": "Mon Sep 28 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15494249", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 08 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1729 - 1739", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Liangtian Wan", "Guangjie Han", "Lei Shu", "Naixing Feng", "Chunsheng Zhu", "Jaime Lloret"], "keywords": ["5G mobile communication", "Fourier transforms", "aircraft", "cloud computing", "computational complexity", "cooperative communication", "direction-of-arrival estimation", "electromagnetic wave polarisation", "military communication", "military computing", "missiles", "mobile computing", "sensor placement", "signal classification", "surveillance", "telecommunication network topology", "wireless sensor networks", "1D DOA", "2D DOA", "5G link", "Fourier transform", "MWSN", "Root-MUSIC-like algorithm", "battlefield surveillance network", "battlefield surveillance system", "cloud network", "computational complexity", "direction-of-arrival", "distributed parameter estimation", "enemy aircrafts", "missiles", "mobile cloud computing", "mobile devices", "mobile nodes", "mobile wireless sensor network", "polarization estimation algorithm", "root multiple signal classification", "Cloud computing", "Direction-of-arrival estimation", "Military communication", "Mobile communication", "Polarization", "Surveillance", "Warfare", "Wireless sensor networks", "Mobile wireless sensor network (MWSN)", "battlefield surveillance system", "direction-of-arrival (DOA) and polarization estimation", "mobile cloud computing (MCC)", "mobile wireless sensor network (MWSN)", ""], "arnumber": "7279065"}
