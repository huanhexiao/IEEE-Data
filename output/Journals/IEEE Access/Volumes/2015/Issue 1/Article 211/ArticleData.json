The Delphi method is mainly designed for qualitative prediction within a group of experts, where the experts make predictions and a facilitator controls these predictions until the experts end up with a level of consensus. Argument Delphi, as opposed to the classical Delphi model, is built on the contradictions of the ideas of the experts. Argument Delphi mainly focuses on a discussion topic and asks experts to create new arguments and criticize other arguments from other experts. After a certain level of contradiction, the method yields an amount of contradictory, criticized arguments and builds a decision over these antitheses, as in the Hegelian approach. This is the first time the argument Delphi method has been modeled in a graph of arguments and the problem of qualitative decision has been transferred into a graph problem using Delphi method. This paper is also the first time that argument aggregation and evaluation methods have been proposed. Moreover, the computerized version of argument Delphi is applied to real-world problems using crowd involvement through Facebook. The problem is defined as the prediction of petroleum prices for the end of year and more than 100 contributors from all around the world argued and criticized each other. This paper also discusses the findings of this case study.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "368", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "380", "date_publication": "Mon Apr 20 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15087879", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Apr 30 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "368 - 380", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Sadi Evren Seker"], "keywords": ["decision support systems", "expert systems", "forecasting theory", "graph theory", "social networking (online)", "Facebook", "Hegelian approach", "argument Delphi method", "argument aggregation", "classical Delphi model", "computerized argument Delphi technique", "contradictory argument", "criticized argument", "crowd involvement", "evaluation method", "graph problem", "qualitative decision", "qualitative prediction", "Crowdsourcing", "Decision support systems", "Graph theory", "Qualitative analysis", "Social network services", "Crowd Opinion", "Decision Support Systems", "Delphi Technique", "Delphi technique", "Graph Theory", "Qualitative Methods", "Social Network", "crowd opinion", "decision support systems", "graph theory", "qualitative methods", "social network", ""], "arnumber": "7089162"}
