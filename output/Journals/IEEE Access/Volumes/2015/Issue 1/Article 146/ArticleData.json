In our proposed JSPA scheme, SUs adopt the decode-and-forward relaying protocol to help PUs in a two-stage way. Meanwhile, a fraction of unallocated licensed spectrum is allocated for the secondary transmission in every stage. However, if the two-stage cooperation still cannot satisfy the PUs' outage quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, SUs then switch to the access mode and entirely capture the licensed spectrum. Our proposed scheme is to maximize the average transmission rate of SUs through joint optimal subcarriers and power allocation under the constraint of PUs' outage QoS requirement. The closed-form expressions about the outage probability and average transmission of both PUs and SUs are derived, and we prove the optimality of our scheme. Simulation results show that, compared with the conventional cognitive cooperation scheme, the average transmission rate of SUs is improved.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1248", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1259", "date_publication": "Mon Aug 03 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15352001", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 12 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1248 - 1259", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Dawei Wang", "Pinyi Ren", "Qinghe Du", "Li Sun"], "keywords": ["channel allocation", "cognitive radio", "decode and forward communication", "probability", "protocols", "quality of service", "radio spectrum management", "relay networks (telecommunication)", "software defined networking", "JSPA scheme", "PU outage QoS requirement", "access mode", "cognitive radio", "decode and forward relaying protocol", "joint subcarrier and power allocation scheme", "outage probability", "primary users", "reciprocally benefited spectrum access", "secondary transmission", "secondary users", "software defined network", "spectrum efficiency", "ubiquitous spectrum access", "unallocated licensed spectrum allocation", "Cognitive radio", "Cooperative communication", "OFDM", "Quality of service", "Relays", "Resource management", "Software radio", "Spread spectrum management", "Cognitive Radio", "Cooperative Communication", "Joint Subcarrier and Power Allocation", "Reciprocally-Benefited Spectrum Access", "Software-Defined Network", "Software-defined network", "cognitive radio", "cooperative communication", "joint subcarrier and power allocation", "reciprocally-benefited spectrum access", ""], "arnumber": "7174936"}
