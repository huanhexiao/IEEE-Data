Various variants of ELM were recently proposed to enhance the performance of ELM. Circular complex-valued extreme learning machine (CC-ELM), a variant of ELM, exploits the capabilities of complex-valued neuron to achieve better performance. Another variant of ELM, weighted ELM (WELM) handles the class imbalance problem by minimizing a weighted least squares error along with regularization. In this paper, a regularized weighted CC-ELM (RWCC-ELM) is proposed, which incorporates the strength of both CC-ELM and WELM. Proposed RWCC-ELM is evaluated using imbalanced data sets taken from Keel repository. RWCC-ELM outperforms CC-ELM and WELM for most of the evaluated data sets.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "3048", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "3057", "date_publication": "Tue Dec 08 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15707861", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 12 00:00:00 EST 2016", "pages": "3048 - 3057", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Sanyam Shukla", "Ram Narayan Yadav"], "keywords": ["learning (artificial intelligence)", "least squares approximations", "pattern classification", "Keel repository", "complex-valued neuron", "imbalanced learning", "real-valued classification problems", "regularized weighted CC-ELM", "regularized weighted circular complex-valued extreme learning machine", "weighted ELM", "weighted least squares error", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Biological neural networks", "Classification", "Learning systems", "Least squares methods", "Neurons", "Signal processing algorithms", "Class imbalance problem", "Complex valued neural network", "Extreme Learning Machine", "Real valued classification", "Regularization", "Weighted least squares error", "class imbalance problem", "complex valued neural network", "extreme learning machine", "regularization", "weighted least squares error", ""], "arnumber": "7349136"}
