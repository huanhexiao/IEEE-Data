Since relay stations will be an integral part of future cellular networks, we propose evolved non-orthogonal multi-access schemes for both direct and relayed users. Our schedulers are built upon SC-relaying schemes with practical discrete hierarchical modulations (HMs), where the messages of two selected users are superposed into different HM layers, each layer being allocated an optimized amount of power and bearing a message flow to be decoded through either a direct or relayed link. As opposed to conventional schedulers that allocate orthogonal resources to each user in wireless relaying systems, our non-orthogonal schedulers allow a pair of selected users to simultaneously share their allocated resource unit. Moreover, unlike the SC-relaying schemes in the literature based on Gaussian codebooks, the proposed schemes are designed and analyzed under the practical constraints of discrete HMs. In spite of the complexity of the power optimization under discrete HMs, we provide a simple and near-optimal power allocation method for sum-rate maximization and proportional fairness. The simulation results show that the conventional orthogonal schedulers are outperformed by the proposed schedulers in terms of sum rate and fairness, even under the practical assumption of HMs.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2922", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2938", "date_publication": "Mon Dec 07 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15673506", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 05 00:00:00 EST 2016", "pages": "2922 - 2938", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Megumi Kaneko", "Hirofumi Yamaura", "Youhei Kajita", "Kazunori Hayashi", "Hideaki Sakai"], "keywords": ["5G mobile communication", "cellular radio", "encoding", "modulation", "multi-access systems", "optimisation", "telecommunication scheduling", "5G cellular relay networks", "5G cellular systems", "Gaussian codebooks", "SC-relaying", "SC-relaying schemes", "cellular networks", "discrete hierarchical modulation", "discrete hierarchical modulations", "fairness-aware nonorthogonal multiuser access", "message flow", "near-optimal power allocation method", "nonorthogonal multiaccess schemes", "nonorthogonal schedulers", "orthogonal schedulers", "power optimization", "relay stations", "sum-rate maximization", "superposition coding", "wireless relaying systems", "Binary phase shift keying", "Hierarchical systems", "Measurement", "OFDM", "Optimization", "Radio resource allocation", "Relays", "Resource management", "Cellular Relay System", "Cellular relay system", "Hierarchical Modulation", "Non Orthogonal Multiple Access", "Radio Resource Allocation", "Superposition Coding", "hierarchical modulation", "non-orthogonal multiple access", "radio resource allocation", "superposition coding", ""], "arnumber": "7348635"}
