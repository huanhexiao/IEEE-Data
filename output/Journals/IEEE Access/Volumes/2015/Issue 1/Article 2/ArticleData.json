Both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight scenarios were considered. Measurements were performed by fixing a transmit pyramidal horn antenna, and rotating another one in the receiver site at 10\u00b0 steps in azimuth. The antenna outputs are viewed as array signals, and a space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm is applied to estimate delay and angular parameters of multipath components. Benefiting from high resolution achieved by using the SAGE and deembedding of antenna radiation pattern and system responses, more multipath clusters with less spreads in delay and azimuth are found per channel compared with existing works on 28-GHz propagation. The statistics of channel parameters extracted here constitute a preliminary stochastic multipath-cluster spatial channel model.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "3138", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "3150", "date_publication": "Tue Jan 12 00:00:00 EST 2016", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15726943", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 25 00:00:00 EST 2016", "pages": "3138 - 3150", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Xuefeng Yin", "Cen Ling", "Myung-Don Kim"], "keywords": ["antenna radiation patterns", "array signal processing", "expectation-maximisation algorithm", "horn antennas", "microwave propagation", "transmitting antennas", "SAGE algorithm", "angular parameters", "antenna radiation pattern", "array signals", "bandwidth 500 MHz", "channel measurement campaign", "delay estimation", "direction-scan-sounding", "experimental multipath-cluster characteristics", "frequency 28 GHz", "multipath components", "office environments", "space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization algorithm", "stochastic multipath-cluster spatial channel model", "system responses", "transmit pyramidal horn antenna", "wave propagation channels", "Antenna measurements", "Antenna radiation patterns", "Cluster approximation", "Directive antennas", "Horn antennas", "Millimeter wave propagation", "Receiving antennas", "SAGE", "Direction-scan-sounding", "SAGE", "channel measurement", "horn antenna", "millimeter wave propagation", "multipath cluster", ""], "arnumber": "7378822"}
