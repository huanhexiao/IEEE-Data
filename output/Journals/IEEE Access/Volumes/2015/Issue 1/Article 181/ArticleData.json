Considered is a HetNet where multiple newly deployed femtocell base stations (FBSs) have the coverage overlapped with that of an existing macrocell base-station (MBS). The design objective is to serve as many femto users (FUEs) as possible at their quality-of-service (QoS) requirements while maintaining the QoS requirements at the macro user (MUE). This paper then proposes three algorithmic schemes to perform multiuser admission control and beamforming optimization based on the levels of coordination between the MBS and FBSs. In Scheme I with full MBS-FBS coordination, a joint optimization framework is presented, and two solution approaches are proposed to determine the admission control and beamforming design for the FUEs in a centralized manner. In Scheme II with limited MBS-FBS coordination, a distributed algorithm that allows each FBS to unilaterally determine its admission control and beamforming strategy is proposed. This algorithm requires a certain coordination from the MBS by setting a limit on the amount of cross-tier intercell interference (ICI) that can be generated by each FBS. The convergence of the proposed distributed algorithm to a fixed point, where the QoS at the MUEs and the admitted FUEs is guaranteed, is then proved. Finally, in Scheme III without any MBS-FBS coordination, a joint multiuser admission control and zero-forcing beamforming design is then proposed. In particular, each FBS distributively admits its own FUEs while suppressing its cross-tier ICI to the MUEs, which effectively maintains the QoS at these MUEs. The simulation results show comparable performances between the distributed algorithms and the centralized ones in terms of the number of FUEs served and the network power usage.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "759", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "773", "date_publication": "Thu Jun 04 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15210751", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Jun 17 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "759 - 773", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Duy H.
