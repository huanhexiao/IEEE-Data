In the existing work, a power-aware mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is described by a Markov regenerative process, and takes account of the variability in power level, which is caused by the possible low-battery state in each communication node. However, it implicitly ignores effects by the so-called border effects, and lacks the reality in modeling. In this paper, we revisit a power-aware MANET model taking account of border effects and quantify the network survivability more accurately.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2665", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2676", "date_publication": "Wed Dec 09 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15656090", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 22 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2665 - 2676", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Zhipeng Yi", "Tadashi Dohi"], "keywords": ["Markov processes", "mobile ad hoc networks", "telecommunication network reliability", "telecommunication power management", "MANET", "Markov regenerative process", "border effects", "dependable computer networks", "network survivability", "power aware mobile ad hoc network", "power level variability", "survivability evaluation framework", "Batteries", "Computer crime", "Markov processes", "Mobile ad hoc networks", "Numerical models", "Routing", "DoS attack", "Network survivability", "battery charge", "border effects", "network connectivity", "network survivability", "power-aware MANET", "semi-Markov model", ""], "arnumber": "7350215"}
