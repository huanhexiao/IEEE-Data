Using a general mode-matching technique, the scattering matrix of waveguide bifurcation-type discontinuity and asymmetric iris are established and analyzed. Such discontinuities are used as coupling components and building blocks in the design of filters that are realized on RT/duroid 6002 with the ordinary printed circuit board process in our work. Measurement for one of the three four-pole filters gives 3.4 dB insertion loss and 17 dB return loss over the whole passband at near 24 GHz (K-band) with 440-MHz bandwidth (1.8%). The design method can be widely adopted for the development of microwave-integrated circuits, and the mass-fabrication of such SIW filters can be made easy while maintaining a very low cost.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1313", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1325", "date_publication": "Thu Jul 30 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15368827", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Aug 21 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1313 - 1325", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Yu Freeman Tang", "Ke Wu", "Nazih Khaddaj Mallat"], "keywords": ["Chebyshev filters", "S-matrix theory", "band-pass filters", "microwave circuits", "microwave filters", "radiofrequency integrated circuits", "substrate integrated waveguides", "waveguide filters", "Chebyshev response", "K-band", "RF circuit", "RT/duroid 6002", "SIW", "asymmetric iris", "bandwidth 440 MHz", "direct-coupled cavity bandpass filters", "frequency 24 GHz", "insertion loss", "loss 17 dB", "loss 3.4 dB", "microwave circuit", "microwave-integrated circuits", "mode-matching technique", "printed circuit board", "scattering matrix", "substrate-integrated waveguide filters", "waveguide bifurcation-type discontinuity", "Band-pass filters", "Chebyshev response function", "Conductors", "Loss measurement", "Substrates", "Chebyshev response function", "Substrate Integrated Waveguide (SIW)", "Substrate integrated waveguide (SIW)", "band-pass filter", "conductor loss", "dielectric loss", "filter, Chebyshev response function", ""], "arnumber": "7173006"}
