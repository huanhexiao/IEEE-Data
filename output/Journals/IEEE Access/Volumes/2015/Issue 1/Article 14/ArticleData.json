This promising trend introduces the unplanned deployment of smaller base stations (BSs), thus complicating the performance evaluation even further. In this paper, based on large amount of real BS locations data, we present a comprehensive analysis on the spatial modeling of a cellular network structure. Unlike the related works, we divide the BSs into different subsets according to geographical factor (e.g., urban or rural) and functional type (e.g., macrocells or microcells), and perform a detailed spatial analysis to each subset. After discovering the inaccuracy of the Poisson point process in BS locations modeling, we consider the Gibbs point processes as well as Neyman-Scott point processes and compare their performance in the view of a large-scale modeling test, and finally reveal the general clustering nature of BSs deployment. This paper carries out the first large-scale identification regarding available literature, and provides more realistic and general results to contribute to the performance analysis for the forthcoming heterogeneous cellular networks.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2987", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2999", "date_publication": "Thu Dec 17 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15673502", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 06 00:00:00 EST 2016", "pages": "2987 - 2999", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Yifan Zhou", "Zhifeng Zhao", "Yves Lou\u00ebt", "Qianlan Ying", "Rongpeng Li", "Xuan Zhou", "Xianfu Chen", "Honggang Zhang"], "keywords": ["cellular radio", "stochastic processes", "telecommunication network topology", "BS location modeling", "Gibbs point process", "Neyman-Scott point process", "Poisson point process", "cellular network topology", "geographical factor", "heterogeneous evolution", "large-scale spatial distribution identification", "smaller base station performance evaluation", "spatial analysis", "Base stations", "Data models", "Macrocell networks", "Measurement", "Microcell networks", "Urban areas", "Cellular networks", "Poisson point process", "base station (BS) locations", "large-scale identification", "stochastic geometry", ""], "arnumber": "7355273"}
