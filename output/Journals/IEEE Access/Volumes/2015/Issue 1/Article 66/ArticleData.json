This paper deals with the integration between the electromobility and the urban power distribution network in a smart grid framework, i.e., a multi-stakeholder and multi-Internet ecosystem (Internet of Information, Internet of Energy, and Internet of Things) with edge computing capabilities supported by cloud-level services and with clean mapping between the logical and physical entities involved and their stakeholders. In particular, this paper presents some of the results obtained by us in several European projects that refer to the development of a traffic and power network co-simulation tool for electro mobility planning, platforms for recharging services, and communication and service management architectures supporting interoperability and other qualities required for the implementation of the smart grid framework. For each contribution, this paper describes the inter-disciplinary characteristics of the proposed approaches.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2281", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2305", "date_publication": "Thu Nov 12 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15591468", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Nov 20 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2281 - 2305", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Alfredo D\u2019Elia", "Fabio Viola", "Federico Montori", "Marco Di Felice", "Luca Bedogni", "Luciano Bononi", "Alberto Borghetti", "Paolo Azzoni", "Paolo Bellavista", "Daniele Tarchi", "Randolf Mock", "Tullio Salmon Cinotti"], "keywords": ["Internet", "cloud computing", "open systems", "power engineering computing", "smart power grids", "European projects", "cloud-level services", "electromobility", "electromobility planning", "fossil fuel mining industry", "interoperability", "multi-Internet ecosystem", "service management architectures", "smart grid extension", "urban power distribution network", "Cloud computing", "Energy storage", "Information management", "Smart grids", "Urban areas", "Electro Mobility", "Internet of Things", "Service infrastructure", "Smart grid", "arrowhead", "co-simulation", "electro mobility", "power distribution", "service infrastructure", ""], "arnumber": "7328250"}
