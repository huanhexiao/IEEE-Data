Several research studies have shown that power consumption patterns can reveal a range of information about consumers, such as how many people are in the home, the types of appliances they use, their eating and sleeping routines, and even the TV programs they watch. As we move toward liberalized energy markets, many different parties are interested in gaining access to such data, which has enormous economical, societal, and environmental benefits. However, the main concern is that many such beneficial uses of smart meter big data would be severely curtailed if the data were excessively protected due to individuals' privacy. In this paper, we propose a game theoretic mechanism that balances between beneficial uses of data and individuals' privacy in deregulated smart grids. Our mechanism solves the problem of access control by fairly compensating consumers for their participation in the data market based on the concept of differential privacy. The results of our experiments show the importance of taking consumers' attitudes toward privacy as a crucial element in designing balanced markets for fair data sharing. Furthermore, the experiments provide a principled way to choose reasonable values for privacy levels that are more relevant to real-world scenarios.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2743", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2754", "date_publication": "Tue Dec 01 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15656094", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 29 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2743 - 2754", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Abdulsalam Yassine", "Ali Asghar Nazari Shirehjini", "Shervin Shirmohammadi"], "keywords": ["Big Data", "authorisation", "data privacy", "game theory", "power consumption", "power engineering computing", "power markets", "smart meters", "smart power grids", "access control problem", "consumer power consumption patterns", "data privacy", "deregulated smart grids", "differential privacy", "fair data sharing", "fine-granular data measurement aggregation", "game theoretic model", "liberalized energy markets", "smart meter Big Data", "Big data", "Data privacy", "Games", "Power demand", "Privacy", "Smart grids", "Smart meters", "Big Data", "Game theory", "Privacy", "Smart Grid", "Smart Metering", "Smart metering", "big data", "game theory", "privacy", "smart grid", ""], "arnumber": "7342880"}
