When combined with advanced cloud infrastructures, they bring to life a novel paradigm of heterogeneous cloud radio access network (H-CRAN). The novel H-CRAN architecture opens door to improved network-wide management, including coordinated cross-cell radio resource allocation. In this paper, emphasizing the lack of theoretical performance analysis, we specifically address the problem of cooperative radio resource management in H-CRAN by providing a comprehensive mathematical methodology for its real-time performance optimization. Our approach enables flexible balance between throughput and fairness metrics, as may be desired by the network operator, and demonstrates attractive benefits when compared against the state-of-the-art multiradio resource allocation strategies. The resulting algorithms are suitable for efficient online implementation, which principal feasibility is confirmed by our proof-of-concept prototype.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "397", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "406", "date_publication": "Mon Apr 13 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15095451", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue May 05 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "397 - 406", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Mikhail Gerasimenko", "Dmitri Moltchanov", "Roman Florea", "Sergey Andreev", "Yevgeni Koucheryavy", "Nageen Himayat", "Shu-Ping Yeh", "Shilpa Talwar"], "keywords": ["5G mobile communication", "cloud computing", "cooperative communication", "optimisation", "radio access networks", "resource allocation", "telecommunication network management", "5G communications ecosystem", "H-CRAN", "advanced cloud infrastructures", "cooperative radio resource management", "coordinated cross-cell radio resource allocation", "heterogeneous cloud radio access network", "heterogeneous network architectures", "multiple radio access technologies", "network-wide management", "real-time performance optimization", "5G mobile communication", "Cloud computing", "Heterogeneous networks", "Mathematical model", "Prototypes", "Radio access networks", "Radio commuincation", "Resource management", "Heterogeneous network", "cloud infrastructure", "cooperative radio resource management", "heterogeneous cloud radio access network", "mathematical methodology", "prototyping", ""], "arnumber": "7084578"}
