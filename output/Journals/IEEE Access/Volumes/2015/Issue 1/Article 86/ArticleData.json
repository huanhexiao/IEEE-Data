Unlike the conventional WET-enabled frame transmission schemes, with the aid of SP, both the uplink (UL) channel estimation and wireless information transmission (WIT) that powered by the downlink (DL) WET can be operated simultaneously, and thus provide the potential for improving the UL achievable throughput. The impact that the SP has on the performance of such a WET-enabled massive MIMO system is mathematically characterized, and the optimal solution, including the SP power-allocation and the ratio of time-allocation between the duration of UL WIT and DL WET, is derived with regard to maximize the UL achievable throughput. Numerical results demonstrate the proposed SP-aided WET technique yields a superior performance than the conventional pilot-only-based schemes.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2014", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2027", "date_publication": "Mon Oct 26 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15560307", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Oct 30 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "2014 - 2027", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Jiaming Li", "Han Zhang", "Dong Li", "Hongbin Chen"], "keywords": ["MIMO communication", "channel estimation", "radiofrequency power transmission", "DL WET", "SP power-allocation", "UL WIT", "WET-enabled massive MIMO system", "downlink channel", "massive multiple-input multiple-output system", "superimposed pilot-aided channel estimation", "uplink channel estimation", "wireless energy transfer", "wireless information transmission", "Channel estimation", "Energy harvesting", "Energy transfer", "MIMO", "Power distribution", "Throughput", "Wireless communication", "Energy harvesting", "channel estimation", "massive MIMO", "throughput maximization", "wireless information and power transfer", ""], "arnumber": "7302523"}
