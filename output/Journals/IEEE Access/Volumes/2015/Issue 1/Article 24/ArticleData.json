This poses a limit on the accuracy and the quality of prediction. In this paper, we utilize secondary information pertaining to user's demography and item categories to enhance prediction accuracy. Within the matrix factorization framework, we introduce additional supervised label consistency terms that match the user and item factor matrices to the available secondary information (metadata). Matrix factorization model-conventionally employed in collaborative filtering techniques-yields dense user and dense item factor matrices-the assumption is that users have an affinity toward all latent factors and items possess all latent factors. Our formulation, based on a recent work, aims to recover a dense user and a sparse item factor matrix-this is a more reasonable model. Human beings show a natural interest toward all the factors, but every item cannot possess all the factors; this leads to a sparse item factor matrix. A natural outcome of our proposal is a solution to the pure cold start problem. We utilize the label consistency map generated from the proposed model to make reasonable recommendations for new users and new items which have not (been) rated yet. We demonstrate the performance of our model for a movie recommendation system. We also design an efficient algorithm for our formulation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2803", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2813", "date_publication": "Mon Dec 21 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15656096", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Dec 31 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2803 - 2813", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Anupriya Gogna", "Angshul Majumdar"], "keywords": ["collaborative filtering", "matrix decomposition", "recommender systems", "sparse matrices", "cold start users", "collaborative filtering techniques", "comprehensive recommender system model", "label consistency map", "matrix factorization framework", "movie recommendation system", "sparse item factor matrix", "supervised label consistency terms", "warm start users", "Collaboration", "Databases", "Metadata", "Recommender systems", "Sparse matrices", "Supervised learning", "Auxiliary information", "blind compressive sensing", "cold start", "latent factor model", "matrix factorization", ""], "arnumber": "7361739"}
