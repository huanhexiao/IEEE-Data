Since there is no central controller and information exchange, it encounters dynamic and incomplete information constraints. To solve this challenge, we formulate a state-based spectrum access game and a robust spectrum access game. It is proved that the two games are ordinal potential games with the (expected) aggregate weighted interference serving as the potential functions. A distributed learning algorithm is proposed to achieve the pure strategy Nash equilibrium (NE) of the games. It is shown that the best NE is almost the same with the optimal solution and the achievable throughput of the proposed learning algorithm is very close to the optimal one, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed game-theoretic solution.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1071", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1078", "date_publication": "Wed Jul 08 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15314324", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Jul 28 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1071 - 1078", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Yuhua Xu", "Yitao Xu", "Alagan Anpalagan"], "keywords": ["game theory", "learning (artificial intelligence)", "radio networks", "radio spectrum management", "telecommunication computing", "white noise", "NE strategy", "Nash equilibrium", "database-assisted spectrum access problem", "distributed learning algorithm", "dynamic TV white spectrum network", "robust spectrum access game", "state-based spectrum access game", "weighted interference", "Learning automata", "Learning systems", "Mobile radio mobility management", "Spread spectrum management", "TV", "White space", "TV white spectrum", "geo-location database", "learning automata", "ordinal potential game", ""], "arnumber": "7152835"}
