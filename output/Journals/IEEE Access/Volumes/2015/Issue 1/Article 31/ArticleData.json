The proposed FD cognitive MAC (FDC-MAC) protocol does not require synchronization among SUs, and it efficiently utilizes the spectrum and mitigates the self-interference in the FD transceiver. We develop a mathematical model to analyze the throughput performance of the FDC-MAC protocol, where both half-duplex (HD) transmission and FD transmission modes are considered in the transmission stage. Then, we study the FDC-MAC configuration optimization through adaptively controlling the spectrum sensing duration and transmit power level in the FD sensing stage. We prove that there exists optimal sensing time and transmit power to achieve the maximum throughput, and we develop an algorithm to configure the proposed FDC-MAC protocol. Extensive numerical results are presented to illustrate the optimal FDC-MAC configuration and the impacts of protocol parameters and the self-interference cancellation quality on the throughput performance. Moreover, we demonstrate the significant throughput gains of the FDC-MAC protocol with respect to the existing HD MAC and single-stage FD MAC protocols.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2715", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2729", "date_publication": "Thu Dec 17 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15656099", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 29 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2715 - 2729", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Le Thanh Tan", "Long Bao Le"], "keywords": ["access protocols", "cognitive radio", "interference suppression", "radio networks", "radio spectrum management", "signal detection", "FD SUs", "FD transceiver", "FD transmission modes", "FDC-MAC configuration optimization", "FDC-MAC protocol", "adaptive medium access control protocol", "channel contention", "full-duplex MAC protocol", "full-duplex cognitive radio networks", "half-duplex transmission", "mathematical model", "secondary users", "self-interference mitigation", "spectrum sensing duration", "transmit power level", "High definition video", "Media Access Protocol", "Sensors", "Standards", "Throughput", "White spaces", "Asynchronous MAC", "full-duplex MAC", "full-duplex cognitive radios", "full-duplex spectrum sensing", "fullduplex spectrum sensing", "optimal sensing duration", "self-interference control", "throughput analysis", "throughput maximization", ""], "arnumber": "7359104"}
