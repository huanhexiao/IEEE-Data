With the aid of APT malware, attackers can remotely control infected machines and steal sensitive information. DNS is popular for malware to locate command and control (C&C) servers. In this paper, we propose a novel system placed at the network egress point that aims to efficiently and effectively detect APT malware infections based on malicious DNS and traffic analysis. The system uses malicious DNS analysis techniques to detect suspicious APT malware C&C domains, and then analyzes the traffic of the corresponding suspicious IP using the signature-based and anomaly based detection technology. We extracted 14 features based on big data to characterize different properties of malware-related DNS and the ways that they are queried, and we also defined network traffic features that can identify the traffic of compromised clients that have remotely been controlled. We built a reputation engine to compute a reputation score for an IP address using these features vector together. Our experiment was performed at a large local institute network for two months, and all the features were studied with big data, which includes ~400 million DNS queries. Our security approach cannot only substantially reduce the volume of network traffic that needs to be recorded and analyzed but also improve the sustainability of the system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1132", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1142", "date_publication": "Mon Jul 20 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15352003", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 03 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1132 - 1142", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["G.
