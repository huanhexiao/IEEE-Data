We do this by describing a low-cost front-end that can be used in combination with any baseband processing platform. We provide detailed instructions and software for connection with the USRP N200/N210, including general classes for controlling the board and example single-input single-output and 2 \u00d7 2 Multiple-Input Multiple Output applications. In addition, we provide measurements to assess the impact of phase noise and other hardware impairments in low-cost millimeter-wave systems for hybrid measurement and simulation studies. Finally, we also perform performance measurements on the hardware. All our materials, such as the hardware design, the software, and the measurements, are freely available.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "445", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "456", "date_publication": "Mon Mar 30 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15095458", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Wed May 06 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "445 - 456", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Per Zetterberg", "Ramin Fardi"], "keywords": ["MIMO communication", "phase noise", "software radio", "USRP N200-N210", "baseband processing platform", "frequency 60 GHz", "hardware design", "hardware impairments", "hybrid measurement", "low-cost millimeter-wave systems", "multiple-input multiple-output application", "open source SDR frontend", "phase noise impact", "single-input single-output application", "wireless experimentation", "Noise measurement", "OFDM", "Optical fiber communication", "Wavelength division multiplexing", "Wireless communication", "Rayleigh backscattering", "WDM", "Wireless", "colorless ONU", ""], "arnumber": "7072470"}
