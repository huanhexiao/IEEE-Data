In this paper, a new enriched Co-based composition is proposed for dental application, starting from a conventional CoCrMo alloy. Macrostructural and microstructural investigations, mechanical and corrosion resistance evaluation, and metal ions release are carried out. The best composition, among the studied alloys, is identified for dental purpose.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "73", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "80", "date_publication": "Thu Feb 05 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14945589", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Feb 25 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "73 - 80", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Ildiko Peter", "Mario Rosso"], "keywords": ["biomedical materials", "chromium alloys", "cobalt alloys", "corrosion resistance", "crystal microstructure", "dentistry", "ductility", "molybdenum alloys", "titanium alloys", "CoCrMoTi", "corrosion resistance", "dental application", "macrostructural investigation", "mechanical evaluation", "medical device production", "metallic materials", "microstructural investigation", "Alloys", "Biomedical materials", "Dentistry", "Immune system", "Implants", "Medical treatment", "Metals", "CoCrMo alloy", "Metallic materials", "biomedical application", "microstructure", "residual stress", ""], "arnumber": "7031856"}
