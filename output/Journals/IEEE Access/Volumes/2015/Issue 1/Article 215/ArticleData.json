In particular, we consider the application of bipedal walking and show that our method [based on a quadratic programming (QP) implementation of a control Lyapunov function (CLF)-based controller] enables a gradual performance degradation while still continuing to walk under increasingly stringent input bounds. We draw on our previous work, which has demonstrated the effectiveness of the CLF-based controllers for stabilizing periodic gaits for biped walkers. This paper presents a framework, which results in more effective handling of control saturations and provides a means for incorporating a whole family of user-defined constraints into the online computation of a CLF-based controller. This paper concludes with an experimental validation of the main results on the bipedal robot MABEL, demonstrating the usefulness of the QP-based CLF approach for real-time robotic control.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "323", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "332", "date_publication": "Fri Apr 03 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15087880", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 27 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "323 - 332", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Kevin Galloway", "Koushil Sreenath", "Aaron D.
