Single-mode access, combined with static spectrum partitioning between co-deployed RATs and independent resource allocation for employed RATs, results in suboptimal spectrum utilization in multi-RAT systems. This paper models user access in multi-RAT systems and proposes enabling multi-mode UE to simultaneously utilize multiple RATs, using multi-RAT carrier aggregation, to improve the performance and spectrum utilization of multi-RAT systems. Several realizations of multi-mode access with varying implementation requirements are presented and discussed. Detailed system-level simulations, for a system co-deploying High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) and Long-Term Evolution (LTE), are performed to investigate the gains and limitations of different user access configurations in multi-RAT systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "787", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "792", "date_publication": "Wed Jun 03 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15210752", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 19 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "787 - 792", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Ahmed Alsohaily", "Elvino S.
