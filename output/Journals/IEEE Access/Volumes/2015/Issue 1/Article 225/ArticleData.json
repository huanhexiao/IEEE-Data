Partly due to the advent of compressive sensing, methods that can optimally exploit sparsity in signals have received tremendous attention in recent years. In this paper, we will describe a variety of scenarios in which signal sparsity arises naturally in 5G wireless systems. Signal sparsity and the associated rich collection of tools and algorithms will thus be a viable source for innovation in 5G wireless system design. We will also describe applications of this sparse signal processing paradigm in Multiple Input Multiple Output random access, cloud radio access networks, compressive channel-source network coding, and embedded security. We will also emphasize an important open problem that may arise in 5G system design, for which sparsity will potentially play a key role in their solution.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "195", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "208", "date_publication": "Tue Feb 24 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15018711", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 31 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "195 - 208", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Gerhard Wunder", "Holger Boche", "Thomas Strohmer", "Peter Jung"], "keywords": ["5G mobile communication", "MIMO communication", "combined source-channel coding", "compressed sensing", "network coding", "radio access networks", "random processes", "5G wireless system design", "MIMO random access", "cloud radio access networks", "compressive channel-source network coding", "compressive sensing", "embedded security", "multiple input multiple output", "signal sparsity", "sparse signal processing", "4G mobile communication", "5G mobile communication", "Compressed sensing", "Mobile communication", "Network security", "Signal processing", "Sparse matrices", "Wireless communication", "Cloud Radio Acess Networks", "Compressed Sensing", "Compressed sensing", "Massive Random Access", "cloud radio acess networks", "embedded security", "massive random access", "source coding", ""], "arnumber": "7047686"}
