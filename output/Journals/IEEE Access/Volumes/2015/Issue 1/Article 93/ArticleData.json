We use a standard approach for predicting the load in the next 10 min, while, for a forecast horizon of one day, we represent the data with a high-dimensional multi-variate TS, where the number of variables is equivalent to the quantity of measurements registered in a day. Through the orthogonal transformation returned by PCA decomposition, we reduce the dimensionality of the TS to a lower number k of distinct variables; this allows us to cast the original prediction problem in k different one-step ahead predictions. The overall forecast can be effectively managed by k distinct prediction models, whose outputs are combined together to obtain the final result. We employ a genetic algorithm for tuning the parameters of the ESN and compare its prediction accuracy with a standard autoregressive integrated moving average model.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1931", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1943", "date_publication": "Thu Oct 01 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15543321", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Oct 28 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1931 - 1943", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Filippo Maria Bianchi", "Enrico De Santis", "Antonello Rizzi", "Alireza Sadeghian"], "keywords": ["distribution networks", "load forecasting", "power grids", "principal component analysis", "time series", "ACEA power grid", "Azienda Comunale Energia e Ambiente", "ESN", "Italy", "PCA decomposition", "Rome", "autoregressive integrated moving average model", "echo state networks", "electric load forecasting", "electricity distribution", "time series", "Forecasting", "Genetic algorithms", "Load management", "Predictive models", "Smart grids", "Time series analysis", "Dimensionality Reduction", "Echo State Network", "Electric Load Prediction", "Forecasting", "Genetic Algorithm", "PCA", "Smart Grid", "Time-Series", "Time-series", "dimensionality reduction", "echo state network", "electric load prediction", "forecasting", "genetic algorithm", "smart grid", ""], "arnumber": "7286732"}
