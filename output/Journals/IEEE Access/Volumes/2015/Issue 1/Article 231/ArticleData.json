After a brief historical background, we review the developments in power sources in the decades following the pioneering works of Zworykin and Mackay in the late 1950s. These include deployment of lithium batteries and inductive powering in the 1970s, which resulted in significant growth and commercialization of implantable medical devices, such as cardiac pacemakers and cochlear implants. Recent research in nanoscale materials for energy generation has created intriguing possibilities for next generation implantable power sources in the form of flexible and biodegradable batteries and supercapacitors. In addition, energy harvesting/remote powering from various environmental physical and chemical sources within the body utilizing nanoscale materials can also offer unique possibilities for autonomous implantable microscale and nanoscale devices.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "89", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "98", "date_publication": "Mon Feb 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14961902", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 03 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "89 - 98", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Albert Kim", "Manuel Ochoa", "Rahim Rahimi", "Babak Ziaie"], "keywords": ["biodegradable materials", "cochlear implants", "energy resources", "lithium", "micromechanical devices", "nanobiotechnology", "nanostructured materials", "pacemakers", "secondary cells", "supercapacitors", "biodegradable batteries", "cardiac pacemakers", "chemical sources", "cochlear implants", "energy generation", "energy harvesting", "energy sources", "environmental physical sources", "flexible batteries", "implantable medical devices", "implantable wireless microdevices", "inductive powering", "lithium batteries", "nanoscale materials", "power sources", "remote powering", "review", "supercapacitors", "Biomedical equipment", "Energy efficiency", "Flexible electronics", "Implants", "Inductive powering", "Medical devices", "Wireless communication", "Flexible electronics", "Implantable biomedical devices", "Implantable microdevices", "Inductive powering", "biodegradable electronics", "energy scavenging", "flexible batteries", "flexible bioelectronics", "flexible super-capacitors", "nanomaterials", ""], "arnumber": "7047228"}
