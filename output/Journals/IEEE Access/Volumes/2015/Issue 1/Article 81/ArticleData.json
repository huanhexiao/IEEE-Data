These interactions and integration aspects are essential when studying a system and subsystem behavior. This is especially important when considering fault scenarios,s harsh weather, and complex marine operations. However, many simulators, including a selection presented here, study the positioning system and the power system separately. This paper proposes a simulator combining the two systems, as an extension to the marine systems simulator MATLAB/Simulink library. The intended use cases and the according design choices are presented. New subsystem models include a power-based electrical bus model and a simplified diesel engine model. Both are validated through the simulation against established models. In addition, established models for generators, electrical storage devices, thrusters, and a mean-value diesel engine model are summarized with rich references. Three case studies illustrate the multi-domain use of the simulator: 1) a semi-submersible drilling rig performing station keeping under environmental disturbances; 2) the same vessel subject to an electrical bus reconfiguration; and 3) a supply vessel with a hybrid power plant.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2065", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2079", "date_publication": "Fri Oct 30 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15576555", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 09 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2065 - 2079", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Torstein I.
