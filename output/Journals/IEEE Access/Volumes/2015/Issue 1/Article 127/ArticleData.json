This paper presents an efficient method to measure the volume of a large conducting cavity. The proposed method is based on statistical wave theory. By measuring the Q factor in the time and frequency domains, the volume of the cavity can be extracted. In the time domain, the Q factor can be extracted directly from the time domain response, while in the frequency domain, the Q factor depends on the volume of the cavity and the transferred power; the transferred power can be measured directly. By correcting the frequency domain Q with the radiation efficiency of antennas, the Q factors obtained from both the time and frequency domains are equal in a well-stirred chamber; this provides an opportunity to measure the volume of the cavity. Measurements are conducted to verify the proposed method. Although the measurement is conducted using electromagnetic waves, acoustic waves can also be used; in this case, the approach can be applied to any cavity, not limited to a conducting cavity. The advantages and the limitations of the proposed method are also discussed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1555", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1561", "date_publication": "Thu Sep 03 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15422974", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 11 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1555 - 1561", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Qian Xu", "Yi Huang", "Lei Xing", "Zhihao Tian", "Zhouxiang Fei", "Liuji Zheng"], "keywords": ["Q-factor measurement", "antenna radiation patterns", "electromagnetic devices", "electromagnetic wave propagation", "reverberation chambers", "statistical analysis", "time-frequency analysis", "volume measurement", "Q factor measurement", "antenna radiation efficiency", "conducting cavity volume measurement", "frequency-domain analysis", "statistical wave theory", "time-domain analysis", "transfer power measurement", "well-stirred chamber", "Acoustic measurements", "Antenna measurements", "Calibration", "Cavity resonators", "Electromagnetics", "Q-factor", "Statistical analysis", "Volume measurement", "Cavity volume measurement", "cavity volume measurement", "statistical acoustics", "statistical electromagnetics", ""], "arnumber": "7239516"}
