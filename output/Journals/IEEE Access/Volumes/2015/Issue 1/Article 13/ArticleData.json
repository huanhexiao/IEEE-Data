In order to obtain accurate channel realizations, the ray tracing (RT) software is calibrated on both the power delay profile and the path levels. For the measurement data, the propagation paths are identified using the non-parametric peak detection algorithm. The cluster-alike behaviors of these paths and the influence of the antenna radiation pattern are also studied through the comparison with the RT simulated paths. Subsequently, the evolutionary traces of channel with regard to the user equipment's movement are identified by associating the samples, which have the similar parameters at adjacent locations. The features of these traces are analyzed in both statistical and individual ways. Results show that the life durations of most traces are within 5 m. The line of sight and reflected paths with significant power survive longer than the others. These observations confirm the feasibility of designing adaptive beam tracking algorithms based on the spatial consistency of the dominant propagation paths. Moreover, high correlations among the variations of different parameters in the same trace are revealed.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2950", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2958", "date_publication": "Fri Dec 18 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15707864", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 07 00:00:00 EST 2016", "pages": "2950 - 2958", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Nan Zhang", "Jianwu Dou", "Li Tian", "Xi Yuan", "Xiaoyi Yang", "Suping Mei", "Haiming Wang"], "keywords": ["antenna radiation patterns", "indoor radio", "microwave antennas", "microwave propagation", "ray tracing", "statistical analysis", "wireless channels", "RT software", "adaptive beam tracking algorithm", "antenna radiation pattern", "dominant propagation path spatial consistency", "dynamic channel modeling", "frequency 23.5 GHz", "indoor scenario", "nonparametric peak detection algorithm", "power delay profile", "ray tracing software", "Antenna measurements", "Antenna radiation patterns", "Beam tracking", "Channel modeling", "Delays", "Frequency measurement", "Horn antennas", "Indoor communication", "Scattering", "23.5 GHz", "23:5 GHz", "beam tracking", "dynamic channel modeling", "life duration of trace", "spatial consistency", ""], "arnumber": "7360880"}
