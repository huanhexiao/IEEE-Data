As a part of array signal processing, direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation is of vital importance to obtain directional information of sources and to enable the 3-D beamforming. In this paper, the performance of DoA estimation for massive MIMO systems is analyzed and compared using a low complexity algorithm. To be specific, 2-D unitary estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (U-ESPRIT) algorithm is studied to jointly estimate elevation and azimuth information, and uniform rectangular array is selected to represent massive MIMO systems. The simulation results indicate that the U-ESPRIT algorithm works well for the massive MIMO systems. The performance has been evaluated with various types of antenna configuration and source numbers. Finally, the array resolution is adopted to analyze the performance of elevation and azimuth estimation and how to choose the appropriate antenna array configuration.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2122", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2128", "date_publication": "Mon Nov 02 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15638743", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 12 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2122 - 2128", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Ting Wang", "Bo Ai", "Ruisi He", "Zhangdui Zhong"], "keywords": ["MIMO communication", "antenna arrays", "array signal processing", "direction-of-arrival estimation", "2D unitary estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques", "3D beamforming", "DoA estimation", "U-ESPRIT algorithm", "antenna array configuration", "array signal processing", "azimuth information", "elevation information", "low complexity algorithm", "massive MIMO systems", "multiple-input multiple-output systems", "network capacity", "source numbers", "two-dimension direction-of-arrival estimation", "uniform rectangular array", "wireless communication networks", "Array resolution", "Direction-of-arrival estimation", "MIMO", "Two-dimensional displays", "Array Resolution", "DoA estimation", "Massive MIMO", "Unitary ESPRIT", "array resolution", "massive MIMO", "unitary ESPRIT", ""], "arnumber": "7314866"}
