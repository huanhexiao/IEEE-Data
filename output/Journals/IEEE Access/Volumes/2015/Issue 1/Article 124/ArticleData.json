We specifically consider legacy communication systems as opposed to cooperative communication systems to address the ever present problem of legacy technologies. This radar waveform is able to share the spectrum with the existing communication systems such that its detection performance is not compromised while trying to help the legacy systems maintain their own symbol error rates (SERs). We show with various scenarios that the spectrally shaped radar waveform outperforms the traditional wideband pulse waveform in terms of detection performance with the communication signals acting as interference to the radar. Moreover, SERs of the legacy systems employing quaternary phase-shift keying modulation in the presence of the shaped radar waveform (acting as interference) outperform SERs of systems under traditional radar pulse interference. These SERs are very close to theoretical noise-only SERs.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1541", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1554", "date_publication": "Wed Aug 26 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15443730", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Sep 14 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1541 - 1554", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Ric A.
