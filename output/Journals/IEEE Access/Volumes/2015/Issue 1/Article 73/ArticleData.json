Deep learning approaches pose a unique challenge: while such architectures dominate the field of face recognition with regard to accuracy, they require elaborate, multi-stage computations. Recently, there has been some work on compressing networks for the purpose of reducing run time and network size. However, it is not clear that these compression methods would work in deep face nets, which are, generally speaking, less redundant than the object recognition networks, i.e., they are already relatively lean. We propose two novel methods for compression: one based on eliminating lowly active channels and the other on coupling pruning with repeated use of already computed elements. Pruning of entire channels is an appealing idea, since it leads to direct saving in run time in almost every reasonable architecture.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2163", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2175", "date_publication": "Mon Oct 26 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15591464", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Nov 18 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2163 - 2175", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Adam Polyak", "Lior Wolf"], "keywords": ["biometrics (access control)", "data compression", "face recognition", "image coding", "image representation", "learning (artificial intelligence)", "object recognition", "biometrics", "channel-level acceleration", "compression methods", "deep face representations", "deep learning approach", "face recognition", "object recognition networks", "Biometrics", "Face recognition", "Image compression", "Resource management", "Face recognition", "neural network compression", ""], "arnumber": "7303876"}
