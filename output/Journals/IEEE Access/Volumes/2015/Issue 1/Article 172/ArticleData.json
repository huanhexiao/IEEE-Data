Due to the nature and envisaged battery-operated long-life operation of MTC devices without human intervention, energy efficiency becomes extremely important. This paper elaborates the state-of-the-art approaches toward addressing the challenge in relation to the low energy consumption operation of MTC devices, and proposes a novel RRC protocol design, namely, semi-persistent RRC state transition (SPRST), where the RRC state transition is no longer triggered by incoming traffic but depends on pre-determined parameters based on the traffic pattern obtained by exploiting the network memory. The proposed RRC protocol can easily co-exist with the legacy RRC protocol in the LTE. The design criterion of SPRST is derived and the signalling procedure is investigated accordingly. Based upon the simulation results, it is shown that the SPRST significantly reduces both the energy consumption and the signalling overhead while at the same time guarantees the quality of service requirements.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "864", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "874", "date_publication": "Tue Jun 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15228050", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 26 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "864 - 874", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Yinan Qi", "Atta Ul Quddus", "Muhammad Ali Imran", "Rahim Tafazolli"], "keywords": ["3G mobile communication", "Internet of Things", "Long Term Evolution", "energy conservation", "energy consumption", "protocols", "quality of service", "telecommunication traffic", "3rd generation partnership project", "Internet of Things", "LTE networks", "Long-Term Evolution", "MTC devices", "SPRST design criterion", "battery-operated long-life operation", "energy efficiency", "low energy consumption machine-type communication devices", "network memory", "quality of service", "radio resource control protocol", "semipersistent RRC protocol design", "semipersistent RRC state transition", "signalling overhead", "traffic pattern", "3G mobile communication", "Complexity theory", "Energy efficiency", "Internet of things", "Long Term Evolution", "Machine-to-machine communications", "Quality of service", "Radio communciation", "Resource management", "3GPP", "Discontinuous reception (DRX)", "LTE", "Machine Type Communication (MTC)", "Radio Resource Control (RRC)", "discontinuous reception (DRX)", "machine type communication (MTC)", "radio resource control (RRC)", ""], "arnumber": "7124407"}
