The proposed approach develops around the systematic application of advanced machine learning techniques and, in particular, unsupervised deep learning and probabilistic generative models for system-wide learning, modeling, optimization, and data representation. Moreover, in COBANETS, we propose to combine this learning architecture with the emerging network virtualization paradigms, which make it possible to actuate automatic optimization and reconfiguration strategies at the system level, thus fully unleashing the potential of the learning approach. Compared with the past and current research efforts in this area, the technical approach outlined in this paper is deeply interdisciplinary and more comprehensive, calling for the synergic combination of expertise of computer scientists, communications and networking engineers, and cognitive scientists, with the ultimate aim of breaking new ground through a profound rethinking of how the modern understanding of cognition can be used in the management and optimization of telecommunication networks.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1512", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1530", "date_publication": "Fri Aug 21 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15462543", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Sep 14 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1512 - 1530", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Michele Zorzi", "Andrea Zanella", "Alberto Testolin", "Michele De Filippo De Grazia", "Marco Zorzi"], "keywords": ["cognitive radio", "data structures", "learning (artificial intelligence)", "telecommunication computing", "COBANET", "automatic optimization", "cognition-based network", "cognitive network", "data representation", "machine learning technique", "network optimization", "network virtualization paradigm", "probabilistic generative model", "reconfiguration strategy", "system-wide learning", "system-wide modeling", "system-wide optimization", "unsupervised deep learning", "Cognitive networks", "Communication networks", "Deep learning", "Hierarchical networks", "Optimization", "Cognitive networks", "deep learning", "hierarchical generative models", "optimization", ""], "arnumber": "7217798"}
