As one of the key members of IoT, Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has seen steep advancement in communication technologies. Now, vehicles can easily exchange safety, efficiency, infotainment, and comfort-related information with other vehicles and infrastructures using vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). We leverage on the cloud-based VANETs theme to propose cyber-physical architecture for the Social IoV (SIoV). SIoV is a vehicular instance of the Social IoT (SIoT), where vehicles are the key social entities in the machine-to-machine vehicular social networks. We have identified the social structures of SIoV components, their relationships, and the interaction types. We have mapped VANETs components into IoT-A architecture reference model to offer better integration of SIoV with other IoT domains. We also present a communication message structure based on automotive ontologies, the SAE J2735 message set, and the advanced traveler information system events schema that corresponds to the social graph. Finally, we provide the implementation details and the experimental analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed system as well as include different application scenarios for various user groups.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "343", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "357", "date_publication": "Wed Mar 25 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15087881", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 27 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "343 - 357", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Kazi Masudul Alam", "Mukesh Saini", "Abdulmotaleb El Saddik"], "keywords": ["Internet of Things", "cloud computing", "graph theory", "ontologies (artificial intelligence)", "social networking (online)", "traffic information systems", "vehicular ad hoc networks", "Internet of Things", "IoT-A architecture reference model", "SAE J2735 message set", "SIoT", "SIoV", "automotive ontologies", "cloud-based VANET theme", "communication message structure", "cyber-physical architecture", "machine-to-machine vehicular social networks", "social Internet of Vehicles", "social IoT", "social IoV", "social graph", "traveler information system event schema", "vehicular ad hoc networks", "Ad hoc networks", "Computer architecture", "Intelligent vehicles", "Internet of things", "Social network services", "Vehicles", "Cyber-Physical Systems", "Cyber-physical systems", "Intelligent Transport Systems", "Intelligent transport systems", "Internet of Things", "Internet of Vehicles", "IoT Architecture Reference Model", "IoT architecture reference model", "SAE J2735", "Social Network of Vehicles", "Social network of vehicles", ""], "arnumber": "7067363"}
