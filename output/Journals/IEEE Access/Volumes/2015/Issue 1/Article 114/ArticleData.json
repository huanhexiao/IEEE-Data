In this paper, we propose a novel coupled autoassociative neural network for learning a target-to-source image representation for heterogenous face recognition. This coupled network is unique, because a cross-modal transformation is learned by forcing the hidden units (latent features) of two neural networks to be as similar as possible, while simultaneously preserving information from the input. The effectiveness of this model is demonstrated using multiple existing heterogeneous face recognition databases. Moreover, the empirical results show that the learned image representation-common latent features-by the coupled auto-associative produces competitive cross-modal face recognition results. These results are obtained by training a softmax classifier using only the latent features from the source domain and testing using only the latent features from the target domain.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1620", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1632", "date_publication": "Thu Sep 17 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15478868", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 01 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1620 - 1632", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Benjamin S.
