It is also important to analyze the underlying hardware in cloud cluster servers to enable the optimization of software and hardware to achieve the maximum performance possible. Hadoop is based on MapReduce, which is one of the most popular programming models for big data analysis in a parallel computing environment. In this paper, we present a detailed performance analysis, characterization, and evaluation of Hadoop MapReduce WordCount application. We also propose an estimation model based on Amdahl's law regression method to estimate performance and total processing time versus different input sizes for a given processor architecture. The estimation regression model is verified to estimate performance and run time with an error margin of <;5%.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2784", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2793", "date_publication": "Fri Dec 18 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15656095", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 29 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2784 - 2793", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Joseph A.
