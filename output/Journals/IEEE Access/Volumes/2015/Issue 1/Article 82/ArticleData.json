Mobile cloud computing (MCC) in 5G has emerged as a key paradigm, promising to augment the capability of mobile devices through provisioning of computational resources on demand, and enabling resource-constrained mobile devices to offload their processing and storage requirements to the cloud infrastructure. Follow-me cloud (FMC), in turn, has emerged as a concept that allows seamless migration of services according to the corresponding users mobility. Meanwhile, software-defined networking (SDN) is a new paradigm that permits the decoupling of the control and data planes of traditional networks and provides programmability and flexibility, allowing the network to dynamically adapt to change traffic patterns and user demands. While the SDN implementations are gaining momentum, the control plane is still suffering from scalability and performance concerns for a very large network. In this paper, we address these scalability and performance issues in the context of 5G mobile networks by introducing a novel SDN/OpenFlow-based architecture and control plane framework tailored for MCC-based systems and more specifically for FMC-based systems where mobile nodes and network services are subject to constraints of movements and migrations. Contrary to a centralized approach with a single SDN controller, our approach permits the distribution of the SDN/OpenFlow control plane on a two-level hierarchical architecture: a first level with a Global FMC Controller (G-FMCC), and a second level with several Local FMC Controllers (L-FMCCs). Thanks to our control plane framework and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) concept, the L-FMCCs are deployed on-demand, where and when needed, depending on the global system load. Results ob- ained via analysis show that our solution ensures more efficient management of control plane, performance maintaining, and network resources preservation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2055", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2064", "date_publication": "Mon Oct 12 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15576558", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 09 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2055 - 2064", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Abdelkader Aissioui", "Adlen Ksentini", "Abdelhak Mourad Gueroui", "Tarik Taleb"], "keywords": ["5G mobile communication", "cloud computing", "computer network reliability", "data communication", "mobile computing", "mobility management (mobile radio)", "software defined networking", "telecommunication traffic", "5G mobile cloud management system", "5G mobile network architecture", "OpenFlow-based architecture", "cloud infrastructure", "control plane framework", "elastic distributed NFV controller", "elastic distributed SDN controller", "follow-me cloud", "global FMC controller", "high data rate applications", "high data rate services", "local FMC controller", "mobile cloud computing", "mobile data traffic pattern", "network function virtualization", "reliability requirement", "resource-constrained mobile device capability", "software defined networking", "two-level hierarchical architecture", "user demand", "user mobility", "5G mobile communication", "Cloud computing", "Computer architecture", "Data models", "Mobile computing", "Mobile handsets", "Network architecture", "Follow me cloud", "mobile cloud computing", "network function virtualization", "network management", "openflow", "scalability", "software defined networking", ""], "arnumber": "7296589"}
