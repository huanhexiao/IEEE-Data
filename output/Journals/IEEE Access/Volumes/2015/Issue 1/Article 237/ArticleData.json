For example, the biological clock is part of a much larger network controlling the circadian rhythms of about 2418 distinct genes in the genome (with 11 000 genes) of the model system, Neurospora crassa. Predicting and understanding the dynamics of all of these genes and their products in a genetic network describing how the clock functions is a challenge and beyond the current capability of the fastest serial computers. We have implemented a novel variable-topology supernet ensemble method using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations to fit and discover a regulatory network of unknown topology composed of 2418 genes describing the entire clock circadian network, a network that is found in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans, by harnessing the power of the general-purpose graphics processing unit and exploiting the hierarchical structure of that genetic network. The result is the construction of a genetic network that explains mechanistically how the biological clock functions in the filamentous fungus N. crassa and is validated against over 31 000 data points from microarray experiments. Two transcription factors are identified targeting ribosome biogenesis in the clock network.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "42", "date_publication": "Tue Feb 03 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14945588", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Feb 17 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "27 - 42", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Ahmad Al-Omari", "James Griffith", "Michael Judge", "Thiab Taha", "Jonathan Arnold", "H-Bernd Sch\u00fcttler"], "keywords": ["Markov processes", "Monte Carlo methods", "biology computing", "genetics", "graphics processing units", "learning (artificial intelligence)", "molecular biophysics", "GPGPU", "Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation", "Neurospora crassa", "biological clock", "circadian rhythm", "clock circadian network", "gene dynamics", "general-purpose graphics processing unit", "genetic network", "genetic networks", "genome", "regulatory network topology", "ribosome biogenesis", "variable-topology supernet ensemble method", "Biochemistry", "Biological system modeling", "Chronobiology", "Circadian rhythm", "Graphics processing units", "Molecular computing", "Monte Carlo methods", "Network toplogy", "Process control", "System performance", "Biological clock", "General-purpose graphical processing unit", "ensemble method", "general-purpose graphical processing unit", "regulatory network topologies", "supernet", "systems biology", ""], "arnumber": "7029612"}
