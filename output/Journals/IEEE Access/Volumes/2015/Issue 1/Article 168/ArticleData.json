Here, we focus on the kNN query processing in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Key challenges in designing system protocols for the MANETs include low-overhead adaptability to network topology changes due to node mobility, and query processing that achieves high accuracy of the query result without a centralized server. In this paper, we propose the filling area (FA) method to efficiently process kNN queries in the MANETs. The FA method achieves low overhead in query processing by reducing a search area. In the FA method, data items remain at nodes near the locations with which the items are associated, and nodes cache data items whose locations are near their own so that the query issuer retrieves kNNs from nearby nodes. Through extensive simulations, we verify that our proposed approach achieves low overhead and high accuracy of the query result.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "942", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "954", "date_publication": "Wed Jun 17 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15282484", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Jul 07 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "942 - 954", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Yuka Komai", "Yuya Sasaki", "Takahiro Hara", "Shojiro Nishio"], "keywords": ["mobile ad hoc networks", "mobility management (mobile radio)", "protocols", "query processing", "telecommunication network topology", "FA method", "MANET", "filling area method", "k nearest neighbor search", "kNN query", "location-based service", "location-dependent sensor data retrieval", "mobile ad hoc network topology", "node mobility", "query processing", "Ad hoc networks", "MANET", "Mobile communication", "Nearest neighbor searches", "Query processing", "Sensors", "${k}$ NN query", "LBS", "MANET", "kNN query", "location-dependent sensor data", ""], "arnumber": "7126920"}
