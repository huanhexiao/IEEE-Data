Foster and Chou (2014) reviewed published studies that used computer models of radio-frequency electromagnetic fields to estimate and compare the tissue dose rate in the heads of children and adults using mobile phones. Their review confuses exposure with absorption, and the study results conclude erroneously that children are not more exposed than adults. We show that their review was not executed systematically. There are discrepancies between text summaries and the graphed ratios of child: adult peak special specific absorption rate, in line with the author's hypothesis that children have the same or lower tissue dose than adults. Even the underlying precept of their review is flawed, as the results of deterministic models are treated as random variables. In fact, model results are entirely determined by the underlying assumptions and the structure of the model. Models are included in their unsystematic review that do not consider differences in dielectric constants among different tissues, or across ages, while other models that consider such differences are not included. In this paper, we discuss the differences between exposure and tissue absorption and re-examine the results presented by Foster and Chou. Based upon our review, we suggest an alternative interpretation of the published literature. In an Appendix, we discuss modeling of tissue dose in the context of governmental safety certification processes.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2379", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2387", "date_publication": "Wed Sep 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15638756", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 08 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2379 - 2387", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Robert D.
