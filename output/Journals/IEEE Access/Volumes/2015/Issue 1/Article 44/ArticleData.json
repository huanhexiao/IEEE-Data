In fact, some inventive algorithms have succeeded in computing the topological invariants, such as the number of objects or holes and irrespective of the shapes and positions of the touches. However, they are mostly offline algorithms aiming at big data. A real-time algorithm for computing topology is also needed for interactive applications such as touch sensors. Here, we propose a fast algorithm to compute the Euler characteristics of touch shapes by using the Poincare-Hopf index for each pixel. We demonstrate that our simple algorithm, implemented solely as logical operations in Arduino, correctly returns and updates the topological invariants of touches in real time.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2566", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2571", "date_publication": "Mon Nov 30 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15638883", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Dec 17 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2566 - 2571", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Keiji Miura", "Kazuki Nakada"], "keywords": ["Big Data", "feature extraction", "haptic interfaces", "indexing", "topology", "touch sensitive screens", "Big data", "Euler characteristics", "Poincare-Hopf index", "computational topology", "feature extraction", "inventive algorithm", "local pixelwise data", "perceptron", "tactile image data", "touch shape", "touch topology", "Feature extraction", "Indexes", "Lattices", "Real-time systems", "Shape", "Topology", "Poincare-Hopf index", "invariance", "sensor networks", "topology", "touch counter", ""], "arnumber": "7339652"}
