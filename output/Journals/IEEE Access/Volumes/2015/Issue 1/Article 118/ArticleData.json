This paper proposed a system that helps users automatically find a free parking space at the least cost based on new performance metrics to calculate the user parking cost by considering the distance and the total number of free places in each car park. This cost will be used to offer a solution of finding an available parking space upon a request by the user and a solution of suggesting a new car park if the current car park is full. The simulation results show that the algorithm helps improve the probability of successful parking and minimizes the user waiting time. We also successfully implemented the proposed system in the real world.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1581", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1591", "date_publication": "Wed Sep 09 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15462545", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Sep 23 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1581 - 1591", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Thanh Nam Pham", "Ming-Fong Tsai", "Duc Binh Nguyen", "Chyi-Ren Dow", "Der-Jiunn Deng"], "keywords": ["Internet of Things", "cloud computing", "minimisation", "probability", "software architecture", "software metrics", "traffic engineering computing", "Internet-of-Things technology", "cloud-based smart-parking system", "network architecture", "performance metrics", "probability", "traffic management system", "user parking cost", "user waiting time minimization", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Cloud computing", "Internet of things", "Performance evaluation", "Smart systems", "Smart-parking system", "performance metrics", ""], "arnumber": "7247632"}
