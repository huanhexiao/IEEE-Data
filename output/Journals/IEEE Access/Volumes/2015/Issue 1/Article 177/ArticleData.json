All the details on one of these labs (a two electric coupled drives system that allows performing control practices in a 2 \u00d7 2 MIMO system with industrial applications) and the activities that can be performed with it are given. We use a low-cost solution for developing the virtual and remote labs shared in this open course, based on the use of a free authoring tool Easy Java/Javascript Simulations (EJsS) for building the laboratories' user interfaces and a cheap development platform board (BeagleBone Black). The virtual and remote labs are deployed into a free Learning Management System (Moodle) Web environment that facilitates their management and maintenance.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "805", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "814", "date_publication": "Mon Jun 08 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15228048", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 23 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "805 - 814", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Jacobo S\u00e1enz", "Jes\u00fas Chac\u00f3n", "Luis De La Torre", "Antonio Visioli", "Sebasti\u00e1n Dormido"], "keywords": ["control engineering computing", "control engineering education", "distance learning", "laboratories", "learning management systems", "BeagleBone Black", "EJsS", "Easy Java/Javascript Simulations", "MIMO system", "Moodle", "University Network of Interactive Laboratories", "automatic control", "control engineering", "development platform board", "electric coupled drives system", "learning management system Web environment", "open course", "remote labs", "virtual labs", "Control systems", "Distance education", "Engineering education", "Remote laboratories", "Virtual laboratories", "Control engineering education", "Control systems", "Distance education", "Remote laboratories", "control engineering education", "control systems", "remote laboratories", ""], "arnumber": "7119567"}
