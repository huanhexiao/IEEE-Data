In this paper, we consider a two-stage NL maximization technique conceived for a fully-connected WSN, where the NL is strictly dependent on the source node's (SN) battery level, since we can transmit information generated at the SN to the destination node (DN) via alternative routes, each having a specific route lifetime (RL) value. During the first stage, the RL of the alternative routes spanning from the SN to the DN is evaluated, where the RL is defined as the earliest time, at which a sensor node lying in the route fully drains its battery charge. The second stage involves the summation of these RL values, until the SN's battery is fully depleted, which constitutes the lifetime of the WSN considered. Each alternative route is evaluated using cross-layer optimization of the power allocation, scheduling and routing operations for the sake of NL maximization for a predetermined per-link target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio values. Therefore, we propose the optimal but excessive-complexity algorithm, namely, the exhaustive search algorithm (ESA) and a near-optimal single objective genetic algorithm (SOGA) exhibiting a reduced complexity in a fully connected WSN. We demonstrate that in a high-complexity WSN, the SOGA is capable of approaching the ESA's NL within a tiny margin of 3.02% at a 2.56 times reduced complexity. We also show that our NL maximization approach is powerful in terms of prolonging the NL while striking a tradeoff between the NL and the quality of service requirements.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2191", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2226", "date_publication": "Mon Nov 09 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15591466", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Nov 18 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2191 - 2226", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Halil Yetgin", "Kent Tsz Kan Cheung", "Mohammed El-Hajjar", "Lajos Hanzo"], "keywords": ["genetic algorithms", "optimisation", "radiofrequency interference", "search problems", "telecommunication network routing", "wireless sensor networks", "DN", "ESA", "NL maximization technique", "SN battery level", "SOGA", "WSN", "battery charge", "battery constrained wireless sensor networks", "cross-layer optimization", "destination node", "exhaustive search algorithm", "nearoptimal single objective genetic algorithm", "network lifetime maximization", "per-link target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio values", "power allocation", "routing operations", "service requirements", "source node", "Batteries", "Complexity theory", "Maximation techniques", "Resource management", "Routing protocols", "Search problems", "Telecommunication network management", "Wireless sensor networks", "WSN", "network lifetime", "optimization", "wireless sensor networks", ""], "arnumber": "7322190"}
