The data provided herein may be used by antenna, propagation, and communications researchers for emerging mobile and/or backhaul millimeter-wave (mmWave) system analyses. This paper also presents measurement layout maps with transmitter and receiver locations and GPS coordinates, so that anyone may create similar or new measurements and models, or may perform further processing, such as with ray-tracers and modeling tools, in addition to studying mmWave system performance. Using the data provided herein, large-scale path loss models using a standard close-in 1 meter free-space reference distance are provided for each of the three frequency bands.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1573", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1580", "date_publication": "Thu Aug 06 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15443736", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 18 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1573 - 1580", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["George R.
