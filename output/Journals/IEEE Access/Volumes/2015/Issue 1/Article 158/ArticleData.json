The output power level distributions have been obtained through network-based measurements. In downlink, data from 868 RBSs were gathered during seven days. The RBSs were connected to five different radio network controllers (RNCs) located in different regions of India. The mean, the median, and the 95th percentile RBS output power values were found to be 24%, 21%, and 53%, respectively, of the maximum available power. In the uplink direction, output power levels of 3G devices connected to 1256 RBSs and the same five RNCs as in the downlink were assessed separately for voice, data, voice + data, and video applications. In total, more than 1 million hours of data traffic and more than 700 000 h of voice calls were measured in the uplink. The mean output power for the voice, data, the voice + data, and the video were found to be around 1%, 3%, 2%, and 4%, respectively, of the maximum available power for the 3G user devices. The findings are in line with previously published results obtained in other networks in Europe, and demonstrate that knowledge on realistic power levels is important for accurate assessments of the RF EMF exposure.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1051", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1059", "date_publication": "Tue Jul 07 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15298254", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jul 23 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1051 - 1059", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Paramananda Joshi", "Mukesh Agrawal", "Bj\u00f6rn Thors", "Davide Colombi", "Ashwani Kumar", "Christer T\u00f6rnevik"], "keywords": ["3G mobile communication", "telecommunication power management", "telecommunication traffic", "India", "data traffic", "power level distributions", "radio base station equipment", "radio frequency", "radio network controllers", "realistic RF EMF exposure", "user devices", "wideband code division multiple access based third generation mobile communication network", "3G mobile communication", "Downlink", "Electromagnetic fields", "Human factors", "Mobile communication", "Power distribution planning", "Power generation", "Power system measurements", "Power system reliability", "Radio base stations", "Uplink", "Wideband", "Output power", "Power distributions", "Realistic exposure", "UMTS", "WCDMA", "power distributions", "realistic exposure", ""], "arnumber": "7151792"}
