The Taguchi method is used to reduce the number of experiments and collect performance data for an SAW gas sensor. The TBGA has two optimization roles. In the ANFIS, the TBGA selects appropriate membership functions and optimizes both the premise and the consequent parameters by minimizing the performance criterion of the root mean squared error. Another role of the TBGA is optimizing design parameters for an SAW gas sensor. Simulated experimental application of the proposed TBGA-based ANFIS approach showed that, in terms of both resonant frequency shift and precision performance, this systematic design approach obtains far superior results compared with the conventional trial-and-error design methods and other Taguchi-based design methods.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "420", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "429", "date_publication": "Tue Apr 28 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15095453", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Wed May 06 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "420 - 429", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Jinn-Tsong Tsai", "Kai-Yu Chiu", "Jyh-Horng Chou"], "keywords": ["Taguchi methods", "computerised instrumentation", "fuzzy reasoning", "gas sensors", "genetic algorithms", "least mean squares methods", "minimisation", "surface acoustic wave sensors", "SAW gas sensor", "TBGA-based ANFIS approach", "Taguchi-based-genetic algorithm", "adaptive neurofuzzy inference system", "consequent parameter optimization", "design parameters optimization", "membership function", "performance criterion minimization", "premise parameter optimization", "resonant frequency shift", "root mean squared error", "surface acoustic wave", "systematic design approach", "Adaptive systems", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Design methodology", "Gas detectors", "Genetic algorithms", "Inference algorithms", "Surface acoustic waves", "Adaptive network fuzzy inference system", "Taguchi-genetic algorithm", "surface acoustic wave (SAW) gas sensors", ""], "arnumber": "7096926"}
