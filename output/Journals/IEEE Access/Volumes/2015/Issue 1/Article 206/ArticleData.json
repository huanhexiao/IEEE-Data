In this paper, we present an efficient data gathering scheme that guarantees the Quality of Service and optimizes the following network performance metrics as well as the end-to-end reliability in WSNs: (1) minimum total energy consumption; (2) minimum unit data transmitting energy consumption; and (3) maximum utilization efficiency defined as network lifetime per unit deployment. We first transform the performance optimization problem into a problem to optimize the following parameters: (1) deployed nodal number N*; (2) nodal placement d*; and (3) nodal transmission structure p*. Then, we prove that the optimization problem is solvable mathematically. For our observation, the sensor nodes close to the sink trend failed early since they consumed more energy with heavier relay traffic destined for the sink, which seriously affects the network performance. The key point of this optimization is adopting lower reliability requirements and shorter transmission distance for nodes near the sink. Consequently, this reduces the energy consumption of the nodes in the hotspot area. Meanwhile, it adopts higher reliability requirements and farther transmission distance for nodes far from the sink to make full use of the node residual energy, so as to optimize the network performance without harming network reliability. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that our optimal approach improves the network lifetime by 18%-48% and network utility by 17%, and guarantees desire reliability level.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "430", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "444", "date_publication": "Tue Apr 28 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15095452", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Wed May 06 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "430 - 444", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Jun Long", "Mianxiong Dong", "Kaoru Ota", "Anfeng Liu", "Songyuan Hai"], "keywords": ["data communication", "energy consumption", "optimisation", "quality of service", "telecommunication network reliability", "telecommunication power management", "telecommunication traffic", "wireless sensor networks", "WSN", "data gathering scheme", "end-to-end reliability", "energy consumption reduction", "network lifetime improvement", "nodal placement", "nodal transmission structure", "optimization problem", "quality of service", "relay traffic", "wireless sensor network", "Energy consumption", "Optimization", "Performance evaluation", "Privacy", "Quality of service", "Reliability", "Routing protocols", "Transforms", "Wireless communication", "Wireless sensor networks", "Wireless sensor networks", "network lifetime", "performance optimization", "source location privacy", "tree based routing", "wireless sensor networks,", ""], "arnumber": "7096923"}
