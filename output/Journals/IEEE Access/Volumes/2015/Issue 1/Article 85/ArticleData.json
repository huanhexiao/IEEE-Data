A thorough literature review on the impacts of residential EV charging is presented, followed by a proposed method for evaluating the impacts of EV loads on the distribution system voltage quality. Practical solutions to mitigate EV load impacts are discussed as well, including infrastructural changes and indirect controlled charging with time-of-use (TOU) pricing. An optimal TOU schedule is also presented, with the aim of maximizing both customer and utility benefits. This paper also presents a discussion on implementing smart charging algorithms to directly control EV charging rates and EV charging starting times. Finally, a controlled charging algorithm is proposed to improve the voltage quality at the EV load locations while avoiding customer inconvenience. The proposed method significantly decreases the impacts of EV load charging on system peak load demand and feeder voltages.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1871", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1893", "date_publication": "Mon Sep 14 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15560311", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Nov 06 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "1871 - 1893", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Anamika Dubey", "Surya Santoso"], "keywords": ["battery chargers", "battery powered vehicles", "dynamic programming", "power distribution control", "power distribution economics", "power supply quality", "EV charging rates", "EV charging starting times", "EV load impact mitigation", "controlled charging algorithm", "customer benefit maximization", "distribution system voltage quality", "dynamic programming", "indirect controlled charging-with-time-of-use pricing", "infrastructural changes", "optimal TOU schedule", "power quality", "residential distribution systems", "residential electric vehicle charging", "smart charging algorithms", "utility benefit maximization", "Controlled charging", "Dynamic programming", "Electric vehicles", "IEEE Standards", "Power system quality", "Pricing", "Voltage control", "Electric vehicle charging", "TOU pricing", "controlled charging", "distribution system", "dynamic programming", "power quality", "voltage quality", ""], "arnumber": "7264982"}
