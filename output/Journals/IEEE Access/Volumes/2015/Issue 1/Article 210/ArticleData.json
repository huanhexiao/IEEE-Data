However, most of the data-gathering strategies for WSNs cannot avoid the hotspot problem in local or whole deployment area. Hotspot problem affects the network connectivity and decreases the network lifetime. Hence, we propose a tree-cluster-based data-gathering algorithm (TCBDGA) for WSNs with a mobile sink. A novel weight-based tree-construction method is introduced. The root nodes of the constructed trees are defined as rendezvous points (RPs). Additionally, some special nodes called subrendezvous points (SRPs) are selected according to their traffic load and hops to root nodes. RPs and SRPs are viewed as stop points of the mobile sink for data collection, and can be reselected after a certain period. The simulation and comparison with other algorithms show that our TCBDGA can significantly balance the load of the whole network, reduce the energy consumption, alleviate the hotspot problem, and prolong the network lifetime.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "381", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "396", "date_publication": "Wed Apr 22 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15095459", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue May 05 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "381 - 396", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Chuan Zhu", "Shuai Wu", "Guangjie Han", "Lei Shu", "Hongyi Wu"], "keywords": ["mobile radio", "trees (mathematics)", "wireless sensor networks", "SRP", "TCBDGA", "WSN", "data collection", "data-gathering strategies", "heterogeneous sensory data", "hotspot problem", "mobile sink", "network connectivity", "network lifetime", "root nodes", "subrendezvous points", "traffic load", "tree-cluster-based data-gathering algorithm", "weight-based tree-construction method", "wireless sensor networks", "Clustering algorithms", "Data collection", "Energy consumption", "Industrial plants", "Information analysis", "Load modeling", "Mobile communication", "Tree data structures", "Wireless sensor networks", "Data-gathering scheme", "cluster", "data gathering scheme", "mobile sink", "wireless sensor networks", ""], "arnumber": "7091856"}
