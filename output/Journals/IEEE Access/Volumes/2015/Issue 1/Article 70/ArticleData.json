The awareness of contexts in big data is more difficult, and should be more in-depth than that of classical applications. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an in-depth context-awareness framework for a pervasive video cloud in order to obtain underlying contexts in big video data. In this framework, we propose an approach that combines the historical view with the current view to obtain meaningful in-depth contexts, where deep learning techniques are used to obtain raw context data. We have conducted initial evaluations to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of performance and also the accuracy of obtaining the contexts. The evaluation results show that the proposed approach is effective for real-time context-awareness in a pervasive video cloud.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2227", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2237", "date_publication": "Mon Nov 02 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15591462", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 19 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2227 - 2237", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Weishan Zhang", "Pengcheng Duan", "Zhongwei Li", "Qinghua Lu", "Wenjuan Gong", "Su Yang"], "keywords": ["cloud computing", "ubiquitous computing", "video communication", "big data applications", "context awareness", "deep awareness framework", "pervasive video cloud", "Cloud computing", "Context awareness", "Deep learning", "Pervasive computing", "Video communication", "Cloud Computing", "Context Awareness", "Deep Learning", "Framework", "Pervasive Video Cloud", "Pervasive video cloud", "cloud computing", "context awareness", "deep learning", "framework", ""], "arnumber": "7315021"}
