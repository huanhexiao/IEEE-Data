Much focus on multiscale decomposition for processing such signals have been based on scale-space theory and wavelet transforms. In this paper, we take a different perspective on multiscale decomposition by investigating the feasibility of utilizing a Bayesian-based method for multiscale signal decomposition called Bayesian residual transform (BRT) for the purpose of physiological signal processing. In BRT, a signal is modeled as the summation of residual signals, each characterizing information from the signal at different scales. A deep cascading framework is introduced as a realization of the BRT. Signal-to-noise ratio analysis using electrocardiography signals was used to illustrate the feasibility of using the BRT for suppressing the noise in physiological signals. Results in this paper show that it is feasible to utilize the BRT for processing physiological signals for tasks, such as noise suppression.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "709", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "717", "date_publication": "Tue May 26 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15193791", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 09 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "709 - 717", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Alexander Wong", "Xiao Yu Wang"], "keywords": ["Bayes methods", "electrocardiography", "medical signal processing", "wavelet transforms", "BRT", "Bayesian residual transform", "Bayesian-based method", "deep cascading framework", "electrocardiography signals", "multiscale decomposition", "multiscale signal decomposition", "physiological signal processing", "residual signals", "scale-space theory", "signal-to-noise ratio analysis", "wavelet transforms", "Electrocardiography", "Multi-scale decomposition", "Noise abatement", "Physiological signals", "Signal processing algorithms", "Signal processing", "electrocardiography", "multi-scale", "noise suppression", "physiological signals", "signal processing", ""], "arnumber": "7112624"}
