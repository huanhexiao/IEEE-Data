Considering the nonlinear and dynamic property of QoS data, it is so difficult to achieve dynamic prediction while designing a QoS prediction method with unsatisfactory prediction accuracy. It is thus desirable to explore how to design an effective approach by incorporating some intelligent techniques into the QoS prediction method to improve prediction performance. In this paper, motivated by the adaptive critic design and Q-learning technique, we propose a novel QoS prediction approach to serve this purpose through the combination of fuzzy neural networks and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP), i.e., an online learning scheme. This approach extracts fuzzy rules from QoS data and employs the ADP method to parameter learning of the fuzzy rules. Moreover, we provide a convergence boundedness result for our proposed approach to guarantee the stability. Experimental results on a large-scale QoS service data set verify the prediction accuracy of our proposed approach.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2260", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2269", "date_publication": "Fri Nov 06 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15591469", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Nov 20 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2260 - 2269", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Xiong Luo", "Yixuan Lv", "Ruixing Li", "Yi Chen"], "keywords": ["Web services", "cloud computing", "convergence", "dynamic programming", "fuzzy neural nets", "learning (artificial intelligence)", "quality of service", "ADP", "Q-learning technique", "QoS prediction method", "Web service", "adaptive critic design", "adaptive dynamic programming", "cloud computing environment", "cloud service", "convergence", "fuzzy neural network", "large-scale QoS service data", "online learning scheme", "quality-of-service", "Artificial neural networks", "Cloud computing", "Dynamic programming", "Fuzzy control", "Fuzzy neural networks", "Quality of service", "Adaptive Dynamic Programming", "Cloud Services", "Fuzzy Neural Network", "QoS Prediction", "QoS prediction", "Quality of Service (QoS)", "Quality of service (QoS)", "adaptive dynamic programming", "cloud services", "fuzzy neural network", ""], "arnumber": "7321781"}
