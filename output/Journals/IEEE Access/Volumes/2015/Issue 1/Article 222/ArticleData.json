After investigating various design approaches for variable stiffness actuated (VSA) robots, currently the focus is shifting to the control of these systems. Control of VSA robots is challenging due to the intrinsic nonlinearity of their dynamicsdynamics and the need to satisfy constraints on input and state variables. Contrary to the partially open-loop state-of-the-art approaches, in this paper, we present a close-loop control framework for VSA robots leveraging recent increases in computational resources and advances in optimization algorithms. In particular, we generate reference trajectories by means of open-loop optimal control, and track these trajectories via nonlinear model predictive control in a closed-loop manner. In order to show the advantages of our proposed scheme with respect to the previous (partially open-loop) ones, extensive simulation and real-world experiments were conducted using a two link planar manipulator for a ball throwing task. The results of these experiments indicate that the closed-loop scheme outperforms the partially open loop one due to its ability to compensate for model uncertainties and external disturbances, while satisfying the imposed constraints.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "235", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "248", "date_publication": "Tue Mar 31 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15056007", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 13 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "235 - 248", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Altay Zhakatayev", "Matteo Rubagotti", "Huseyin Atakan Varol"], "keywords": ["closed loop systems", "elastic constants", "human-robot interaction", "manipulator dynamics", "nonlinear control systems", "open loop systems", "optimal control", "optimisation", "predictive control", "trajectory control", "uncertain systems", "VSA robots", "ball throwing task", "close-loop control framework", "computational resources", "design approach", "external disturbances", "human-robot interaction", "input variables", "intrinsic dynamics nonlinearity", "model uncertainties", "nonlinear model predictive control", "open-loop optimal control", "optimization algorithms", "planar manipulator", "reference trajectory generation", "state variables", "variable stiffness actuated robots", "Closed loop systems", "Design methodology", "Heuristic algorithms", "Human-robot interaction", "Kinematics", "Nonlinear systems", "Predictive control", "Robots", "Embedded Optimization", "Model Predictive Control", "Optimization Algorithms", "Robot Manipulation", "Robot manipulation", "Variable Stiffness Actuation", "embedded optimization", "model predictive control", "optimization algorithms", "variable stiffness actuation", ""], "arnumber": "7073614"}
