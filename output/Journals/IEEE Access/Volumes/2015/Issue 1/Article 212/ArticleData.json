Recently, an attractive energy harvesting technology has shown great potential to the improvement of the network throughput, as it can provide consistent energy for wireless devices to transmit data. Motivated by that, an efficient energy harvesting-based medium access control (MAC) protocol is designed in this paper. In this protocol, different devices first harvest energy adaptively and then contend the transmission opportunities with energy level related priorities. Then, a new model is proposed to obtain the optimal throughput of the network, together with the corresponding hybrid differential evolution algorithm, where the involved variables are energy-harvesting time, contending time, and contending probability. Analytical and simulation results show that the network based on the proposed MAC protocol has greater throughput than that of the traditional methods. In addition, as expected, our scheme has less transmission delay, further enhancing its superiority.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "358", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "367", "date_publication": "Fri Apr 10 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15087878", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Apr 30 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "358 - 367", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Yi Liu", "Zuyuan Yang", "Rong Yu", "Yong Xiang", "Shengli Xie"], "keywords": ["access protocols", "energy harvesting", "evolutionary computation", "telecommunication power management", "adaptive energy harvesting", "efficient MAC protocol", "hybrid differential evolution algorithm", "machine-to-machine networks", "medium access control protocol", "Energy harvesting", "Energy levels", "Machine-to-machine communications", "Media Access Protocol", "Performance evaluation", "Wireless communication", "Machine-to-machine network", "adaptive energy harvesting", "medium access control", ""], "arnumber": "7084097"}
