In this context, the distribution of frequency resources among multi-beams plays an important role. This is because unsuitable distributions might cause the wastage or the starvation of frequencies and bring about low throughput rates. This paper proposes a solution to mitigate the unsuitable allocations of frequency resources in an HTS. The solution is the priority code scheme (PCS), which seeks to respond to users' demands by dynamically scheduling frequency resources for precise satellite footprint areas. The key is to assign a priority code and an efficiency indicator to every multi-beam deployed on the system. The PCS algorithm involves the association of the efficiency indicator with the bandwidth utilization per beam to detect and correct arbitrary bandwidth allocations among the beams. Due to the PCS's cyclical repetition of its algorithm, the concurrence time of the scheme and the tardiness of the algorithm form part of the evaluation of the PCS. Furthermore, we support the implementation of the frequency-reuse process to enhance the exploitation of frequency resources. To evaluate the PCS performance, the analysis delves into the study of the bandwidth utilization, the interference among beams, the concurrence time, and the algorithm tardiness.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2044", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2054", "date_publication": "Fri Oct 30 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15560312", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Nov 06 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2044 - 2054", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Lilian Del Consuelo Hernandez Ruiz Gaytan", "Zhenni Pan", "Jiang Liu", "Shigeru Shimamoto"], "keywords": ["encoding", "satellite communication", "scheduling", "HTS", "PCS cyclical repetition", "bandwidth utilization", "dynamic scheduling", "frequency resources", "frequency reuse process", "frequency starvation", "high throughput satellites", "multibeams", "priority code scheme", "satellite footprint areas", "scheduling frequency resources", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Bandwidth allocation", "Interference", "Multi-beams", "Satellite communication", "Scheduling", "Algorithm", "bandwidth allocation", "high throughput satellites", "interference", "multi-beams", "priority codes", "scheduling", ""], "arnumber": "7312880"}
