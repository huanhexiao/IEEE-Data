First, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for pixel labeling to extract building regions. Using the trained CNN, we create a building probability map from an input aerial image with no pre-processing. We then use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the optimal seamline as a shortest path on the map. We evaluate the quality of the seamlines produced by our method on actual aerial images. Finally, we show that our seamlines never pass through any buildings and compare the effectiveness with the conventional mean-shift segmentation-based method.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2847", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2856", "date_publication": "Thu Dec 17 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15673501", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 05 00:00:00 EST 2016", "pages": "2847 - 2856", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Shunta Saito", "Ryota Arai", "Yoshimitsu Aoki"], "keywords": ["geophysical image processing", "image segmentation", "learning (artificial intelligence)", "probability", "remote sensing", "CNN training", "Dijkstra algorithm", "aerial image mosaicking", "building probability map", "building region extraction", "convolutional neural network training", "pixel labeling", "seamline determination", "semantic segmentation", "Buildings", "Data mining", "Image color analysis", "Image segmentation", "Semantics", "Shortest path problem", "Remote sensing", "artificial neural networks", "computer vision", "image processing", "neural networks", ""], "arnumber": "7355281"}
