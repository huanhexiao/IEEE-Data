Moreover, contending memory bandwidth among parallel running VMs leads to poor quality of service (QoS) of the multimedia applications, missing the deadlines of these soft real-time multimedia applications. In this paper, we present an adaptive framework, Service Maximization Optimization (SMO), which is designed to improve the QoS of the soft real-time multimedia applications in multimedia cloud computing. The framework consists of an automatic detection mechanism and an adaptive memory bandwidth control mechanism. With the automatic detection mechanism, the critical section to the multimedia application performance in the VMs is detected. Then, our adaptive memory bandwidth control mechanism adjusts the memory access rates of all the parallel running VMs to protect the QoS of the soft real-time multimedia applications. From the case studies with real-world multimedia applications, our SMO significantly improves the QoS of the soft real-time multimedia applications with a negligible penalty on system throughput.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "2129", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "2139", "date_publication": "Mon Nov 02 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15638742", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 12 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "2129 - 2139", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Gangyong Jia", "Guangjie Han", "Daqiang Zhang", "Li Liu", "Lei Shu"], "keywords": ["cloud computing", "manufacturing systems", "multimedia computing", "production engineering computing", "quality of service", "real-time systems", "virtual machines", "QoS", "SMO", "VM", "adaptive memory bandwidth control mechanism", "automatic detection mechanism", "industrial systems", "memory access rates", "multimedia cloud computing", "quality of service improvement", "service maximization optimization", "soft real-time multimedia applications", "virtual machines", "Bandwidth allocation", "Memory management", "Multimedia communication", "Quality of service", "Real-time systems", "Memory bandwidth", "memory access", "multimedia application", "quality of service", "soft real-time", ""], "arnumber": "7314854"}
