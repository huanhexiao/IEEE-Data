The traditional attendance systems typically focus on collecting employee attendance information and are not suited to the quantification of work performance. As a remedy to this issue, a smart work performance measurement system is proposed in this paper. The proposed system consists of three components: 1) a smartphone-based APP to collect employee attendance, work, and location information; 2) a data warehouse to preprocess and store the data; and 3) a smart data analysis center to make a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of employee work performance. Management can obtain the key information quickly and adjust work assignments based on performance. New solutions and algorithms for indoor and outdoor location, GPS deviation improvement, and work performance measurement are put forward. This system is being used by over 1100 police officers in one city traffic management bureau, and the observed results are encouraging, demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of our system, and helping governments to better regulate the traffic operation and reduce associated costs.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1755", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1764", "date_publication": "Thu Sep 24 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15543314", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 19 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1755 - 1764", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Wei Yuan", "Pan Deng", "Chao Yang", "Jiafu Wan", "Daqiang Zhang", "Xiantong Chen", "Chaofan Bi", "Yali Liu"], "keywords": ["data analysis", "police data processing", "smart phones", "GPS deviation improvement", "city traffic management bureau", "comprehensive evaluation", "employee attendance", "indoor location", "location information", "outdoor location", "police officers", "smart data analysis", "smart work performance measurement system", "smartphone-based APP", "systematic evaluation", "work assignments", "work performance measurement", "Big data", "Employment", "Law enforcement", "Performance evaluation", "Smart phones", "Traffic control", "Attendance management", "Big data", "GPS", "Police officer", "Work performance measurement", "big data", "police officer", "work performance measurement", ""], "arnumber": "7275082"}
