The IoT has a variety of application domains, including health care. The IoT revolution is redesigning modern health care with promising technological, economic, and social prospects. This paper surveys advances in IoT-based health care technologies and reviews the state-of-the-art network architectures/platforms, applications, and industrial trends in IoT-based health care solutions. In addition, this paper analyzes distinct IoT security and privacy features, including security requirements, threat models, and attack taxonomies from the health care perspective. Further, this paper proposes an intelligent collaborative security model to minimize security risk; discusses how different innovations such as big data, ambient intelligence, and wearables can be leveraged in a health care context; addresses various IoT and eHealth policies and regulations across the world to determine how they can facilitate economies and societies in terms of sustainable development; and provides some avenues for future research on IoT-based health care based on a set of open issues and challenges.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "678", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "708", "date_publication": "Mon Jun 01 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15210755", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Thu Jun 04 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "678 - 708", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["S.
