Wearable inertial sensors can offer more objective measures of patient movement and progress. We undertook a study to investigate the contribution of wearable sensor data to predict discharge functional independence measure (FIM) scores for 20 patients at an inpatient rehabilitation facility. The FIM utilizes a seven-point ordinal scale to measure patient independence while performing several activities of daily living, such as walking, grooming, and bathing. Wearable inertial sensor data were collected from ecological ambulatory tasks at two time points mid-stay during inpatient rehabilitation. Machine learning algorithms were trained with sensor-derived features and clinical information obtained from medical records at admission to the inpatient facility. While models trained only with clinical features predicted discharge scores well, we were able to achieve an even higher level of prediction accuracy when also including the wearable sensor-derived features. Correlations as high as 0.97 for leave-one-out cross validation predicting discharge FIM motor scores are reported.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1350", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "1366", "date_publication": "Thu Aug 13 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "15406002", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 26 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "pages": "1350 - 1366", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Gina Sprint", "Diane J.
