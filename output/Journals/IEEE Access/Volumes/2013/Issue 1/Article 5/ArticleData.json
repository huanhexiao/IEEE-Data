To carry out the computation of the trajectory of the system, a hierarchical structure of the ODEs is exploited, and an ARK solver is implemented in compute unified device architecture/C++ (CUDA/C++) on GPUs. The result is a 75-fold speedup for calculations of 2436 independent modules within the genetic network describing clock function relative to a comparable CPU architecture. These 2436 modules span one-quarter of the entire genome of a model fungal system, Neurospora crassa. The power of a GPU can in principle be harnessed by using warp-level parallelism, instruction level parallelism or both of them. Since the ARK ODE solver is entirely sequential, we propose a new parallel processing algorithm using warp-level parallelism for solving ~ 10 000 ODEs that belong to a large genetic network describing clock genome-level dynamics. A video is attached illustrating the general idea of the method on GPUs that can be used to provide new insights into the biological clock through single cell measurements on the clock.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "770", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "777", "date_publication": "Tue Nov 12 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "13912854", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 21 00:00:00 EST 2013", "pages": "770 - 777", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Ahmad Al-Omari", "Jonathan Arnold", "Thiab Taha", "Heinz-Bernd Sch\u00fcttler"], "keywords": ["Runge-Kutta methods", "bioinformatics", "differential equations", "graphics processing units", "mathematics computing", "nonlinear equations", "nonlinear systems", "parallel algorithms", "parallel architectures", "ARK method", "ARK solver", "CPU architecture", "CUDA-C++", "adaptive runge Kutta ODE solver", "biological clock function", "clock genome-level dynamics", "compute unified device architecture", "first-order ordinary differential equations", "hierarchical structure", "instruction level parallelism", "large genetic network", "large nonlinear systems", "model fungal system", "multiGPGPUs", "multigeneral-purpose graphical processing units", "neurospora crassa", "parallel processing algorithm", "single cell measurements", "systems biology", "warp-level parallelism", "Bioinformatics", "Clocks", "Genomics", "Graphics processing units", "Instruction sets", "Parallel processing", "Bioinformatics", "adaptive Runge&#x2013", "Kutta integration", "biological clock", "finite element method", "general-purpose graphical processing unit", "ordinary differential equation", "systems biology", "warp-level parallelism", ""], "arnumber": "6662399"}
