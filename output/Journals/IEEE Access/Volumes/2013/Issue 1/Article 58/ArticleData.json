Designing out failures using lessons learned can result in very high reliability and significantly lower warranty costs. The quickest way to make use of the lessons learned is to learn from heuristics which are short statements based on wisdom from lessons learned over many products. The article covers examples to show how the heuristics were applied to successful products.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "63", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "66", "date_publication": "2013", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "13730368", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Fri May 10 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "pages": "63 - 66", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Dev Raheja"], "keywords": ["design engineering", "durability", "electrical products", "electronic products", "failure analysis", "reliability", "warranties", "costly scope creeps", "design changes", "electrical products", "electronic products", "product specifications", "reliability design heuristics", "warranty costs", "Consumer protection", "Costs", "Design methodology", "Maintenance engineering", "Product design", "Product liability", "Product life cycle management", "Product safety engineering", "Reliability", "Reliability engineering", "Warranties", "Customer requirements", "design for durability", "design for reliability", "durability", "durability requirements", "environmental requirements", "failure modes and effects analysis", "functional performance", "life cycle cost", "reliability requirements", "reliability test plan", "requirements analysis", "safety critical failure", "user interface requirements", ""], "arnumber": "6514817"}
