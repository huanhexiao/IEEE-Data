It is believed that template aging does not occur for iris recognition. Several research groups, however, have recently reported experimental results showing that iris template aging does occur. This template aging effect manifests as a shift in the authentic distribution, resulting in an increased false non-match rate. Analyzing results from a three-year time-lapse data set, we find ~150% increase in the false non-match rate at a decision threshold representing a one in two million false match rate. We summarize several known elements of eye aging that could contribute to template aging, including age-related change in pupil dilation. Finally, we discuss various steps that can control the template aging effect in typical identity verification applications.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "266", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "274", "date_publication": "Thu May 16 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "13517740", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Thu May 23 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "pages": "266 - 274", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Samuel P.
