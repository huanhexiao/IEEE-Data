Several prototypes operating in the band 1 (31-45 GHz) of the atacama large millimeter array have been fabricated and measured. The design is based on the use of a turnstile junction that is machined in a single block, requiring neither alignment nor a high degree of mechanical tolerances. Thus, a high repeatability of the design is possible for mass production. Across the 31-45 GHz band, the isolation is better than 50 dB and the return losses at the input and outputs of the OMT are better than -25 dB.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "480", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "487", "date_publication": "Thu Jul 18 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "13696628", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "pages": "480 - 487", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["David Dousset", "St\u00e9phane Claude", "Ke Wu"], "keywords": ["aluminium", "circular waveguides", "millimetre wave antenna arrays", "rectangular waveguides", "Al", "aluminum blocks", "atacama large millimeter array", "circular waveguide", "compact high-performance orthomode transducer", "frequency 31 GHz to 45 GHz", "high repeatability", "mechanical tolerances", "rectangular waveguide", "Aluminum", "Milling", "Ports (Computers)", "Rectangular waveguides", "Transducers", "Waveguide junctions", "Radio astronomy", "orthomode transducer (OMT)", "polarization diplexer", "turnstile junction", ""], "arnumber": "6563095"}
