Dynamic energy appears to be one possible technique. A method of mathematics is used with curved space vectors which greatly reduces the calculus. The vector relationship between cyclic time and reference time is identified. A diffusion relationship is developed which has the potential for describing the Higgs field. The diffusion is defined in terms of a volume gradient varying with reference time. By judicious definition of dynamic energy, the diffusion is also a direct relationship of electrical charge and magnetism with waves or photons, and mass.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "505", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "508", "date_publication": "Fri Aug 02 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "13689009", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 15 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "pages": "505 - 508", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Marcus O.
