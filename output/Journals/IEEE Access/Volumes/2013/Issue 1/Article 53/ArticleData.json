Using the leading cholesteric liquid crystal technology of ITRI, we develop a rewritable, environmentally friendly thermal printable e-paper. The epaper, devised to reduce traditional paper consumption, achieves a high resolution of 300 dpi with a memory function. In addition, we report on the ITRI's initial success in demonstrating a complete R2R process for multisensing touch panels on 100-\u03bcm thick flexible glass substrates provided by Corning.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "150", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "158", "date_publication": "2013", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "13730369", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Fri May 10 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "pages": "150 - 158", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Janglin Chen", "C.
