In this paper, this flexibility is utilized to improve energy efficiency and performance of combinatorial circuits by manipulating their critical and noncritical paths. An approach that locates the design's critical paths and operates these paths in the boosted performance mode is proposed. The noncritical paths are operated in the low energy DML mode, which does not affect the performance of the design, but allows significant energy consumption reduction. The proposed approach is analyzed on a 128 bit carry skip adder. Simulations, carried out in a standard 40 nm digital CMOS process with , show that the proposed approach allows performance improvement of X2 along with reduction of energy consumption of X2.5, as compared with a standard CMOS implementation. At , improvements of 1.3X and 1.5X in performance and energy are achieved, respectively.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "258", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "265", "date_publication": "Fri May 10 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "13517738", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Tue May 21 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "pages": "258 - 265", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Itamar Levi", "Alexander Fish"], "keywords": ["CMOS integrated circuits", "adders", "combinational circuits", "energy conservation", "logic design", "logic gates", "low-power electronics", "DML gates", "boosted performance mode", "carry skip adder", "combinatorial circuits", "design performance", "digital CMOS process", "dual mode logic gates", "energy consumption reduction", "energy efficiency", "energy-delay optimization flexibility", "gate level", "low energy DML mode", "noncritical paths", "performance improvement", "standard CMOS implementation", "CMOS integrated circuits", "Energy consumption", "Energy efficiency", "Logic gates", "Standards", "Topology", "Transistors", "Dual Mode Logic", "critical paths", "energy efficiency", "energy-delay optimization", "high performance", ""], "arnumber": "6514913"}
