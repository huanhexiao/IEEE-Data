Two existing DRAM cells (namely the 3T1D and B3T cells) are utilized as volatile cores; a RRAM circuitry (consisting of an access control transistor and an oxide resistive RAM) is added to the core to extend its operation for non-volatile operation; two NVDRAM cells are then proposed. Considerations, such as the threshold voltage for the refresh operation and output read circuitry, are also considered. The impacts of the non-volatile circuitry as well as the DRAM core selection are assessed by HSPICE simulation. Figures of merit as related to performance, process variability, power consumption, and circuit design (critical charge and area of cell layout) are established for both volatile and non-volatile DRAM cells as well as memory arrays.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "758", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "769", "date_publication": "Fri Nov 01 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "13887959", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 11 00:00:00 EST 2013", "pages": "758 - 769", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Wei Wei", "Kazuteru Namba", "Fabrizio Lombardi"], "keywords": ["DRAM chips", "3T1D", "B3T cells", "DRAM cells", "DRAM core selection", "HSPICE simulation", "RRAM circuitry", "access control transistor", "circuit design", "dynamic random access memory", "memory array", "nonvolatile operation", "output read circuitry", "oxide resistive RAM", "oxide-based resistive element", "power consumption", "process variability", "threshold voltage", "volatile cores", "Nonvolatile memory", "Power dissipation", "Random access memory", "Resistance", "Threshold voltage", "Tin", "Transistors", "Memory design", "dynamic random-access memory (DRAM)", "non-volatile operation", ""], "arnumber": "6651631"}
