Establishing generalized SNR (GSNR) as a rigorous information theoretic measure inherent in any set of observations significantly strengthens its quantitative performance pedigree while simultaneously providing a specific definition under general conditions. In turn, this directly leads to consideration of the log likelihood ratio (LLR): first, as the simplest possible information-preserving transformation (i.e., signal processing algorithm) and subsequently, as an absolute, comparable measure of information for any specific observation exemplar. The information accounting methodology that results permits practical use of both GSNR and LLR as diagnostic scalar performance measurements, directly comparable across alternative system/algorithm designs, applicable at any tap point within any processing string, in a form that is also comparable with the inherent performance bounds due to information conservation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "509", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "522", "date_publication": "Thu Aug 15 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "13710211", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Mon Aug 26 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "pages": "509 - 522", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["John Polcari"], "keywords": ["decision theory", "maximum likelihood estimation", "signal processing", "GSNR", "LLR", "decision theory", "diagnostic scalar performance measurements", "generalized SNR", "information theoretic basis", "information theory", "informative interpretation", "log likelihood ratio", "signal processing concept", "signal-to-noise ratio", "Bayes methods", "Information theory", "Noise measurement", "Random variables", "Signal processing algorithms", "Signal to noise ratio", "Data compression", "Kullback-Leibler divergence", "decision theory", "detection algorithms", "information measures", "information theory", "log likelihood ratio", "performance evaluation", "performance measures", "self-scaling property", "signal processing algorithms", "signal to noise ratio", "statistical analysis", ""], "arnumber": "6578071"}
