The database contains two corpora: 1) doodles and 2) pseudo-signatures, which are simplified finger-drawn versions of the handwritten signature. The dataset includes genuine samples and forgeries, produced under worst-case conditions, where attackers have visual access to the drawing process. Statistical and qualitative analyzes of the data are presented, comparing doodles and pseudo-signatures to handwritten signatures. Time variability, learning curves, and discriminative power of different features are also studied. Verification performance against forgeries is analyzed using state-of-the-art algorithms and benchmark results are provided.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "596", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "605", "date_publication": "Mon Sep 16 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "13821593", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Wed Sep 25 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "pages": "596 - 605", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Marcos Martinez-Diaz", "Julian Fierrez", "Javier Galbally"], "keywords": ["benchmark testing", "data analysis", "handwriting recognition", "mobile handsets", "security of data", "statistical analysis", "touch sensitive screens", "visual databases", "DooDB graphical password database", "benchmark results", "doodle database", "drawing process", "forgeries", "genuine samples", "handwritten signature finger-drawn versions", "learning curves", "pseudosignatures", "qualitative data analysis", "realistic conditions", "statistical data analysis", "systematic protocol", "time variability", "touch screen-enabled mobile device", "visual access", "Authentication", "Benchmark testing", "Complexity theory", "Databases", "Protocols", "Visualization", "Graphical password", "doodle verification", "pseudo-signature", ""], "arnumber": "6600733"}
