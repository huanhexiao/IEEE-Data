They are accomplished with a particular augmentation of the original near-field-resonant-parasitic (NFRP) antenna with an additional NFRP element, a small disc conductor modified with two meanderline-shaped slots. The entire system is evaluated numerically with two independent computational electromagnetics simulators. The optimized results demonstrate an electrically small antenna (i.e., ka <; 1.0) with a reasonably low profile (i.e., height ~ \u03bb/10) that improves the directivity from 1.77 to 6.32 dB, increases the FTBR from 0 to > 20 dB, and maintains large half-power beamwidths, while having a radiation efficiency over 80% with nearly complete matching to a 50 \u03a9 source.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "16", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "28", "date_publication": "2013", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "13730370", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Fri May 10 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "pages": "16 - 28", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Ming-Chun Tang", "Richard W.
