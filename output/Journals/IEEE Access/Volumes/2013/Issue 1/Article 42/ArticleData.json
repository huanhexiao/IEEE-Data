To enhance its competitiveness and expand its global impact, the Taiwan government commenced the National Program for Intelligent Electronics (NPIE) in 2011 to promote technological innovation of medical electronics, green electronics, vehicular (car) electronics, conventional computer, communication, and consumer electronics, the so-called \u201cMG+4C\u201d applications. The government allocated a budget of $430 million over 5 years to facilitate technology development, advanced research, talent cultivation, industry promotion, and international collaboration. By coordinating with government agencies, research institutions, universities, and corporations, the NPIE develops an integrated framework of academia and industry in Taiwan. It also emphasizes the enhancement of product verification, regulations, and participation in international alliances and standards. By transferring academic results to industry in emerging MG+4C applications, it is expected that the NPIE will contribute to the global semiconductor community, energize Taiwan's IC industry, and create innovative products and intelligent systems for better life and better environment.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "123", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "130", "date_publication": "Fri May 10 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "13528377", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Thu May 30 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "pages": "123 - 130", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Wen-Tsuen Chen", "Youn-Long Lin", "Chen-Yi Lee", "Jeng-Long Chiang", "Meng-Fan Chang", "Shih-Chieh Chang"], "keywords": ["semiconductor industry", "MG+4C applications", "NPIE", "National Program for Intelligent Electronics", "Taiwan IC industry", "Taiwan semiconductor industry", "consumer electronics", "electronics industry", "global IT industry", "global semiconductor community", "government agencies", "green electronics", "medical electronics", "product verification enhancement", "vehicular electronics", "Biomedical monitoring", "Consumer electronics", "Electronics industry", "Green products", "Integrated circuits", "Low power electronics", "Semiconductor devices", "System-on-chip", "Electronics industry", "automotive electronics", "integrated circuit technology", "low power electronics", "medical electronics", "power electronics", "system-on-a-chip", "three-dimensional integrated circuits", ""], "arnumber": "6515295"}
