A new definition of optimal intermediate band filling is proposed. A mathematical model is developed to optimize the intermediate band solar cell (IBSC) structure under idealized conditions, which calculates the optimal ratio of the subbandgap absorption coefficient constants and the optimal position of IB.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "363", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "370", "date_publication": "Mon May 27 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "13551726", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 11 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "pages": "363 - 370", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Urmita Sikder", "Anisul Haque"], "keywords": ["absorption coefficients", "quantum dots", "solar cells", "IB filling", "IB position", "IBSC structure", "QD-IBSC efficiency", "idealized quantum dot intermediate band solar cell optimization", "intermediate band filling", "mathematical model", "optimal intermediate band filling", "subbandgap absorption coefficient constants", "subbandgap generation rate spatial variation", "Absorption", "Energy conversion", "Energy efficiency", "Integrated circuits", "Integrated optics", "Photovoltaic cells", "Short-circuit currents", "Solar cells", "IB position", "Intermediate band solar cell (IBSC)", "absorption coefficients", "conversion efficiency", "optimal filling", ""], "arnumber": "6520875"}
