The application of advanced architecture simulators will play a crucial role for the design and optimization of future data intensive applications. In this paper, we present our simulation-based framework for analyzing the scalability and performance of a number of critical optimizations of a massively parallel genomic search application, mpiBLAST, using an advanced macroscale simulator (SST/macro). We report the use of our framework for the evaluation of three potential improvements of mpiBLAST: 1) enabling high-performance parallel output; 2) an approach for caching database fragments in memory; and 3) a methodology for pre-distributing database segments. In our experimental setup, we performed query sequence matching on the genome of the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "428", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "435", "date_publication": "Thu Jul 04 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "13628259", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Jul 12 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "pages": "428 - 435", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Damian Dechev", "Tae-Hyuk Ahn"], "keywords": ["application program interfaces", "biology computing", "data handling", "ecology", "message passing", "optimisation", "parallel processing", "query processing", "software architecture", "Aedes aegypti", "MPI based applications", "SST-Macro", "advanced architecture simulators", "advanced macroscale simulator", "caching database fragments", "data intensive applications", "effective analysis", "evaluating large scale genomic sequence search", "massively parallel genomic search application", "mpiBLAST", "node architectures", "predistributing database segments", "query sequence matching", "simulation based framework", "yellow fever mosquito", "Computer applications", "Distributed processing", "Message passing", "Multiprocessors", "Scalability", "Exascale architecture simulator", "message passing interface", "mpiBLAST", "multiprocessor programming", "performance and scalability modeling", ""], "arnumber": "6553357"}
