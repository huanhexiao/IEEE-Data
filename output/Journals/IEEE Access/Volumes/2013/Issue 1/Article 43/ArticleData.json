Solving this problem necessitates: 1) estimation of the wireless propagation environment to identify viable point-to-point communication links; 2) determination of end-to-end routes to support data traffic; and 3) motion control algorithms to navigate through spatial configurations that guarantee required minimum levels of service. Therefore, we present methods for: 1) estimation of point-to-point channels using pathloss and spatial Gaussian process models; 2) data routing so as to determine suitable end-to-end communication routes given estimates of point-to-point channel rates; and 3) motion planning to determine robot trajectories restricted to configurations that ensure survival of the communication network. Because of the inherent uncertainty of wireless channels, the model of links and routes is stochastic. The criteria for route selection is to maximize the probability of network survival-defined as the ability to support target communication rates-given achievable rates on local point-to-point links. Maximum survival probability routes for present and future positions are input into a mobility control module that determines robot trajectories restricted to configurations that ensure the probability of network survival stays above a minimum reliability level. Local trajectory planning is proposed for simple environments and global planning is proposed for complex surroundings. The three proposed components are integrated and tested in experiments run in two different environments. Experimental results show successful navigation with continuous end-to-end connectivity.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "290", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "309", "date_publication": "Fri May 10 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "13528374", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Wed May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "pages": "290 - 309", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Jonathan Fink", "Alejandro Ribeiro", "Vijay Kumar"], "keywords": ["Gaussian processes", "mobile ad hoc networks", "mobility management (mobile radio)", "motion control", "multi-robot systems", "navigation", "path planning", "probability", "radio links", "robust control", "telecommunication traffic", "trajectory control", "wireless channels", "Gaussian process models", "ad-hoc network", "autonomous robot teams", "data traffic", "data transmissions", "end-to-end routes", "mobility", "motion control", "motion planning", "navigation", "point-to-point communication links", "probability", "robot trajectories", "robust control", "stochastic process", "wireless channels", "wireless propagation environment", "Planning", "Robot kinematics", "Routing", "Shadow mapping", "Trajectory", "Wireless communication", "Routing protocols", "autonomous agents", "path planning", "wireless networks", ""], "arnumber": "6514922"}
