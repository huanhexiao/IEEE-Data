Each machine can perform a job with different efficiency levels that entail different costs and amount of resources required. The MGAP was introduced in the context of large manufacturing systems as a more general variant of the well-known generalized assignment problem, where a single efficiency level is associated with each machine. In this paper, we propose a branch-and-cut algorithm whose core is an exact separation procedure for the multiple-choice knapsack polytope induced by the capacity constraints and single-level execution constraints. A computational experience on a set of benchmark instances is reported, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "475", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "479", "date_publication": "Wed Jul 24 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "13646559", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Jul 25 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "pages": "475 - 479", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Pasquale Avella", "Maurizio Boccia", "Igor Vasilyev"], "keywords": ["knapsack problems", "manufacturing systems", "MGAP", "assignment cost minimization", "benchmark instances", "branch-and-cut algorithm", "capacity constraint", "computational experience", "manufacturing systems", "multilevel generalized assignment problem", "multiple-choice knapsack polytope", "separation procedure", "single-level execution constraints", "Benchmark testing", "Context awareness", "Heuristic algorithms", "Linear programming", "Partitioning algorithms", "Search problems", "Generalized assignement problem", "branch-and-cut", "exact separation", ""], "arnumber": "6567888"}
