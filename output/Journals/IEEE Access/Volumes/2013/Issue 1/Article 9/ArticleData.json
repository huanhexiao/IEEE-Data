Often, the lab experiments are outdated. The Virtual Labs project addresses the issue of lack of good lab facilities, as well as trained teachers, by making remote experimentation possible. The pedagogy is student-centric. The Virtual Labs project has also developed a novel methodology for field trials, outreach, and quality control. Virtual Labs also provide tremendous cost advantage. The Virtual Labs project is a wonderful example of an open educational resource developed by a multiinstitution multidiscipline project team. Over 100000 students are currently using the online labs under the Virtual Labs project. Many of these labs are being accessed outside the regular lab hours.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "718", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "725", "date_publication": "Fri Oct 18 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "13875248", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 24 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "pages": "718 - 725", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Ranjan Bose"], "keywords": ["Internet", "computer aided instruction", "laboratories", "Internet-based remote experimentation", "Virtual Labs project", "engineering education", "laboratory experiments", "open educational resource", "student-centric pedagogy", "Educational institutions", "Electrical engineering", "Internet", "Manuals", "Mathematical model", "Software", "Information and communications technology (ICT)", "internet-based experimentation", "open educational resources (OERs)", "remote experimentation", ""], "arnumber": "6637004"}
