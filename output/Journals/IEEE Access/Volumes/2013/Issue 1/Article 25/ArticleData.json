This paper presents a scientific approach to experimentation on objects that are units of designers' behavior and is aimed at solving project tasks in conceptual design. The proposed approach is based on specifying the behavior units as precedents and pseudo-code programming of experiments' plans. Reasoning used by designers in the experiments is registered in a question-answer form. Experimenting is supported by a specialized toolkit.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "488", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "504", "date_publication": "Thu Jul 25 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "13696629", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Wed Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "pages": "488 - 504", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Petr Sosnin"], "keywords": ["formal specification", "question answering (information retrieval)", "reasoning about programs", "behavior unit specification", "conceptual design", "designer activity simulation", "pseudocode programming", "question answer form", "reasoning", "scientifically experimental approach", "software intensive system", "Cognition", "Complexity theory", "Natural languages", "Programming", "Real-time systems", "Software", "Software engineering", "Conceptual designing", "designers' behavior", "experience", "precedent", "question-answering", "software intensive system", ""], "arnumber": "6568867"}
