The improvement achieved in sensitivity of a dual diaphragm structure over the single diaphragm category is verified through experiments. An experimental setup for efficiently assessing the dynamic performances of the pressure transducers is presented. Eventually, the improved sensitivity concedes improvement in precision and resolution of the instrument. While the vibrating wire transducer based pressure sensors always show better dynamic performances over others, the present dual diaphragm structure offers improved sensitivity, which adds to their dynamic performances and overall performance characteristics.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "252", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "257", "date_publication": "Fri May 10 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "13517737", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Mon May 20 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "pages": "252 - 257", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Akin Cellatoglu", "Karuppanan Balasubramanian2"], "keywords": ["diaphragms", "pneumatic systems", "pressure measurement", "pressure sensors", "pressure transducers", "vibration measurement", "wires", "dual diaphragm structure", "pressure transducer", "vibrating wire pneumatic pressure sensor sensitivity", "vibrating wire transducer", "Microcontrollers", "Periodic structures", "Pressure measurement", "Sensitivity", "Transducers", "Vibrations", "Wires", "Diaphragm structure", "dynamic pressure sensor", "sensitivity improvement", "time constant measurement", ""], "arnumber": "6514908"}
