The key is to establish a knowledge-based connection between these two data sets for the tight fusion of different imaging modalities. Our scheme consists of four inter-related elements: 1) segmentation; 2) initial guess generation; 3) CT image reconstruction; and 4) MRI image reconstruction. Our experiments show that, aided by the image obtained from one imaging modality, even with highly under-sampled data, we can better reconstruct the image of the other modality. This approach can be potentially useful for a simultaneous CT-MRI system.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1359", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1363", "date_publication": "Thu Nov 20 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14762987", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Nov 26 00:00:00 EST 2014", "pages": "1359 - 1363", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Yang Lu", "Jun Zhao", "Ge Wang"], "keywords": ["biomedical MRI", "computerised tomography", "image fusion", "image reconstruction", "image segmentation", "medical image processing", "MRI", "computed tomography", "edge-guided dual-modality image reconstruction", "image fusion", "image segmentation", "imaging modality", "magnetic resonance imaging", "Biomedical image processing", "Computed tomography", "Image processing", "Image reconstruction", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "$l_{1}$ -norm minimization", "CT-MRI system", "image reconstruction", "l -norm minimization", "multi-modality imaging", ""], "arnumber": "6962888"}
