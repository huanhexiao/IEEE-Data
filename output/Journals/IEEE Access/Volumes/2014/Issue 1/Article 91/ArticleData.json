By using the properties of Gaussian functions, an approximate approach to the APP detection is devised with the idea that, in the computation of the APP of each symbol, the remaining symbols are distinguished based on their contributions to the APP of the concerned symbol, and the symbols with less contributions are approximated as (continuous) Gaussian variables [hence the name partial Gaussian approximation (PGA)] to reduce the computational complexity. The connection between the PGA detector and the reduced dimension maximum a posteriori detector (RDMAP) is investigated. It is shown that, PGA is equivalent to RDMAP, but it has a complexity much lower than that of RDMAP, i.e., PGA can be regarded as an efficient implementation of RDMAP. In addition, the application of PGA in intersymbol interference (ISI) channel equalization is also investigated. We show that PGA allows further significant complexity reduction by exploiting the circulant structure of the system transfer matrix, which makes PGA very attractive in handling severe ISI channels with large memory length.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "427", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "436", "date_publication": "Tue May 06 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14316374", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Wed May 21 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "427 - 436", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Qinghua Guo", "Defeng (David) Huang", "Sven Nordholm", "Jiangtao Xi", "Li Ping"], "keywords": ["Gaussian processes", "MIMO communication", "approximation theory", "computational complexity", "equalisers", "intersymbol interference", "maximum likelihood detection", "probability", "APP detection", "Gaussian variables", "ISI channel equalization", "MIMO detection", "PGA detector", "RDMAP", "a posteriori probability detection", "circulant structure", "coded communication system", "computational complexity reduction", "intersymbol interference", "large memory length", "multiple input multiple output detection", "partial Gaussian approximation", "reduced dimension maximum a posteriori detector", "soft-in soft-out detection", "system transfer matrix", "transmitted symbols", "Approximation methods", "Communication systems", "Computational complexity", "Detectors", "Electronics packaging", "Encoding", "Gaussian approximation", "Gaussian functions", "LMMSE detection", "RDMAP", "Soft-in soft-out detection", "turbo equalization", ""], "arnumber": "6810827"}
