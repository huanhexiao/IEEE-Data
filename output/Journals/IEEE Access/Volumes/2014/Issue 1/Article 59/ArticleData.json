The global roll-out of 4G long-term evolution is underway, ideally enabling ubiquitous broadband Internet access. Mobile network operators, however, are currently facing an exponentially increasing demand for network capacity, necessitating densification of cellular base stations (keywords: small cells and heterogeneous networks) and causing a strongly deteriorated interference environment. Coordination among transmitters and receivers to mitigate and/or exploit interference is hence seen as a main path toward 5G mobile networks. We provide an overview of existing coordinated beamforming strategies for interference mitigation in broadcast and interference channels. To gain insight into their ergodic behavior in terms of signal to interference and noise ratio as well as achievable transmission rate, we focus on a simplified but representative scenario with two transmitters that serve two users. This analysis provides guidelines for selecting the best performing method depending on the particular transmission situation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "930", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "946", "date_publication": "Fri Aug 29 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14578401", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Sep 09 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "930 - 946", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Stefan Schwarz", "Markus Rupp"], "keywords": ["Internet", "cellular radio", "mobile computing", "radiofrequency interference", "5G cellular networks", "cellular base stations", "coordinated multipoint beamforming strategies", "ergodic behavior", "interference channels", "interference mitigation", "mobile network operators", "network capacity", "signal to interference ratio", "signal to noise ratio", "ubiquitous broadband Internet access", "Broadband communication", "Cellular networks", "Interference", "Internet", "Long Term Evolution", "Mobile communication", "Mobile computing", "Network architecture", "Transmitters", "MMSE receiver", "Multiple-input multiple-output", "beamforming", "coordinated multipoint transmission", "ergodic transmission rate", "linear transceivers", "multiuser gains", ""], "arnumber": "6888496"}
