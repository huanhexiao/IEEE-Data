This paper analyzes the challenges of building a simulation platform for 5G considering the emerging new technologies and network architectures. Based on the overview of evaluation methodologies issued for 4G candidates, challenges in 5G evaluation are formulated. Additionally, a cloud-based two-level framework of system-level simulator is proposed to validate the candidate technologies and fulfill the promising technology performance identified for 5G.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1553", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1561", "date_publication": "Mon Dec 22 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14860606", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 07 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "1553 - 1561", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Ying Wang", "Jing Xu", "Lisi Jiang"], "keywords": ["5G mobile communication", "performance evaluation", "5G wireless networks", "long term evolution-4G cellular network", "network architecture", "performance evaluation", "system level simulations", "5G mobile communication", "Cellular networks", "Long Term Evolution", "Performance evaluation", "System level design and analysis", "Wireless communication", "5G", "performance evaluation", "system-level simulations", "two-level simulator", ""], "arnumber": "6994948"}
