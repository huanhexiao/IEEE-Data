Type 1 vacation is taken after the server has exhaustively served all the customers in the system, where the number of customers served is at least one. Type 2 vacation is taken when the server returns from a vacation and finds no customer waiting. Each type of vacation can be interrupted when the number of customers in the system reaches two predefined thresholds, where each vacation type has a different threshold. It is assumed that service times and vacation durations are exponentially distributed with different means. We present a steady-state solution of the system under two vacation interruption policies.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1384", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1395", "date_publication": "Thu Nov 20 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14784879", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Dec 03 00:00:00 EST 2014", "pages": "1384 - 1395", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Olubukola A.
