In this paper, we present an analytical model to calculate the total time it takes for a GPU to retire one frame on a given benchmark. The model also estimates the total retirement time for the same frame on a different GPU using regression estimation model. The model consists of two stages. The first stage entails establishing the measured baseline for a specific frame on a given graphics card, and the second stage entails adjusting the measured baseline and estimating the time it takes to process all draw calls for the same frame on a different graphics card. The model considers the impact of pipeline bottlenecks to process a specific frame, estimates the minimum time it takes to process that frame, and reparameterize the baseline for a different graphics card to calculate new frame retirement times at two different memory frequencies. We used Amdahl's law model to estimate frame retirement time for a different graphics card at higher memory frequencies based on the new adjusted measured baseline with error margin is <;5%.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1177", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1186", "date_publication": "Wed Oct 15 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14679158", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Oct 21 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "1177 - 1186", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Joseph A.
