The CNT tube allows for flexible placement and distribution of X-ray focal spots in a system. Using a CNT tube, a computed tomography (CT) system with a noncircular geometry and a nonrotating gantry can be created. The noncircular CT geometry can be optimized around a specific imaging problem, utilizing the flexibility of CNT multibeam X-ray tubes to achieve the optimal focal spot distribution for the design constraints of the problem. Iterative reconstruction algorithms provide flexible CT reconstruction to accommodate the noncircular geometry. Compressed sensing-based iterative reconstruction algorithms apply a sparsity constraint to the reconstructed images that can partially account for missing angular coverage due to the noncircular geometry. In this paper, we present a laboratory prototype CT system that uses CNT multibeam X-ray tubes; a rectangular, nonrotating imaging geometry; and an accelerated compressed sensing-based iterative reconstruction algorithm. We apply a total variation minimization as our sparsity constraint. We present the advanced CNT multibeam tubes and show the stability and flexibility of these new tubes. We also present the unique imaging geometry and discuss the design constraints that influenced the specific system design. The reconstruction method is presented along with an overview of the acceleration of the algorithm to near real-time reconstruction. We demonstrate that the prototype reconstructed images have image quality comparable with a conventional CT system. The prototype is optimized for airport checkpoint baggage screening, but the concepts developed may apply to other application-specific CT imaging systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "971", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "981", "date_publication": "Thu Aug 28 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14578400", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Sep 10 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "971 - 981", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Brian Gonzales", "Derrek Spronk", "Yuan Cheng", "Andrew W.
