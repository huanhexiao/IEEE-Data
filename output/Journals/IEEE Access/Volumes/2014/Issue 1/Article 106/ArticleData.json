In this paper, we survey the role of agent-based modeling within hospital settings, where agent-based models investigate patient flow and other operational issues as well as the dynamics of infection spread within hospitals or hospital units. While there is a rich history of simulation and modeling of hospitals and hospital units, relatively little work exists, which applies agent-based models to this context.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "227", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "233", "date_publication": "Wed Mar 26 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14219281", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 07 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "227 - 233", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Marcia R.
