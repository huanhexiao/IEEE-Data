The term big data was coined to capture the meaning of this emerging trend. In addition to its sheer volume, big data also exhibits other unique characteristics as compared with traditional data. For instance, big data is commonly unstructured and require more real-time analysis. This development calls for new system architectures for data acquisition, transmission, storage, and large-scale data processing mechanisms. In this paper, we present a literature survey and system tutorial for big data analytics platforms, aiming to provide an overall picture for nonexpert readers and instill a do-it-yourself spirit for advanced audiences to customize their own big-data solutions. First, we present the definition of big data and discuss big data challenges. Next, we present a systematic framework to decompose big data systems into four sequential modules, namely data generation, data acquisition, data storage, and data analytics. These four modules form a big data value chain. Following that, we present a detailed survey of numerous approaches and mechanisms from research and industry communities. In addition, we present the prevalent Hadoop framework for addressing big data challenges. Finally, we outline several evaluation benchmarks and potential research directions for big data systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "652", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "687", "date_publication": "Tue Jun 24 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14429402", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Jul 10 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "652 - 687", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Han Hu", "Yonggang Wen", "Tat-Seng Chua", "Xuelong Li"], "keywords": ["Big Data", "data acquisition", "data analysis", "data communication", "public domain software", "storage management", "Big Data analytics", "Big Data value chain", "Hadoop", "data acquisition", "data generation", "data storage", "data transmission", "industry community", "large-scale data processing mechanism", "scalable system", "sequential modules", "system architecture", "technology tutorial", "Big data", "Data acquisition", "Information analysis", "Medical services", "Real-time systems", "Scalability", "Sensor phenomena and characterization", "Sensor systems", "Supply chain management", "Big data analytics", "Hadoop", "cloud computing", "data acquisition", "data analytics", "data storage", ""], "arnumber": "6842585"}
