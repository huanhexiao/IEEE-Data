Analyzing and collecting features for the model creation process from the network traffic traces is a time-consuming and error-prone task. Automating these procedures are a challenge. The research problem discussed in this paper concentrates on the analysis and collection of features from the network traffic traces for the model development process, by automating the analysis and collection. The proposed system of this paper, called MGtoolV2, supports the model development process through the automation of collection and analysis in the actual model creation procedures. The model development process aims to enhance the development of a model by reducing the development cost and time. The proposed tool automatically creates large sets of models according to the network traffic traces and minimizes the errors of manual modeling. The experiments conducted with MGtoolV2 indicate that the tool is able to create the models from the traffic traces cost effectively. MGtoolV2 is able to unify similarities between packets, to create very detailed models describing specific information, and to raise the abstraction level of the created models. The research is based on the constructive method of the related publications and technologies, and the results are established from the testing, validation, and analysis of the implemented MGtoolV2.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "142", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "152", "date_publication": "Tue Feb 25 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14134127", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Mar 06 00:00:00 EST 2014", "pages": "142 - 152", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Marko M\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e4", "Tomi R\u00e4ty"], "keywords": ["IP networks", "telecommunication traffic", "transport protocols", "IP network", "MGtoolV2", "TCP", "abstraction level", "automatic model creation", "constructive method", "error-prone task", "manual modeling", "model creation process", "model development process", "network monitoring", "network traffic flows", "network traffic sets", "network traffic traces", "IP networks", "Mathematical model", "Monitoring", "Ports (Computers)", "Protocols", "Telecommunication traffic", "XML", "MSC", "Network monitoring", "Pcap", "XML", "modeling", ""], "arnumber": "6748008"}
