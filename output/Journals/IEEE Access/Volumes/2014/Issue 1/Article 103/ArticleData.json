The method is validated by successful estimation of sludge volume in oil tanks using simulated and real data. First, as a demonstration of the conventional system, image reconstruction algorithms are used for tank-bottom sludge profile imaging for symmetrical and asymmetrical sludge profiles, where the setup is modeled in finite difference time domain method with reduced dimensions of the tank. A 3-D imaging algorithm is used for the 3-D simulation of real life targets. To get the volume of the sludge, ASIN-based UWB radar system is then applied and its effectiveness is demonstrated. In this framework, to get information about the sludge at the bottom of industrial tank, first, a scheme is proposed to differentiate between two sets of data which correspond to two different set of volumes. This method is validated using a commercial UWB kit, in which, practical experiments were performed. The data obtained is visualized using multidimensional scaling procedure and analyzed. Then, regression analysis using radial basis function artificial neuron network is performed, so that given a particular data, it can be predicted that, to which volume it best corresponds.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "290", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "300", "date_publication": "Tue Mar 25 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14235708", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 15 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "290 - 300", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Santu Sardar", "Amit Kumar Mishra"], "keywords": ["computerised monitoring", "data visualisation", "finite difference time-domain analysis", "image reconstruction", "oil technology", "radar imaging", "radial basis function networks", "radiotelemetry", "regression analysis", "sludge treatment", "tanks (containers)", "ultra wideband radar", "3D imaging algorithm", "3D life target simulation", "ASIN-based UWB radar system", "application specific instrument", "asymmetrical sludge profiles", "finite difference time domain method", "image reconstruction algorithms", "industrial oil tanks", "industrial tank", "multidimensional scaling procedure", "radial basis function artificial neuron network", "regression analysis", "scattering signatures", "sludge monitoring", "sludge volume estimation", "symmetrical sludge profiles", "tank-bottom sludge profile imaging", "ultrawideband radar system", "Environmental factors", "Finite difference methods", "Fuel storage", "Monitoring", "Oil tanks", "Radar imaging", "Sludge treatment", "Time-domain analysis", "Ultra wideband radar", "ANN", "ASIN", "FDTD", "MDS", "RBF", "UWB", "regression analysis", ""], "arnumber": "6778048"}
