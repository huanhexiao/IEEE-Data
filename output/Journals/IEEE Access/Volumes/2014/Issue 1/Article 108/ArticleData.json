Short times-to-market require cost reduction by maximizing software reuse. Openness for new innovations presumes a flexible development platform and fast software engineering practices. User satisfaction assumes situation-based applications of high quality. The main contribution of this paper is the piecemeal service engineering (PSE) approach developed for and tested in application development for smart spaces. The intent of PSE is to maximize the reuse of existing knowledge of business and design practices and existing technical assets in the development of new smart-space applications. Business knowledge is mostly informal and domain-dependent, but architectural knowledge is generic, at least semiformal, and represented in principles, ontologies, patterns, and rules that together form a reusable architectural knowledge base for fast smart-space application development. The PSE facilitates the incremental development of intelligent applications by supporting abstraction, aggregation, and adaptability in smart-space development.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "199", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "214", "date_publication": "Mon Mar 03 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14178523", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 18 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "199 - 214", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Eila Ovaska", "Jarkko Kuusij\u00e4rvi"], "keywords": ["software architecture", "software quality", "software reusability", "business knowledge", "collaboration-based service engineering", "intelligent application piecemeal development", "piecemeal service engineering approach", "smart spaces", "software development", "software reuse", "user satisfaction", "Adaptation models", "Context modeling", "Knowledge based systems", "Ontologies", "Smart design", "Software development", "Unified modeling language", "Service engineering", "architectural knowledge", "dynamic", "reuse", "semantic", ""], "arnumber": "6754122"}
