It assumes that a message is queued for transmission either periodically or sporadically. However, a message can also be queued both periodically and sporadically using mixed transmission mode implemented by several higher level protocols for CAN that are used in the automotive industry. We extend the existing analysis for CAN to support any higher level protocol for CAN that uses periodic, sporadic, and mixed transmission of messages in the systems where some nodes implement priority queues, whereas others implement FIFO queues. In order to provide a proof of concept, we implement the extended analysis in a free tool, conduct an automotive-application case study, and perform comparative evaluation of the extended analysis with the existing analysis.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "365", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "380", "date_publication": "Tue Apr 22 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14279486", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Thu May 08 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "365 - 380", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Saad Mubeen", "Jukka M\u00e4ki-Turja", "Mikael Sj\u00f6din"], "keywords": ["controller area networks", "protocols", "queueing theory", "real-time systems", "scheduling", "CAN", "FIFO queues", "automotive industry", "automotive-application case study", "controller area network", "first in first out queues", "higher level protocols", "mixed message transmission", "mixed messages", "mixed transmission mode", "periodic message transmission", "priority queues", "sporadic message transmission", "worst case response-time analysis", "Automotive engineering", "Controller area networks", "Protocols", "Queueing analysis", "Timing", "CAN protocol", "Controller area network", "FIFO queues", "distributed embedded systems", "mixed messages", "real-time network", "response-time analysis", "schedulability analysis", ""], "arnumber": "6803860"}
