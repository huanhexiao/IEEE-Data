In this paper, we describe a new way of thinking about cognitive control that embodies two basic components: learning and planning, both of which are based on two notions: 1) two-state model of the environment and the perceptor and 2) perception-action cycle, which is a distinctive characteristic of the cognitive dynamic system. Most importantly, it is shown that the cognitive control learning algorithm is a special form of Bellman's dynamic programming. Distinctive properties of the new algorithm include the following: 1) optimality of performance; 2) algorithmic convergence to optimal policy; and 3) linear law of complexity measured in terms of the number of actions taken by the cognitive controller on the environment. To validate these intrinsic properties of the algorithm, a computational experiment is presented, which involves a cognitive tracking radar that is known to closely mimic the visual brain. The experiment illustrates two different scenarios: 1) the impact of planning on learning curves of the new cognitive controller and 2) comparison of the learning curves of three different controllers, based on dynamic optimization, traditional (Q) -learning, and the new algorithm. The latter two algorithms are based on the two-state model, and they both involve the use of planning.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "698", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "710", "date_publication": "Wed Jun 25 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14446358", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Jul 15 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "698 - 710", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Mehdi Fatemi", "Simon Haykin"], "keywords": ["cognition", "computational complexity", "dynamic programming", "Bellman dynamic programming", "Q-learning", "algorithmic convergence", "cognitive control learning algorithm", "cognitive dynamic system", "cognitive tracking radar", "dynamic optimization", "human brain", "learning curves", "linear complexity law", "perception-action cycle", "performance optimality", "prefrontal cortex", "two-state model", "visual brain", "Brain modeling", "Cognition", "Complexity theory", "Control systems", "Dynamic programming", "Heuristic algorithms", "Perception", "Radar tracking", "Bayesian filtering", "Cognitive dyanamic systems", "Shannon's entropy", "cognitive control", "dynamic programming", "entropic state", "explore/exploit tradeoff", "learning", "planning", "two-state model", ""], "arnumber": "6843352"}
