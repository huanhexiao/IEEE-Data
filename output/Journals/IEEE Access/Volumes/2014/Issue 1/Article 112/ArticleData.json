In this use case, it provides highly parallel calculations of normalization intergrals and log (likelihood) sums. A key feature of the design is its use of the Thrust library to manage all parallel kernel launches. This allows GooFit to execute on any architecture for which Thrust has a backend, currently, including CUDA for nVidia GPUs and OpenMP for single- and multicore CPUs. Running on an nVidia C2050, GooFit executes 300 times more quickly for a complex high energy physics problem than does the prior (algorithmically equivalent) code running on a single CPU core. The design and implementation choices, discussed in detail, can help to guide developers of other highly parallel, compute-intensive libraries.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "160", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "176", "date_publication": "Thu Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14149652", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 11 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "160 - 176", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Rolf E.
