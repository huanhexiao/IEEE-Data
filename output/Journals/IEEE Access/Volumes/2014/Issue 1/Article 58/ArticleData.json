Previous studies mainly focus on time division duplexing (TDD) systems, which are more amenable to practical implementations due to channel reciprocity. However, there are many frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems deployed worldwide. Consequently, it is of great importance to investigate the design and performance of FDD massive MIMO systems. To reduce the overhead of channel estimation in FDD systems, a two-stage precoding scheme was recently proposed to decompose the precoding procedure into intergroup precoding and intragroup precoding. The problem of user grouping and scheduling thus arises. In this paper, we first propose three novel similarity measures for user grouping based on weighted likelihood, subspace projection, and Fubini-Study, respectively, as well as two novel clustering methods, including hierarchical and K-medoids clustering. We then propose a dynamic user scheduling scheme to further enhance the system throughput once the user groups are formed. The load balancing problem is considered when few users are active and solved with an effective algorithm. The efficacy of the proposed schemes are validated with theoretical analysis and simulations.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "947", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "959", "date_publication": "Fri Aug 29 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14578404", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Sep 10 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "947 - 959", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Yi Xu", "Guosen Yue", "Shiwen Mao"], "keywords": ["MIMO communication", "channel estimation", "dynamic scheduling", "frequency division multiplexing", "group theory", "pattern clustering", "precoding", "resource allocation", "FDD massive MIMO systems", "Fubini-Study", "K-medoids clustering", "TDD systems", "channel estimation", "channel reciprocity", "clustering methods", "dynamic user scheduling scheme", "frequency division duplexing systems", "hierarchical clustering", "intergroup precoding", "intragroup precoding", "load balancing problem", "massive multiple-input multiple-output system", "subspace projection", "system throughput", "time division duplexing systems", "two-stage precoding scheme", "user grouping", "weighted likelihood", "Channel estimation", "Clustering methods", "Costs", "Design methodology", "Dynamic scheduling", "Finite difference methods", "Frequency conversion", "MIMO", "Throughtput", "Time division multiplexing", "Weight measurement", "Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)", "frequency division duplexing (FDD)", "load balancing", "precoding", "user grouping", ""], "arnumber": "6888467"}
