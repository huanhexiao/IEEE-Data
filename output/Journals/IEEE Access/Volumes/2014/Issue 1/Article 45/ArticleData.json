The proposal creates several virtual networks that are composed of functions specialized for particular services on a mobile communication network and efficiently forwards a sequence of signaling messages to the appropriate virtual networks. Using a prototype system, this paper verifies the overheads costs of the proposal that are incurred during the inspection of packet application headers needed to appropriately forward signaling messages as well as the overheads incurred when replicating state information from one virtual network to another. This paper shows that the proposal can reduce the signaling processing load by ~25% under certain assumptions.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1076", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1084", "date_publication": "Tue Sep 23 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14641278", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Oct 03 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "1076 - 1084", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Manabu Ito", "Kiyohide Nakauchi", "Yozo Shoji", "Nozomu Nishinaga", "Yoshinori Kitatsuji"], "keywords": ["IP networks", "mobile radio", "multimedia communication", "virtual private networks", "virtualisation", "EPC", "IMS", "IP multimedia subsystem", "evolved packet core", "fifth-generation mobile communication system", "packet application header inspection", "service-specific network virtualization", "signaling messages sequence", "signaling processing load reduction", "state information replication", "virtual networks", "IP networks", "Inspection", "Mobile communication", "Multimedia communication", "Network virtualization", "Resource management", "Servers", "Virtualization", "Evolved packet core", "IP multimedia subsystem", "evolved packet core", "mobile communication network", "network virtualization", "next virtualization", "signaling", ""], "arnumber": "6907942"}
