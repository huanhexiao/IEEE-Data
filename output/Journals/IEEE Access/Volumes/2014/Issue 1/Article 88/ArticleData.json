First, the images are treated in order to improve their pixel to pixel correspondence and reduce illumination differences. After that, stereo matching is addressed using different methods with emphasis on local ones like the sum of absolute distances and normalized cross correlation. Other state-of-the-art approaches are also considered. Then, and for every pixel, different features are computed from the input stereo image and the initially found depth map. Afterward, boosting and neural networks, as classification methods, are used to handle occlusion and enhance stereo matching by finding the erroneous disparity values. These values are then corrected through a completion stage. The accuracy of the proposed implementation improves on the problem in an efficient manner. A timing analysis of the method is provided to validate the real time performance. This paper further clarifies some of the possible developments based on various discussions.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "485", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "499", "date_publication": "Thu May 22 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14326271", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Fri May 23 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "485 - 499", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Mohammed Baydoun", "Mohamad Adnan Al-Alaoui"], "keywords": ["image classification", "image matching", "learning (artificial intelligence)", "neural nets", "stereo image processing", "absolute distances sum", "boosting", "classification methods", "depth map", "erroneous disparity values", "method timing analysis", "neural networks", "normalized cross correlation", "occlusion", "pixel-to-pixel correspondence", "stereo matching problem", "Classification", "IEEE standards", "Real-time systems", "Stereo matching", "Stereo matching", "classification", "real time", ""], "arnumber": "6819773"}
