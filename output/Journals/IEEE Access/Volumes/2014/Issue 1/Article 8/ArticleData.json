RANaaS is a novel concept introduced recently, which enables the partial centralization of RAN functionalities depending on the actual needs as well as on network characteristics. In the view of future definition of 5G systems, this cloud-based design is an important solution in terms of efficient usage of network resources. The aim of this paper is to give a vision of the advantages of the RANaaS, to present its benefits in terms of energy efficiency and to propose a consistent system-level power model as a reference for assessing innovative functionalities toward 5G systems. The incremental benefits through the years are also discussed in perspective, by considering technological evolution of IT platforms and the increasing matching between their capabilities and the need for progressive virtualization of RAN functionalities. The description is complemented by an exemplary evaluation in terms of energy efficiency, analyzing the achievable gains associated with the RANaaS paradigm.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1586", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1597", "date_publication": "Thu Dec 18 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14846112", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 13 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "1586 - 1597", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Dario Sabella", "Antonio de Domenico", "Efstathios Katranaras", "Muhammad Ali Imran", "Marco di Girolamo", "Umer Salim", "Massinissa Lalam", "Konstantinos Samdanis", "Andreas Maeder"], "keywords": ["5G mobile communication", "Long Term Evolution", "cloud computing", "energy conservation", "mobile computing", "radio access networks", "5G infrastructure", "LTE-advanced networks", "RANaaS implementation", "architectural evolution", "cloud-based design", "commodity hardware", "energy efficiency aspects", "incremental benefits", "innovative functionalities", "network characteristics", "network resources", "radio-access-network-as-a-service implementation", "system-level power model", "technological evolution", "5G mobile communication", "Cloud computing", "Energy efficiency", "Long Term Evolution", "Mobile communication", "Network architecture", "Radio access network", "Virtualization", "5G", "Cloud-RAN", "Energy Efficiency", "Energy efficiency", "LTE-Advanced", "LTE-advanced", "RAN-as-a-Service", "RAN-as-a-service", "Radio Access Networks", "SG", "Wireless Communication", "cloud-RAN", "power model", "radio access networks", "wireless communication", ""], "arnumber": "6990725"}
