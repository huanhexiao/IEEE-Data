This new architecture opens up opportunities for algorithms that require centralized processing. However, efficient implementation of the algorithms presents a number of challenges the most critical being latency, fronthaul capacity, and resource control. In this paper, we propose a software-defined radio-based architecture that addresses these problems and can be implemented on a cloud of general purpose computing platforms. We also present the practical implementation of Cloud-RAN running on an off-the-shelf server to validate the flexibility of the architecture. The implementation is able to realize various cellular networks, including heterogeneous networks, distribute-antenna systems, and transmission schemes, such as transmit antenna selection and open-loop transmit diversity.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1205", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1212", "date_publication": "Wed Oct 01 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14679162", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Oct 22 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "1205 - 1212", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Yihenew Dagne Beyene", "Riku J\u00e4ntti", "Kalle Ruttik"], "keywords": ["cellular radio", "cloud computing", "radio access networks", "software radio", "transmitting antennas", "base stations", "baseband processing units", "cellular networks", "cellular technology", "cloud radio access network", "cloud-RAN architecture", "distribute-antenna systems", "fronthaul capacity", "heterogeneous networks", "indoor DAS", "open-loop transmit diversity", "radio front-ends", "resource control", "software-defined radio-based architecture", "transmitting antenna selection", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Base stations", "Baseband", "Cellular networks", "Cloud computing", "Computer architecture", "Microprocessors", "Open loop systems", "Radio access networks", "Servers", "Cloud RAN", "cloud RAN", "distributed-antenna systems", "software-defined radio", ""], "arnumber": "6914529"}
