The FMC allows mobile users to be always connected via the optimal data anchor and mobility gateways to access their data and services from optimal data centers. The FMC was initially designed to support user mobility, particularly in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) networks. In this paper, FMC is further tailored to support mobile users connected from other network types, such as public WiFi or Asymetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) fixed networks. Indeed, this paper presents an implementation of FMC based on local/identifier separation protocol (LISP), whereby the main goal is to render FMC independent from the underlying technology. To simplify further the deployment, all FMC entities (including LISP entities) are virtualized considering the network function virtualization principle.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1340", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1347", "date_publication": "Thu Sep 25 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14762988", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Nov 24 00:00:00 EST 2014", "pages": "1340 - 1347", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Adlen Ksentini", "Tarik Taleb", "Farouk Messaoudi"], "keywords": ["cloud computing", "digital subscriber lines", "internetworking", "mobile computing", "protocols", "virtualisation", "wireless LAN", "3GPP networks", "3rd generation partnership project networks", "ADSL", "FMC", "LISP entities", "LISP-based implementation", "asymmetric digital subscriber line", "data access", "fixed networks", "follow me cloud concept", "local-identifier separation protocol", "mobile users", "mobility gateways", "network function virtualization principle", "optimal data anchor", "optimal data centers", "public WiFi", "service mobility", "user mobility", "3G mobile communication", "Cloud computing", "Data centers", "IEEE 802.11 Standards", "Logic gates", "Mobile communication", "Mobile computing", "Virtualization", "Follow me cloud", "LISP", "QoS", "network function virtualization (NFV)", "testbed", ""], "arnumber": "6910231"}
