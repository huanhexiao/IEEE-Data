This paper combines generalized functions (specifically the Dirac delta function), superdense time, modal models, and constructive semantics to get a rich, flexible, efficient, and rigorous approach to modeling such systems. It shows that many physical scenarios that have been problematic for modeling techniques manifest as nonconstructive models, and that constructive versions of some of the models properly reflect uncertainty in the behavior of the physical systems that plausibly arise from the principles of the underlying physics. This paper argues that these modeling difficulties are not reasonably solved by more detailed continuous models of the underlying physical phenomena. Such more detailed models simply shift the uncertainty to other aspects of the model. Since such detailed models come with a high computational cost, there is little justification in using them unless the goal of modeling is specifically to understand these more detailed physical processes. All models in this paper are implemented in the Ptolemy II modeling and simulation environment and made available online.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "797", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "821", "date_publication": "Thu Aug 07 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 21 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "797 - 821", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Edward A.
