To fully realize this potential, there is a need for a common way to abstract the heterogeneity of devices so that their functionality can be represented as a virtual computing platform. To this end, we present novel semantic level interoperability architecture for pervasive computing and IoTs. There are two main principles in the proposed architecture. First, information and capabilities of devices are represented with semantic web knowledge representation technologies and interaction with devices and the physical world is achieved by accessing and modifying their virtual representations. Second, global IoT is divided into numerous local smart spaces managed by a semantic information broker (SIB) that provides a means to monitor and update the virtual representation of the physical world. An integral part of the architecture is a resolution infrastructure that provides a means to resolve the network address of a SIB either using a physical object identifier as a pointer to information or by searching SIBs matching a specification represented with SPARQL. We present several reference implementations and applications that we have developed to evaluate the architecture in practice. The evaluation also includes performance studies that, together with the applications, demonstrate the suitability of the architecture to real-life IoT scenarios. In addition, to validate that the proposed architecture conforms to the common IoT-A architecture reference model (ARM), we map the central components of the architecture to the IoT-ARM.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "856", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "873", "date_publication": "Mon Aug 18 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14541712", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 28 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "856 - 873", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Jussi Kiljander", "Alfredo D\u2019elia", "Francesco Morandi", "Pasi Hyttinen", "Janne Takalo-Mattila", "Arto Ylisaukko-Oja", "Juha-Pekka Soininen", "Tullio Salmon Cinotti"], "keywords": ["Internet of Things", "knowledge representation", "open systems", "semantic Web", "Internet of Things", "IoT-A architecture reference model", "IoT-ARM", "SIB", "SPARQL", "local smart spaces", "pervasive computing", "physical object identifier", "resolution infrastructure", "semantic Web knowledge representation technologies", "semantic information broker", "semantic level interoperability architecture", "virtual representations", "Computer architecture", "Context awareness", "Interoperability", "Pervasive computing", "Resource description framework", "Semantics", "Sensors", "Internet of Things", "RDF", "SPARQL", "pervasive computing", "semantic interoperability", "system architecture", ""], "arnumber": "6879461"}
