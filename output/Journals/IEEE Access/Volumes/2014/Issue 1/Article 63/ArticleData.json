We define a graph-based optimization framework based on interference condition between any two users in the network assuming they are served on similar resources. Furthermore, we prove that the proposed framework obtains a tight lower bound for conventional weighted sum-rate maximization problem in practical scenarios. Thereafter, we decompose the optimization problem into dynamic graph-partitioning-based subproblems across different subchannels and provide an optimal solution using branch-and-cut approach. Subsequently, due to high complexity of the solution, we propose heuristic algorithms that display near optimal performance. At the final stage, we apply cluster-based resource allocation per subchannel to find candidate users with maximum total weighted sum-rate. A case study on networked small cells is also presented with simulation results showing a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art multicell scheduling benchmarks in terms of outage probability as well as average cell throughput.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "897", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "908", "date_publication": "Thu Aug 21 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14578405", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Sep 08 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "897 - 908", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Emmanouil Pateromichelakis", "Mehrdad Shariat", "Atta Ul Quddus", "Rahim Tafazolli"], "keywords": ["cellular radio", "frequency division multiple access", "graph theory", "optimisation", "radiofrequency interference", "resource allocation", "scheduling", "telecommunication network reliability", "OFDMA-based small cell networks", "branch-and-cut approach", "cell throughput", "cluster-based resource allocation", "downlink intercell interference", "graph-based multicell scheduling framework", "graph-based optimization framework", "heuristic algorithms", "multicell scheduling benchmarks", "outage probability", "subchannels", "weighted sum-rate maximization problem", "Clustering algorithms", "Complexity theory", "Downlink", "Graph theory", "Heuristic algorithms", "Interference", "Multi-cell scheduling", "Resource management", "Scheduling", "Interference coordination", "graph partitioning", "small cells", ""], "arnumber": "6881614"}
