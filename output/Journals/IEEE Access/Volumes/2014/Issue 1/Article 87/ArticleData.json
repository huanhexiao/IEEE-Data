It has gained huge successes in a broad area of applications such as speech recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing. With the sheer size of data available today, big data brings big opportunities and transformative potential for various sectors; on the other hand, it also presents unprecedented challenges to harnessing data and information. As the data keeps getting bigger, deep learning is coming to play a key role in providing big data predictive analytics solutions. In this paper, we provide a brief overview of deep learning, and highlight current research efforts and the challenges to big data, as well as the future trends.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "514", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "525", "date_publication": "Fri May 16 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14326272", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Thu May 29 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "514 - 525", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Xue-Wen Chen", "Xiaotong Lin"], "keywords": ["Big Data", "data analysis", "learning (artificial intelligence)", "Big Data", "deep learning", "machine learning", "pattern recognition", "predictive analytics solutions", "Big data", "Data processing", "Information analysis", "Machine learning", "Natural language processing", "Pattern recognition", "Classifier design and evaluation", "feature representation", "machine learning", "neural nets models", "parallel processing", ""], "arnumber": "6817512"}
