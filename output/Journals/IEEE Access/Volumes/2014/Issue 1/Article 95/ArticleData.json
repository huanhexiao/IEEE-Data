The learning of a DBN starts with pretraining a series of the RBMs followed by fine-tuning the whole net using backpropagation. Generally, the sequential implementation of both RBMs and backpropagation algorithm takes significant amount of computational time to process massive data sets. The emerging big data learning requires distributed computing for the DBNs. In this paper, we present a distributed learning paradigm for the RBMs and the backpropagation algorithm using MapReduce, a popular parallel programming model. Thus, the DBNs can be trained in a distributed way by stacking a series of distributed RBMs for pretraining and a distributed backpropagation for fine-tuning. Through validation on the benchmark data sets of various practical problems, the experimental results demonstrate that the distributed RBMs and DBNs are amenable to large-scale data with a good performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "395", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "403", "date_publication": "Wed Apr 23 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14297289", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Mon May 12 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "395 - 403", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Kunlei Zhang", "Xue-Wen Chen"], "keywords": ["Big Data", "Boltzmann machines", "backpropagation", "parallel programming", "Big Data learning", "DBN", "MapReduce", "RBM", "distributed backpropagation algorithm", "distributed computing", "distributed learning paradigm", "large-scale deep belief nets", "restricted Boltzmann machines", "Belief networks", "Boltzmann machines", "Computational modeling", "Data handling", "Data storage systems", "Distributed computing", "Information management", "Parallel programming", "Big data", "Hadoop", "MapReduce", "deep belief net (DBN)", "deep learning", "restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM)", ""], "arnumber": "6804632"}
