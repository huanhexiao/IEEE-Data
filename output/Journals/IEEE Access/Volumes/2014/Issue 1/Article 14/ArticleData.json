To support the ever-growing cloud computing needs, the number of servers in today's data centers are increasing exponentially, which in turn leads to enormous challenges in designing an efficient and cost-effective data center network. With data availability and security at stake, the issues with data center networks are more critical than ever. Motivated by these challenges and critical issues, many novel and creative research works have been proposed in recent years. In this paper, we investigate in data center networks and provide a general overview and analysis of the literature covering various research areas, including data center network interconnection architectures, network protocols for data center networks, and network resource sharing in multitenant cloud data centers. We start with an overview on data center networks and together with its requirements navigate the data center network designs. We then present the research literature related to the aforementioned research topics in the subsequent sections. Finally, we draw the conclusions.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1481", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1496", "date_publication": "Thu Dec 18 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14815903", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 30 00:00:00 EST 2014", "pages": "1481 - 1496", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Ting Wang", "Zhiyang Su", "Yu Xia", "Mounir Hamdi"], "keywords": ["cloud computing", "computer centres", "cloud computing", "cloud-based services", "data center networking", "enterprise information technology", "large-scale data centers", "multitenant cloud data centers", "network resource sharing", "Cloud computing", "Computer architecture", "Computer security", "Data centers", "Design methodology", "Information technology", "Large-scale systems", "Resource management", "Servers", "Architecture", "Data Center Networks", "Data center networks", "Resource Sharing", "architecture", "network protocols", "resource sharing", ""], "arnumber": "6990724"}
