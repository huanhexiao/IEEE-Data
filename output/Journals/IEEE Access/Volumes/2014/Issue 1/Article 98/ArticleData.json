Because of changing orders, understanding the schedule and output is a constant challenge when using a traditional manual schedule, particularly among manufacturers that produce various products. The multiobjective optimization genetic algorithm (MOGA) is a relatively superior method of solving multiobjective optimization problems; therefore, we used a MOGA to solve flexible job-shop problems for a middle-scale screw manufacturer in Taiwan. For solving the problems of incorrect jobs assign and diversity problem of traditional genetic algorithm (GA) caused by encoding method when applying traditional GA in the flexible manufacturing environment, a refined GA was proposed. Two-phase test has performed for proposed approach, using a classical benchmark of distributed and flexible jobs-shop scheduling problem, and 80 set of work orders, the empirical results indicated that the proposed model yielded substantial savings, regardless of the total order completion time, machine retooling rate, and average machine load rate.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "356", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "364", "date_publication": "Wed Apr 23 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14279485", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Tue May 06 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "356 - 364", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Tung-Kuan Liu", "Yeh-Peng Chen", "Jyh-Horng Chou"], "keywords": ["fasteners", "flexible manufacturing systems", "genetic algorithms", "job shop scheduling", "MOGA", "Taiwan", "average machine load rate", "distributed job-shop scheduling problem", "diversity problem", "encoding method", "flexible job-shop problems", "flexible manufacturing environment", "incorrect jobs assign problem", "machine retooling rate", "middle-scale screw manufacturer", "multiobjective optimization genetic algorithm approach", "multiobjective optimization scheduling system", "single-objective job shop scheduling method", "total order completion time", "two-phase test", "Genetic algorithms", "Job shop scheduling", "Manufacturing processes", "Optimization", "Screws", "Flexible jobs shop", "multiobjective optimization genetic algorithms", "refined genetic algorithms", "screw manufacturer", ""], "arnumber": "6804631"}
