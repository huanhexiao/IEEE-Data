Our approach harnesses the power of video game development engines to provide an urban 3-D ray-based model for exploration and analysis of multipath channels for a wide frequency range in different complex outdoor and indoor scenarios. Game technologies offer a variety of options for exploiting the capabilities of graphical processing units and provide high performance in computing time with accurate results for channel modeling in current and future wireless technologies. We show the usefulness of this approach using our 3-D ray-based system in different applications.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1652", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1659", "date_publication": "Thu Nov 13 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14860602", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Jan 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "1652 - 1659", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Andr\u00e9s Navarro Cadavid", "Dinael Guevara Ibarra", "Sebastian Londo\u00f1o Salcedo"], "keywords": ["channel estimation", "computer games", "indoor radio", "multipath channels", "ray tracing", "telecommunication computing", "wireless channels", "3D video game technology", "graphical processing unit", "multipath channel estimation modeling", "urban 3D ray-based model", "video game development engine", "wireless technology", "Computational modeling", "Computer graphics", "Game theory", "Graphics processing units", "Physics", "Ray tracing", "Three-dimensional displays", "Ray-tracing", "channel estimation", "game engines", "graphic technologies", "ray-tracing", ""], "arnumber": "6955706"}
