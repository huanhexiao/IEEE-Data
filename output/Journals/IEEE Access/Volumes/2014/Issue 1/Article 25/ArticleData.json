Current developments in PHY security are often based on the assumption of perfect channel state information (CSI). In this paper, both security and reliability performance for the downlink cloud radio access network with optimal remote radio heads (RRHs) node selection are investigated in a practical scenario by considering channel estimation (CE) errors. In particular, a three-phase transmission scheme is proposed and the linear minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimation method is utilized to obtain the CSI. Based on the CSI estimates and the statistics of CE errors, the outage probability and intercept probability are derived in closed-form expression to evaluate the security and reliability performance, respectively. In addition, two possible cases (with or without intercepting signals from baseband unit) are considered for the eavesdropper. It is found that the suggested optimal RRHs selection scheme outperforms the nonselection scheme, and that the increasing number of RRHs can lower the outage probability as well as the intercept probability. It is also shown that there exists an optimal training number to minimize the sum of the outage probability and intercept probability. Finally, simulation results are provided to corroborate our proposed studies.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1348", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1358", "date_publication": "Thu Nov 13 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14762990", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Nov 26 00:00:00 EST 2014", "pages": "1348 - 1358", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Jia You", "Zhangdui Zhong", "Gongpu Wang", "Bo Ai"], "keywords": ["channel estimation", "cloud computing", "mean square error methods", "radio access networks", "telecommunication network reliability", "telecommunication security", "CE errors", "CSI", "MMSE estimation method", "PHY security", "baseband unit", "channel estimation errors", "closed-form expression", "downlink cloud radio access network", "eavesdropper", "intercept probability", "linear minimum mean-square error estimation method", "node selection", "optimal RRH selection scheme", "optimal remote radio heads", "outage probability", "perfect channel state information", "physical layer security", "reliability performance analysis", "security performance analysis", "three-phase transmission scheme", "wireless communication networks", "Channel capacity", "Channel estimation", "Decoding", "Network security", "Performance evaluation", "Power outages", "Signal to noise ratio", "Wireless communication", "Channel estimation error", "intercept probability", "outage probability", "outage probability.", "remote radio head selection", "secure wireless communication", "security-reliability performance analysis", ""], "arnumber": "6955788"}
