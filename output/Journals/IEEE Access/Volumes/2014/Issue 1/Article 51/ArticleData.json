Both emission-type tomographic imaging modalities use external X-rays to stimulate secondary emissions, either light or secondary X-rays, which are then acquired for tomographic reconstruction. These modalities surpass the limits of sensitivity in current X-ray imaging and have the potential of enabling X-ray imaging to extract molecular imaging information. These new modalities also promise to break through the spatial resolution limits of other in vivo molecular imaging modalities. This paper reviews the development of X-ray luminescence and X-ray fluorescence CT and their relative merits. The discussion includes current problems and future research directions and the role of these modalities in future molecular imaging applications.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1051", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1061", "date_publication": "Thu Sep 04 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14620827", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Sep 24 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "1051 - 1061", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Moiz Ahmad", "Guillem Pratx", "Magdalena Bazalova", "Lei Xing"], "keywords": ["X-ray fluorescence analysis", "computerised tomography", "image reconstruction", "medical image processing", "reviews", "X-ray fluorescence computed tomography", "X-ray luminescence computed tomography", "emission type tomographic imaging modality", "functional imaging", "molecular imaging", "review", "tomographic reconstruction", "Computed tomography", "Emissions", "Luminescence", "Optical imaging", "Optical sensors", "Stimulated emission", "X-ray imaging", "Biomedical imaging", "computed tomography", "molecular imaging", "x-ray tomography", ""], "arnumber": "6891106"}
