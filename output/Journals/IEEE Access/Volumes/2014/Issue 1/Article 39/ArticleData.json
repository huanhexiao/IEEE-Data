We start by reviewing the requirements of future mobile networks, called 5G, followed by a discussion on emerging network concepts for 5G network architecture. Then, an overview of C-RAN and related works are presented. As a significant scenario of a 5G system, the ultra dense network deployment based on C-RAN is discussed with focuses on flexible backhauling, automated network organization, and advanced mobility management. Another import feature of a 5G system is the long-term coexistence of multiple radio access technologies (multi-RATs). Therefore, we present some directions and preliminary thoughts for future C-RAN-supporting Multi-RATs, including joint resource allocation, mobility management, as well as traffic steering and service mapping.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1187", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1195", "date_publication": "Wed Oct 01 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14679159", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Oct 22 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "1187 - 1195", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Rui Wang", "Honglin Hu", "Xiumei Yang"], "keywords": ["mobility management (mobile radio)", "telecommunication traffic", "5G mobile networks", "5G network architecture", "C-RAN supporting MultiRAT", "advanced mobility management", "automated network organization", "capital expenditure", "cloud radio access network", "explosive capacity demand", "flexible backhauling", "joint resource allocation", "mobile traffic", "operating expenditure", "service mapping", "traffic steering", "ultra dense network deployment", "Cellular networks", "Cloud computing", "Mobile communication", "Mobile radio mobility management", "Next generation networking", "Radio access networks", "Radio communication", "Resource management", "5G", "C-RAN", "Multi-RATs", "UDN", "multi-RATs", ""], "arnumber": "6914530"}
