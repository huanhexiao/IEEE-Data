In particular, the proposed MIMO architecture considers exploiting a deep-subwavelength propagation channel made of graphene. This allows us to increase the number of transmitted symbol streams, while using a deep-subwavelength arrangement of individual plasmonic nanotransmit/receive elements in which the spacing between the transmitters and/or the receivers is tens of times smaller than the wavelength. This exclusive benefit is achieved with the aid of the phenomenon of graphene plasmons, where graphene offers the extremely confined and low-loss plasmon propagation. Hence, the proposed graphene-based MIMO system is capable of combating the fundamental limitations imposed on the classic MIMO configuration. We also present a novel graphene-specific channel adaptation technique, where the chemical potential of the graphene channel is varied to improve the power of the received signals.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1240", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1247", "date_publication": "Mon Oct 20 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14688653", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "1240 - 1247", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Shinya Sugiura", "Hideo Iizuka"], "keywords": ["MIMO communication", "graphene", "plasmons", "radio transceivers", "radiowave propagation", "wireless channels", "C", "chemical potential", "deep-subwavelength MIMO", "deep-subwavelength propagation channel", "graphene plasmon phenomenon", "graphene-based nanoscale communication channel", "graphene-specific channel adaptation technique", "high-rate nanoscale wireless communication", "individual plasmonic nanotransmit-receive element", "low-loss plasmon propagation", "multiple-input multiple-output concept", "radio receiver", "radio transmitter", "symbol stream transmission", "wireless transceiver", "Antenna arrays", "Graphene", "MIMO", "Nanoscale devices", "Plasmons", "Transceivers", "Transmitters", "Wireless communication", "Correlation", "MIMO", "chemical potential", "deep subwavelength", "diffraction limit", "graphene", "nanoscale communication", "surface plasmon polariton", ""], "arnumber": "6930729"}
