In this paper, we develop methods for robust and resilient six-transistor-cell static random access memory (6T-SRAM) designs that mitigate the effects of device and circuit parameter variations. Our interdisciplinary effort involves: 1) using our own recently developed VAR-TX model [1] to illustrate the impact of interdie (also known as die-to-die, D2D) and intradie (also know as within-die, WID) process and operation variations - namely threshold voltage (Vth), gate length (L), and supply voltage (Vdd) - on future different 16-nm architectures and 2) using modified versions of other well-received models to illustrate the impact of variability due to temperature, negative bias temperature instability, aging, and so forth, on existing and next-generation technology nodes. Our goal in combining modeling techniques is to help minimize all major types of variability and to consequently predict and optimize speed and yield for the next generation 6T-SRAMs.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "577", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "601", "date_publication": "Wed May 14 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14351703", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Jun 06 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "577 - 601", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Jeren Samandari-Rad", "Matthew Guthaus", "Richard Hughey"], "keywords": ["SRAM chips", "ageing", "integrated circuit modelling", "integrated circuit reliability", "integrated circuit yield", "negative bias temperature instability", "6T-SRAM", "VAR-TX model", "circuit parameter variations", "integrated circuit reliability", "integrated circuit yield", "interdie process variation", "intradie process variation", "negative bias temperature instability", "next generation SRAM design", "six-transistor-cell static random access memory", "size 16 nm", "Energy efficiency", "Integrated circuit reliability", "Next generation networking", "Performance evaluation", "Reliability engineering", "SRAM chips", "Threshold voltage", "Voltage measurement", "16-nm", "6T-SRAM", "access-time", "aging", "optimum architecture", "reliability", "type of variations", "variability", "yield", ""], "arnumber": "6815646"}
