Each algorithm has specific input data requirements and makes certain assumptions that may or may not hold true in a particular fault location scenario. Without a detailed understanding of the principle of each fault-locating method, choosing the most suitable fault location algorithm can be a challenging task. This paper, therefore, presents the theory of one-ended (simple reactance, Takagi, modified Takagi, Eriksson, and Novosel et al.) and two-ended (synchronized, unsynchronized, and current-only) impedance-based fault location algorithms and demonstrates their application in locating real-world faults. The theory details the formulation and input data requirement of each fault-locating algorithm and evaluates the sensitivity of each to the following error sources: 1) load; 2) remote infeed; 3) fault resistance; 4) mutual coupling; 5) inaccurate line impedances; 6) DC offset and CT saturation; 7) three-terminal lines; and 8) tapped radial lines. From the theoretical analysis and field data testing, the following criteria are recommended for choosing the most suitable fault-locating algorithm: 1) data availability and 2) fault location application scenario. Another objective of this paper is to assess what additional information can be gleaned from waveforms recorded by intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) during a fault. Actual fault event data captured in utility networks is exploited to gain valuable feedback about the transmission network upstream from the IED device, and estimate the value of fault resistance.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "537", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "557", "date_publication": "Tue May 13 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14347724", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 02 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "537 - 557", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Swagata Das", "Surya Santoso", "Anish Gaikwad", "Mahendra Patel"], "keywords": ["electric impedance", "fault location", "power transmission faults", "CT saturation", "DC offset", "IED device", "data availability", "distance-faults", "fault resistance", "impedance-based fault location algorithms", "inaccurate line impedances", "intelligent electronic devices", "load sources", "mutual coupling", "remote infeed", "tapped radial lines", "three-terminal lines", "transmission networks", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Estimation", "Fault currents", "Fault location", "Impedance", "Mutual coupling", "Resistance", "Synchronization", "Transmission lines", "Fault location", "impedance-measurement", "intelligent electronic devices (IED)", "power system faults", "power system reliability", "transmission line measurements", ""], "arnumber": "6814841"}
