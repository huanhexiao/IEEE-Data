This paper presents a systematic data-driven process for detecting and diagnosing faults in the regenerative braking system of hybrid electric vehicles. The diagnostic process involves signal processing and statistical techniques for feature extraction, data reduction for implementation in memory-constrained electronic control units, and variety of fault classification methodologies to isolate faults in the regenerative braking system. The results demonstrate that highly accurate fault diagnosis is possible with the classification methodologies. The process can be employed for fault analysis in a wide variety of systems, ranging from automobiles to buildings to aerospace systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1225", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1239", "date_publication": "Mon Oct 13 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14688651", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Oct 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "1225 - 1239", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Chaitanya Sankavaram", "Bharath Pattipati", "Krishna R.
