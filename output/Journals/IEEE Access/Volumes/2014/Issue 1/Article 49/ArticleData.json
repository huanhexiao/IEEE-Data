In principle, a cylinder-by-cylinder control approach could compensate for air, residuals, and temperature imbalance. However, in order to fully benefit from closed-loop combustion control, it is necessary to obtain feedback signals from each engine cylinder to reconstruct the pressure trace. Therefore, cylinder imbalance is an issue that can be detected in a laboratory environment, wherein each engine cylinder is instrumented with a dedicated pressure transducer. This paper describes the framework and preliminary results of a model-based estimation approach to predict the individual pressure traces in a multicylinder engine relying on a very restricted sensor set, namely, a crankshaft speed sensor, a single production-grade pressure sensor. The objective of the estimator is to reconstruct the complete pressure trace during an engine cycle with sufficient accuracy to allow for detection of cylinder to cylinder imbalances. Starting from a model of the engine crankshaft dynamics, an adaptive sliding mode observer is designed to estimate the cylinder pressure from the crankshaft speed fluctuation measurement. The results obtained by the estimator are compared with experimental data obtained on a four-cylinder diesel engine.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1085", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1091", "date_publication": "Wed Sep 17 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14609412", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Sep 26 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "1085 - 1091", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Ahmed Al-Durra"], "keywords": ["adaptive control", "closed loop systems", "combustion", "control system synthesis", "diesel engines", "observers", "pressure transducers", "sensors", "shafts", "torque", "variable structure systems", "velocity measurement", "EGR", "adaptive sliding mode observer design", "air distribution", "closed-loop combustion control", "combustion modes", "combustion process", "crankshaft speed fluctuation measurement", "crankshaft speed sensor", "cylinder-by-cylinder control approach", "engine crankshaft dynamics", "engine cycle", "engine cylinder pressure imbalance", "feedback signals", "four-cylinder diesel engine", "laboratory environment", "model-based estimation approach", "multicylinder engine", "pressure trace", "pressure transducer", "production-grade pressure sensor", "sensor set", "temperature imbalance compensation", "torque", "Combustion", "Compensation", "Engine cylinders", "Engines", "Pressure control", "Sliding mode control", "Temperature control", "Torque control", "Engine", "adaptive observer", "cylinder pressure imbalance", "parameter uncertainty", "sliding mode observer", ""], "arnumber": "6901187"}
