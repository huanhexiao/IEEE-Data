CAPTCHAs, tests for distinguishing human and computer users, have traditionally been popular; however, they face particular difficulties in a modern mobile environment because most of them rely on keyboard input and have language dependencies. This paper proposes a novel image-based CAPTCHA that combines the touch-based input methods favored by mobile devices with genetically optimized face detection tests to provide a solution that is simple for humans to solve, ready for worldwide use, and provides a high level of security by being resilient to automated computer attacks. In extensive testing involving over 2600 users and 40000 CAPTCHA tests, fgCAPTCHA demonstrates a very high human success rate while ensuring a 0% attack rate using three well-known face detection algorithms.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "473", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "484", "date_publication": "Tue Apr 29 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14326270", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Thu May 22 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "473 - 484", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Brian M.
