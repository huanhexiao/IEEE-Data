These applications demand high network throughput that easily exceeds the capability of the low-power 802.15.4 radios most commonly used in today's sensor nodes. To address this issue, this paper investigates an energy-efficient approach to supplementing an 802.15.4-based wireless sensor network with high bandwidth, high power, longer range radios, such as 802.11. Exploiting a key observation that the high-bandwidth radio achieves low energy consumption per bit of transmitted data due to its inherent transmission efficiency, we propose a hybrid network architecture that utilizes an optimal density of dual-radio (802.15.4 and 802.11) nodes to augment a sensor network having only 802.15.4 radios. We present a cross-layer mathematical model to calculate this optimal density, which strikes a delicate balance between the low energy consumption per transmitted bit of the high-bandwidth radio and low sleep power of the 802.15.4. Experimental results obtained using a wireless sensor network testbed reveal that our architecture improves the average energy per bit, time elapsed before the first node drains its battery, time elapsed before half of the nodes drain their batteries, and end-to-end delay by significant margins compared with a network having only 802.15.4.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1281", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1306", "date_publication": "Wed Oct 22 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14705174", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Nov 05 00:00:00 EST 2014", "pages": "1281 - 1306", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["A.
