This paper addresses three main problems: 1) how to increase the computational and energy efficiency of computers and to reduce their size and weight; 2) how to achieve human-like versatility in intelligence; and 3) likewise for human-like adaptability in intelligence. Regarding the first problem, the SP system has the potential for substantial gains in computational efficiency, with corresponding cuts in energy consumption and the bulkiness of computers: 1) by reducing the size of data to be processed; 2) by exploiting statistical information that the system gathers as an integral part of how it works; and 3) via a new version of Donald Hebb's concept of a cell assembly. Toward human-like versatility in intelligence, the SP system has strengths in unsupervised learning, natural language processing, pattern recognition, information retrieval, several kinds of reasoning, planning, problem solving, and more, with seamless integration among structures and functions. The SP system's strengths in unsupervised learning and other aspects of intelligence may help in achieving human-like adaptability in intelligence via: 1) one-trial learning; 2) learning of natural language; 3) learning to see; 4) building 3-D models of objects and of a robot's surroundings; 5) learning regularities in the workings of a robot and in the robot's environment; 6) exploration and play; 7) learning major skills; and 8) learning via demonstration. Also discussed are how the SP system may process parallel streams of information, generalization of knowledge, correction of over-generalizations, learning from dirty data, how to cut the cost of learning, and reinfor- ements and motivations.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1629", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1651", "date_publication": "Thu Dec 18 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14860604", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 21 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "1629 - 1651", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["James Gerard Wolff"], "keywords": ["energy conservation", "learning by example", "mobile robots", "unsupervised learning", "3D model building", "SP intelligence theory", "SP machine", "autonomous robots", "cell assembly", "computers computational efficiency", "computers energy efficiency", "dirty data learning from", "energy consumption", "human-like intelligence adaptability", "human-like intelligence versatility", "information retrieval", "knowledge generalization", "learning via demonstration", "mobile robots", "natural language processing", "one-trial learning", "over-generalization correction", "parallel information streams", "pattern recognition", "planning", "problem solving", "reasoning", "statistical information", "unsupervised learning", "Artificial intelligence", "Cognitive science", "Computational efficiency", "Data compression", "Learning systems", "Man machine interfaces", "Mobile communication", "Mobile robots", "Pattern recognition", "Power supplies", "Robots", "Unsupervised learning", "Artificial intelligence", "cognitive science", "data compression", "pattern recognition", "robots", "unsupervised learning", ""], "arnumber": "6990727"}
