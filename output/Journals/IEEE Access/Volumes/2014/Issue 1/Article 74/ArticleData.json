Since this complexity cannot be handled by traditional approaches, this paper focuses on the partitioning of RF transceiver systems and on the implementation of application-specific components to introduce an advanced multiprocessor system-on-chip interface and control architecture which is able to fulfill the requirements of future RF transceiver integrations. The proposed framework demonstrates a high degree of scalability, flexibility, and reusability. Consequently, the time to market for products can be reduced and fast adaptations to the requirements of the market are feasible. In addition, the developed application-specific components achieve improved or at least equivalent performance results compared with common architectures while the silicon area can be reduced. This characteristic has positive effects on the costs as well as on the power consumption of the RF transceiver.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "771", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "787", "date_publication": "Fri Aug 01 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14512367", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Aug 12 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "771 - 787", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Siegfried Brandst\u00e4tter", "Mario Huemer"], "keywords": ["data communication", "mobile radio", "multiprocessing systems", "radio transceivers", "system-on-chip", "telecommunication power management", "MPSoC control architecture", "MPSoC interface", "application-specific component implementation", "data transmission", "mobile communication networks", "mobile communication standards", "multiprocessor system-on-chip interface", "multistandard RF transceivers", "power consumption", "radio frequency transceivers", "Baseband", "Mobile communication", "Process control", "Radio frequency", "Transceivers", "MPSoC", "RF transceiver", "application-specific NoC design", "application-specific processor design", "hard real-time controlling", "on-chip communication", "on-chip synchronization", ""], "arnumber": "6870422"}
