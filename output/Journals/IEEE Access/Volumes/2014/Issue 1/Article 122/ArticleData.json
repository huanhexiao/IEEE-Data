When obstacles are encountered, wheels are lifted, moved ahead in a stepping-like motion, and lowered back down, thereby allowing the PMV to advance further. In our previous paper, we discussed the principle of the gait algorithm used by our PMV, in which wheels are utilized as legs to negotiate obstacles. In the original algorithm, when the wheels encountered terrain that might require leg motion to traverse, the system determined whether such motion was applicable and, if it was, orchestrated a series of leg motions. However, there were terrains that could not be negotiated using the original algorithm. In this paper, we propose an improved gait algorithm, in which when the vehicle encounters terrain intractable by leg motion with its current posture, the vehicle changes its posture until it can traverse that terrain. We verified the effectiveness of the improved gait algorithm through a variety of mobility tests with a passenger. In addition, we present numerical data on the range of terrain topologies that could be negotiated by the proposed algorithm.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "26", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "39", "date_publication": "Thu Jan 02 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "13998445", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Jan 09 00:00:00 EST 2014", "pages": "26 - 39", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Shuro Nakajima"], "keywords": ["mobile robots", "motion control", "position control", "road vehicles", "wheelchairs", "PMV", "RT-Mover type personal mobility vehicle", "gait algorithm", "leg motion mechanism", "mobility performance", "numerical data", "obstacle negotiation", "stepping-like motion", "terrain topology", "vehicle posture change", "wheel lifting", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Collision avoidance", "Gait recognition", "Intelligent vehicles", "Legged locomotion", "Mobile robots", "Motion control", "Performance evaluation", "Terrain mapping", "Wheelchairs", "Gait algorithm", "mobility performance", "obstacle", "personal mobility vehicle", "robotic wheelchair", "rough terrain", "terrain topology", ""], "arnumber": "6697815"}
