The purpose of this paper is to investigate this phenomena and establish whether the safety margin of aging tests can be increased by changes in manufacture or test procedures. Using a number of cable types with different compositions and dimensions, the evolution of the absolute values of tensile strength and elongation at break upon aging was obtained. The results show that the major changes in mechanical properties happen within the first 24-48 h. This finding is valid both for ethylene vinylsilane copolymers and for grafted silane systems. In general, the effect is more pronounced for the 100\u00b0C compatibility test. Statistical analysis shows that insulation crosslinked in a hot waterbath will exhibit this behavior to a lesser extent, thus increasing the safety margin in aging tests, compared with ambient curing. This paper demonstrates that preconditioning at 70\u00b0C has no significant impact on aging properties. In addition, only small variations in mechanical properties were seen when changing the process parameters. It is concluded that further crosslinking is the principal cause of the phenomena under investigation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "177", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "182", "date_publication": "Thu Mar 06 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14149651", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 11 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "177 - 182", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Stefan Hellstr\u00f6m", "Fredrik Bergfors", "Paul Laurenson", "James Robinson"], "keywords": ["ageing", "elongation", "fracture mechanics", "polymer blends", "statistical analysis", "tensile strength", "tensile testing", "aging testing", "breakage", "compatibility testing", "elongation", "ethylene vinylsilane copolymers", "grafted silane systems", "hot waterbath", "insulation crosslinking", "mechanical properties", "silane crosslinked polyethylene cable insulation", "statistical analysis", "technical standards", "temperature 100 degC", "temperature 70 degC", "tensile strength", "test procedures", "time 24 h to 48 h", "Aging", "Cable insulation", "Mechanical factors", "Polyethylene", "Power cables", "Mechanical properties", "silane crosslinking", "thermal aging", ""], "arnumber": "6758336"}
