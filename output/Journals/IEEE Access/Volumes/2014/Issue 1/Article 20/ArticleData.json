Furthermore, development of these methodologies will kick open the door to new biology and chemistry that has been logistically intractable previously. Nanopore technology will place molecular and sub-molecular analysis within the reach of the typical bench-top scientist or clinical lab-no longer limited to genomics or mass spectrometry specialists. Moreover, the prospects for synthetic biology-using nanopores to program or reprogram cells-are promising as well, but have been examined only at the level of a single cell, so far.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1396", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1408", "date_publication": "Thu Nov 20 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14784880", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Dec 05 00:00:00 EST 2014", "pages": "1396 - 1408", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Winston Timp", "Allison M.
