Miniaturization and beamwidth enhancement of a patch antenna are the two main areas to be discussed. By folding the edge of the radiating patch with loading slots, the size of the patch antenna is 44.8% smaller than a conventional half wavelength patch, which allows it to be accommodated inside handsets easily. Wide beamwidth is obtained by surrounding the patch with a dielectric substrate and supporting the antenna by a metallic block. A measured half power beamwidth of 124\u00b0 is achieved. The impedance bandwidth of the antenna is over 10%, and the 3-dB axial ratio bandwidth is 3.05%. The proposed antenna covers a wide elevation angle and complete azimuth range. A parametric study of the effect of the metallic block and the surrounding dielectric substrate on the gain at a low elevation angle and the axial ratio of the proposed antenna are presented.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1521", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1529", "date_publication": "Thu Dec 18 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14860609", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 06 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "1521 - 1529", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Ka Ming Mak", "Hau Wah Lai", "Kwai Man Luk", "Chi Hou Chan"], "keywords": ["5G mobile communication", "antenna radiation patterns", "microstrip antennas", "circularly polarized patch antenna", "complete azimuth range", "dielectric substrate", "fifth-generation mobile phones", "future 5G mobile phones", "impedance bandwidth", "metallic block", "wide elevation angle", "5G mobile communication", "Bandwidth", "Dielectric substrates", "Mobile communication", "Mobile handsets", "Patch antennas", "Polarization", "Antenna radiation patterns", "beamwidth enhancement", "microstrip patch antennas", "satellite antennas", "size reduction", ""], "arnumber": "6985762"}
