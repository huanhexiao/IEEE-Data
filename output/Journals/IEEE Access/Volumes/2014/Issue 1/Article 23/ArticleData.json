These power outages have significant impacts on other infrastructure dependent on electric power and on the population living in the impacted area. Efficient and effective emergency response planning within power utilities, other utilities dependent on electric power, private companies, and local, state, and federal government agencies benefit from accurate estimates of the extent and spatial distribution of power outages in advance of an approaching hurricane. A number of models have been developed for predicting power outages in advance of a hurricane, but these have been specific to a given utility service area, limiting their use to support wider emergency response planning. In this paper, we describe the development of a hurricane power outage prediction model applicable along the full U.S. coastline using only publicly available data, we demonstrate the use of the model for Hurricane Sandy, and we use the model to estimate what the impacts of a number of historic storms, including Typhoon Haiyan, would be on current U.S. energy infrastructure.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1364", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1373", "date_publication": "Fri Nov 07 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14762989", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Nov 26 00:00:00 EST 2014", "pages": "1364 - 1373", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Seth David Guikema", "Roshanak Nateghi", "Steven M.
