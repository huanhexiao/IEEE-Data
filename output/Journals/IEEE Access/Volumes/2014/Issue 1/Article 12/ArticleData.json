However, D2D communications can also serve as a technology component for providing public protection and disaster relief (PPDR) and national security and public safety (NSPS) services. In the United States, for example, spectrum has been reserved in the 700-MHz band for an LTE-based public safety network. The key requirement for the evolving broadband PPDR and NSPS services capable systems is to provide access to cellular services when the infrastructure is available and to efficiently support local services even if a subset or all of the network nodes become dysfunctional due to public disaster or emergency situations. This paper reviews some of the key requirements, technology challenges, and solution approaches that must be in place in order to enable LTE networks and, in particular, D2D communications, to meet PPDR and NSPS-related requirements. In particular, we propose a clustering-procedure-based approach to the design of a system that integrates cellular and ad hoc operation modes depending on the availability of infrastructure nodes. System simulations demonstrate the viability of the proposed design. The proposed scheme is currently considered as a technology component of the evolving 5G concept developed by the European 5G research project METIS.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1510", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1520", "date_publication": "Thu Dec 18 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14860608", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 06 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "1510 - 1520", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Gabor Fodor", "Stefan Parkvall", "Stefano Sorrentino", "Pontus Wallentin", "Qianxi Lu", "Nadia Brahmi"], "keywords": ["Long Term Evolution", "radio equipment", "D2D communications", "LTE based public safety network", "NSPS services", "ad hoc operation modes", "broadband PPDR", "cellular operation modes", "cellular services", "device-to-device communications", "emergency situations", "long-term evolution", "national security", "national security and public safety", "public disaster", "public protection and disaster relief", "public safety", "technology component", "5G mobile communication", "Broadband communication", "Disasters", "Emergency services", "Long Term Evolution", "Mobile communication", "National security", "Safety", "Wireless communications", "ad hoc networks", "cellular networks", "mobile communications", ""], "arnumber": "6985517"}
