They offer promising opportunities in terms of system performance, but they pose unique challenges in terms of source and system technologies. Several academic and industrial teams have proposed a variety of concepts and developed some unique prototypes. We present a broad review of multisource systems. We also discuss X-ray source components and challenges. We close with our perspective on the future prospects of multisource imaging.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1568", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1585", "date_publication": "Fri Oct 17 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14846111", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 14 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "1568 - 1585", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Vasile Bogdan Neculaes", "Peter M.
