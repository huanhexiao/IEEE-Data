The device is novel due to its innovative design. It is a new type of reflective oximeter, which has a concave structure for housing the optical source and sensor. The neo-reflective sensor module of the device is designed to send the sensor data to a nearby intelligent mobile phone using wireless data transmission. The pulse oximeter has been developed and calibrated, and the calibration curve was analyzed. The innovative design of this pulse oximeter would enable the user to wear the low-cost device on one wrist continuously throughout the day, without the inconvenience of a conventional finger pulse oximeter.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1562", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1567", "date_publication": "Thu Dec 18 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14860603", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Jan 20 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "1562 - 1567", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Grantham Pang", "Chao Ma"], "keywords": ["bioelectric potentials", "blood", "body sensor networks", "calibration", "chemical sensors", "data communication", "optical sensors", "oximetry", "telemedicine", "calibration curve analysis", "finger pulse oximeter", "intelligent mobile phone", "neo-reflective wrist pulse oximeter", "noninvasive medical device", "optical sensor", "optical source", "oxygen saturation level measurement", "person blood", "pulse rate measurement", "wireless data transmission", "Biomedical optical imaging", "Blood pressure", "Optical reflection", "Optical saturation", "Optical sensors", "Oximeters", "Pulse measurement", "Wearable computers", "Wrists", "Biomedical sensor", "biomedical sensor", "blood oxygen saturation", "pulse oximetry", "reflective oximetry", "wrist oximeter", ""], "arnumber": "6990728"}
