This array antenna is proposed and designed with a standard printed circuit board process to be suitable for integration with radio frequency/microwave circuitry. The proposed structure employs four circular-shaped DD patch radiator antenna elements fed by a 1-to-4 Wilkinson power divider. To improve the array radiation characteristics, a ground structure based on a compact uniplanar electromagnetic bandgap unit cell has been used. The DD patch shows better radiation and total efficiencies compared with the metallic patch radiator. For further gain improvement, a dielectric layer of a superstrate is applied above the array antenna. The measured impedance bandwidth of the proposed array antenna ranges from 27 to beyond 32 GHz for a reflection coefficient (S11) of less than -10 dB. The proposed design exhibits stable radiation patterns over the whole frequency band of interest, with a total realized gain more than 16 dBi. Due to the remarkable performance of the proposed array, it can be considered as a good candidate for 5G communication applications.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "909", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "913", "date_publication": "Thu Aug 28 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14578402", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Sep 08 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "909 - 913", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Osama M.
