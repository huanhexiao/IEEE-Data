This rapid growth combined with millions of applications (apps) make smart phones a favorite means of communication among users. In general, the available contents on smart phones, apps, and Web, come in two versions: (1) free content that is monetized via advertisements (ads) and (2) paid content that is monetized by user subscription fees. However, the resources, namely, energy, bandwidth, and processing power, on-board are limited, and the existence of ads in Web sites and free apps can significantly increase the usage of these resources. These issues necessitate a good understanding of the mobile advertising eco-system and how such limited resources can be efficiently used. In this paper, we present the results of a novel Web browsing technique that adapts the Web pages delivered to smart phone, based on the smart phone's current battery level and the network type. Web pages are adapted by controlling the amount of ads to be displayed. Validation tests confirm that the system can extend smart phone battery life by up to 30% and save wireless bandwidth up to ~44%.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1427", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1441", "date_publication": "Fri Oct 24 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14815901", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Dec 12 00:00:00 EST 2014", "pages": "1427 - 1441", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Abdurhman Ali Albasir", "Kshirasagar Naik"], "keywords": ["Web sites", "advertising", "online front-ends", "power aware computing", "smart phones", "SMoW", "Web pages", "Web sites", "advertisements", "bandwidth resource", "energy resource", "energy-bandwidth aware Web browsing technique", "free applications", "mobile advertising eco-system", "mobile devices", "monetized free content", "monetized paid content", "processing power resource", "smart phone applications", "smart phone battery life level", "smart phone network type", "user subscription fees", "validation tests", "wireless bandwidth", "Browsers", "Computer applications", "Energy efficiency", "Mobile communication", "Smart phones", "Web and internet services", "Smarphones", "efficient web browsing", "energy efficiency", "web adaptation", ""], "arnumber": "6936284"}
