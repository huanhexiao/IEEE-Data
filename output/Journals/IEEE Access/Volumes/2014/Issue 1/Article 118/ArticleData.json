Open data can provide new business opportunities for actors that provide data, for actors that consume data, and for actors that develop innovative services and applications around the data. Open data based business requires business models and a collaborative environment-called an ecosystem-to support businesses based on open data, services, and applications. This paper outlines the open data ecosystem (ODE) from the business viewpoint and then defines the requirements of such an ecosystem. The outline and requirements are based on the state-of-the-art knowledge explored from the literature and the state of the practice on data-based business in the industry collected through interviews. The interviews revealed several motives and advantages of the ODE. However, there are also obstacles that should be carefully considered and solved. This paper defines the actors of the ODE and their roles in the ecosystem as well as the business model elements and services that are needed in open data based business. According to the interviews, the interest in open data and open data ecosystems is high at this moment. However, further research work is required to establish and validate the ODE in the near future.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "88", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "103", "date_publication": "Fri Jan 31 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14110364", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Feb 19 00:00:00 EST 2014", "pages": "88 - 103", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Anne Immonen", "Marko Palviainen", "Eila Ovaska"], "keywords": ["business data processing", "groupware", "ODE", "business model", "collaborative environment", "open data based business ecosystem", "Biological system modeling", "Companies", "Data models", "Ecosystems", "Licenses", "Business ecosystem", "open data", ""], "arnumber": "6730652"}
