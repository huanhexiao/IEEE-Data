The nanoparticles can be functionalized as molecular probes for biological targets to facilitate numerous preclinical studies for translation toward diagnosis and therapy of various human diseases. Iodine has a K-edge at 33 keV due to the photoelectric absorption of photons, which emit X-ray fluorescence at 28 keV with a fluorescence yield of 0.88. Detections of the characteristic X-rays can be used for the imaging of iodine concentration distribution in an object. In this paper, we propose an X-ray fluorescence computed tomography method for reconstruction of a LINPs distribution over a region of interest (ROI) in a small animal. X-rays are focused onto a submillimeter focal spot utilizing a polycapillary lens, generating a pair of X-ray cones in the animal. This focused beam irradiates LINPs, the most strongly at the focal spot. Then, the focal spot can be scanned over an ROI in the object to produce X-ray fluorescence signals. From measured fluorescence data, a reliable image reconstruction can be achieved with a high spatial resolution. Numerical simulation studies are performed to demonstrate the superior imaging performance of this methodology.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1138", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1142", "date_publication": "Thu Oct 09 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14641280", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Oct 13 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "1138 - 1142", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Wenxiang Cong", "Yan Xi", "Ge Wang"], "keywords": ["X-ray fluorescence analysis", "biomedical optical imaging", "computerised tomography", "diagnostic radiography", "diseases", "fluorescence", "image reconstruction", "iodine", "nanomedicine", "nanoparticles", "numerical analysis", "patient diagnosis", "ROI", "X-ray cones", "X-ray fluorescence computed tomography method", "X-ray fluorescence signals", "fluorescence yield", "focal spot", "human diseases", "imaging performance", "intravascular contrast", "iodine concentration distribution imaging", "liposomal iodine nanoparticles", "molecular probes", "patient diagnosis", "patient therapy", "photoelectric absorption", "polycapillary focusing", "reconstruction", "region of interest", "submillimeter focal spot polycapillary lens", "Biomedical image processing", "Computed tomography", "Fluorescence", "Image reconstruction", "Nanoparticles", "Probes", "X-ray imaging", "Liposomal iodine nanoparticles", "compressed sensing", "image reconstruction", "polycapillary lens", "x-ray fluorescence CT", ""], "arnumber": "6919257"}
