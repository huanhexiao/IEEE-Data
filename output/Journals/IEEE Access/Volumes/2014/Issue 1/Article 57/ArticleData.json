To achieve this flexibility, it may be worth examining an unconventional algorithm such as topological methods. Here, we propose a fully parallelized algorithm for a shape-invariant touch counter for 2-D pixels. The number of touches is counted by the Euler integral, a generalized integral, in which a connected component counter (Betti number) for the binary image was used as elemental module. Through examples of touches, we demonstrate transparently how the proposed circuit architecture embodies the Euler integral in the form of recurrent neural networks for iterative vector operations. Our parallelization can lead the way to Field-Programmable Gate Array or Digital Signal Processor implementations of topological algorithms with scalability to high resolutions of pixels.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "960", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "970", "date_publication": "Tue Aug 26 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14578397", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Sep 10 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "960 - 970", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Keiji Miura", "Kazuki Nakada"], "keywords": ["brain", "calculus", "field programmable gate arrays", "integral equations", "medical image processing", "neurophysiology", "parallel algorithms", "touch sensitive screens", "2-D pixel", "Betti number", "Euler calculus", "Euler integral", "activated tactile sensory neuron population", "binary image", "brain ability", "circuit architecture", "connected component counter", "digital signal processor implementation", "elemental module", "field-programmable gate array", "fully parallelized algorithm", "generalized integral", "global information consistency", "high pixel resolution", "individual object number counting", "iterative vector operation", "neuromorphic engineering", "object shape", "recurrent neural network form", "shape-invariant touch counter neural implementation", "topological algorithm", "topological method", "touche number", "unconventional algorithm", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Brain modeling", "Calculus", "Neuromorphic engineering", "Object detection", "Radiation detectors", "Shape analysis", "Sociology", "Visualization", "Euler calculus", "invariance", "neuromorphic engineering", "sensor networks", "topology", "touch counter", ""], "arnumber": "6883116"}
