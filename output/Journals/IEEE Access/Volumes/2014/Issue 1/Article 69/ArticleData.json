For recognizing faces with age variations, researchers have generally focused on the skeletal structure and muscle mass. However, the effect of change in body fat has not been studied with respect to face recognition. In this paper, we incorporate weight information to improve the performance of face recognition with age variations. The proposed algorithm utilizes neural network and random decision forest to encode age variations across different weight categories. The results are reported on the WhoIsIt database prepared by the authors containing 1109 images from 110 individuals with age and weight variations. The comparison with existing state-of-the-art algorithms and commercial system on WhoIsIt and FG-Net databases shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing algorithms significantly.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "822", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "830", "date_publication": "Tue Aug 05 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14541710", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 28 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "822 - 830", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Maneet Singh", "Shruti Nagpal", "Richa Singh", "Mayank Vatsa"], "keywords": ["age issues", "biometrics (access control)", "decision trees", "face recognition", "learning (artificial intelligence)", "neural nets", "FG-Net database", "WhoIsIt database", "age variation", "biometrics", "body fat", "face image recognition", "muscle mass", "neural network", "random decision forest", "skeletal structure", "weight information", "weight variation", "Aging", "Biomedical imaging", "Face recognition", "Muscles", "Skeleton", "Face recognition", "biometrics", "facial aging", ""], "arnumber": "6871282"}
