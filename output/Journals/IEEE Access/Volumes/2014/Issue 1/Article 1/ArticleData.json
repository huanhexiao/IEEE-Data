Over the last few years, we have seen a plethora of IoT solutions making their way into the industry marketplace. Context-aware communications and computing have played a critical role throughout the last few years of ubiquitous computing and are expected to play a significant role in the IoT paradigm as well. In this paper, we examine a variety of popular and innovative IoT solutions in terms of context-aware technology perspectives. More importantly, we evaluate these IoT solutions using a framework that we built around well-known context-aware computing theories. This survey is intended to serve as a guideline and a conceptual framework for context-aware product development and research in the IoT paradigm. It also provides a systematic exploration of existing IoT products in the marketplace and highlights a number of potentially significant research directions and trends.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1660", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1679", "date_publication": "Thu Jan 08 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14877903", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Jan 26 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "1660 - 1679", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Charith Perera", "Chi Harold Liu", "Srimal Jayawardena", "Min Chen"], "keywords": ["Internet of Things", "industrial economics", "product development", "production engineering computing", "Internet of Things", "IoT", "context-aware product development", "industrial market", "ubiquitous computing", "Context awareness", "Futures research", "Globalization", "Information networks", "Interconnections", "Internet", "Internet of things", "Market research", "Product development", "Internet of Things", "Internet of things", "IoT marketplace", "context-awareness", "contextawareness", "industry solutions", "product review", ""], "arnumber": "7004894"}
