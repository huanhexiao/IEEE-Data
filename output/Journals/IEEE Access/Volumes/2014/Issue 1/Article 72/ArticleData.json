Inspired by the CS theory, the interior problem in computed tomography is proved uniquely solvable by minimizing the region-of-interest's total variation if the imaging object is piecewise constant or polynomial. This is called CS-based interior tomography. However, the CS-based algorithms require high computational cost due to their iterative nature. In this paper, a graphics processing unit (GPU)-based parallel computing technique is applied to accelerate the CS-based interior reconstruction for practical application in both fan-beam and cone-beam geometries. Our results show that the CS-based interior tomography is able to reconstruct excellent volumetric images with GPU acceleration in a few minutes.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "757", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "770", "date_publication": "Thu Jul 17 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14512368", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Aug 15 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "757 - 770", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Rui Liu", "Yan Luo", "Hengyong Yu"], "keywords": ["compressed sensing", "computational geometry", "computerised tomography", "graphics processing units", "image reconstruction", "iterative methods", "medical image processing", "parallel processing", "piecewise constant techniques", "piecewise polynomial techniques", "CS-based interior reconstruction", "CS-based interior tomography", "GPU-based acceleration", "compressive sensing theory", "computed tomography", "cone-beam geometries", "fan-beam geometries", "graphics processing unit-based parallel computing technique", "piecewise constant", "piecewise polynomial", "region-of-interest total variation minimization", "volumetric image reconstruction", "Compressive sensing", "Computed tomography", "Graphics", "Graphics processing unit", "IEEE standards", "Parallel processing", "Three dimensional displays", "Tomography", "X-ray tomography", "Computed tomography", "compressed sensing", "graphics processing unit", "interior tomography", "parallel computing", ""], "arnumber": "6857986"}
