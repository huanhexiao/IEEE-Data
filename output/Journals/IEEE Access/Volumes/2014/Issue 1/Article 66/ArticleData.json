As a result, significant challenges are imposed to identify the cause of link congestion between any pair of switch ports that may severely damage the overall network performance. Generally, it is expected that the granularity of the flow monitoring to diagnose network congestion in 5G DCNs needs to be down to the flow level on a physical port of a switch in real time with high-estimation accuracy, low-computational complexity, and good scalability. In this paper, motivated by a comprehensive study of a real DCN trace, we propose two sketch-based algorithms, called \u03b1-conservative update (CU) and P(d)-CU, based on the existing CU approach. \u03b1-CU adds no extra implementation cost to the traditional CU, but successfully trades off the achieved error with time complexity. P(d)-CU fully considers the amount of skew for different types of network services to aggregate traffic statistics of each type of network traffic at an individual, horizontally partitioned sketch. We also introduce a way to produce the real-time moving average of the reported results. By theoretical analysis and sufficient experimental results on a real DCN trace, we extensively evaluate the proposed and existing algorithms on their error performance, recall, space cost, and time complexity.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "841", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "855", "date_publication": "Mon Aug 18 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14541711", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Fri Aug 29 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "841 - 855", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Chi Harold Liu", "Jun Fan"], "keywords": ["Internet", "computational complexity", "computer centres", "computer network reliability", "mobile communication", "telecommunication congestion control", "telecommunication traffic", "&#x03B1", "-conservative update", "5G DCNs", "5G data center network traffic", "P(d)-CU", "bandwidth-hungry applications", "data analysis", "flow monitoring", "high-estimation accuracy", "link congestion", "low-computational complexity", "network congestion diagnosis", "network performance", "network services", "real-time search", "sketch-based algorithms", "switch ports", "time complexity", "traffic statistics", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Data centers", "IP networks", "Next generation networking", "Ports (Computers)", "Radiation detectors", "Scability", "Telecommunication traffic", "Data center networks", "congestion control", "flow monitoring and analysis", "sketching techniques", ""], "arnumber": "6879489"}
