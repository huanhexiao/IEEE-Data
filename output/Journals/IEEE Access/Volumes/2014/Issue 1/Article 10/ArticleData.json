This path of technological evolution has naturally led to a critical issue that has only started to be addressed recently: the resistance of this rapidly emerging technology to external attacks and, in particular, to spoofing. Spoofing, referred to by the term presentation attack in current standards, is a purely biometric vulnerability that is not shared with other IT security solutions. It refers to the ability to fool a biometric system into recognizing an illegitimate user as a genuine one by means of presenting a synthetic forged version of the original biometric trait to the sensor. The entire biometric community, including researchers, developers, standardizing bodies, and vendors, has thrown itself into the challenging task of proposing and developing efficient protection methods against this threat. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview on the work that has been carried out over the last decade in the emerging field of antispoofing, with special attention to the mature and largely deployed face modality. The work covers theories, methodologies, state-of-the-art techniques, and evaluation databases and also aims at providing an outlook into the future of this very active field of research.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1530", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1552", "date_publication": "Thu Dec 18 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14860607", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Wed Jan 07 00:00:00 EST 2015", "pages": "1530 - 1552", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Javier Galbally", "S\u00e9bastien Marcel", "Julian Fierrez"], "keywords": ["biometrics (access control)", "face recognition", "security of data", "biometric antispoofing methods", "biometric community", "biometric technology", "biometric vulnerability", "face recognition", "presentation attack", "synthetic forged version", "technological evolution", "voice recognition", "Access control", "Authentication", "Biomedical monitoring", "Biometrics", "Computer security", "Distance measurement", "Fingerprint recognition", "Immune system", "Iris recognition", "Speech recognition", "Anti-Spoofing", "Biometrics", "Security", "anti-spoofing", "face", "security", ""], "arnumber": "6990726"}
