A C-RAN system centralizes the baseband processing resources into a pool and virtualizes soft base-band units on demand. The major challenges for C-RAN including front-haul and virtualization are analyzed with potential solutions proposed. Extensive field trials verify the viability of various front-haul solutions, including common public radio interface compression, single fiber bidirection and wavelength-division multiplexing. In addition, C-RANs facilitation of coordinated multipoint (CoMP) implementation is demonstrated with 50%-100% uplink CoMP gain observed in field trials. Finally, a test bed is established based on general purpose platform with assisted accelerators. It is demonstrated that this test bed can support multi-RAT, i.e., Time-Division Duplexing Long Term Evolution, Frequency-Division Duplexing Long Term Evolution, and Global System for Mobile Communications efficiently and presents similar performance to traditional systems.", "journal_title": "IEEE Access", "firstpage": "1030", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "1039", "date_publication": "Fri Aug 22 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE", "inspec": "14620829", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Sep 22 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "pages": "1030 - 1039", "issn": "2169-3536"}, "authors": ["Chih-Lin I", "Jinri Huang", "Ran Duan", "Chunfeng Cui", "Jesse (Xiaogen) Jiang", "Lei Li"], "keywords": ["Long Term Evolution", "cellular radio", "cloud computing", "frequency division multiplexing", "radio access networks", "telecommunication computing", "time division multiplexing", "virtualisation", "wavelength division multiplexing", "C-RAN centralization", "C-RAN facilitation", "C-RAN system", "CoMP implementation", "baseband processing resources", "cloudification", "common public radio interface compression", "coordinated multipoint implementation", "field trials", "frequency-division duplexing Long Term Evolution", "front-haul", "front-haul solutions", "general purpose platform", "global system for mobile communications", "multiRAT", "single-fiber bidirection", "soft base-band units", "time-division duplexing Long Term Evolution", "uplink CoMP gain", "virtualization", "wavelength-division multiplexing", "Mobile communication", "Optical fiber devices", "Optical fiber networks", "Optical fiber testing", "Radio access networks", "Virtualization", "Wavelength division multiplexing", "C-RAN", "CoMP", "cloud", "front-haul", "virtualization", ""], "arnumber": "6882182"}
