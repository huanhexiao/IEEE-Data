The benefit of TABWS in functional recovery of walking in spinal cord injury and stroke patients has been demonstrated and reported. However, shortage of therapists, labor-intensiveness, and short duration of training are some limitations of this approach. To overcome these deficiencies, robotic-assisted gait rehabilitation systems have been suggested. These systems have gained attentions from researchers and clinical practitioner in recent years. To achieve the same objective, an over-ground gait rehabilitation system, NaTUre-gaits, was developed at the Nanyang Technological University. The design was based on a clinical approach to provide four main features, which are pelvic motion, body weight support, over-ground walking experience, and lower limb assistance. These features can be achieved by three main modules of NaTUre-gaits: 1) pelvic assistance mechanism, mobile platform, and robotic orthosis. Predefined gait patterns are required for a robotic assisted system to follow. In this paper, the gait pattern planning for NaTUre-gaits was accomplished by an individual-specific gait pattern prediction model. The model generates gait patterns that resemble natural gait patterns of the targeted subjects. The features of NaTUre-gaits have been demonstrated by walking trials with several subjects. The trials have been evaluated by therapists and doctors. The results show that 10-m walking trial with a reduction in manpower. The task-specific repetitive training approach and natural walking gait patterns were also successfully achieved.", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "9", "date_publication": "2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "inspec": "14110553", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Thu Feb 13 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issn": "2168-2372"}, "authors": ["Trieu Phat Luu", "Kin Huat Low", "Xingda Qu", "Hup Boon Lim", "Kay Hiang Hoon"], "keywords": ["gait analysis", "injuries", "medical robotics", "mobile robots", "orthotics", "patient rehabilitation", "NaTUre-gaits", "TABWS gait rehabilitation", "clinical approach", "gait pattern planning", "hardware development", "individual-specific gait pattern prediction model", "labor-intensiveness", "locomotion control strategy", "lower limb assistance", "mobile platform", "natural walking gait patterns", "over-ground gait trainer", "over-ground walking", "pelvic assistance mechanism", "pelvic motion", "robotic orthosis", "robotic-assisted gait rehabilitation systems", "spinal cord injury", "stroke patients", "task-specific repetitive training approach", "therapist-assisted body weight supported gait rehabilitation", "Gait analysis", "Legged locomotion", "Mobile communication", "Patient rehabilitation", "Predictive models", "Robotic gait rehabilitation", "gait pattern planning", "over-ground gait trainer", ""], "arnumber": "6729037"}
