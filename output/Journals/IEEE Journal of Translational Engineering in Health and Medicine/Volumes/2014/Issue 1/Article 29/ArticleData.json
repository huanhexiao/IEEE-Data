A trained person may not be available at emergency sites to give CPR. Normally, a 9-1-1 operator gives verbal instructions over the phone to a person giving CPR. In this paper, we discuss the use of smartphones to assist in administering CPR more efficiently and accurately. The two important CPR parameters are the frequency and depth of compressions. In this paper, we used smartphones to calculate these factors and to give real-time guidance to improve CPR. In addition, we used an application to measure oxygen saturation in blood. If blood oxygen saturation falls below an acceptable threshold, the person giving CPR can be asked to do mouth-to-mouth breathing. The 9-1-1 operator receives this information real time and can further guide the person giving CPR. Our experiments show accuracy >90% for compression frequency, depth, and oxygen saturation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "11", "date_publication": "2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "inspec": "14396442", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issn": "2168-2372"}, "authors": ["Neeraj K.
