The EEG products, especially sensors, highly prioritize the comfort level during devices wear. To overcome these drawbacks for EEG sensors, this paper designs Societe Generale de Surveillance S \u00b7 A \u00b7 (SGS)-certified, silicon-based dry-contact EEG sensors (SBDSs) for EEG signal measurements. According to the SGS testing report, SBDSs extract does not irritate skin or induce noncytotoxic effects on L929 cells according to ISO10993-5. The SBDS is also lightweight, flexible, and nonirritating to the skin, as well as capable of easily fitting to scalps without any skin preparation or use of a conductive gel. For forehead and hairy sites, EEG signals can be measured reliably with the designed SBDSs. In particular, for EEG signal measurements at hairy sites, the acicular and flexible design of SBDS can push the hair aside to achieve satisfactory scalp contact, as well as maintain low skin-electrode interface impedance. Results of this paper demonstrate that the proposed sensors perform well in the EEG measurements and are feasible for practical applications.", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "7", "date_publication": "Thu Nov 06 00:00:00 EST 2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "inspec": "14784502", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 02 00:00:00 EST 2014", "issn": "2168-2372"}, "authors": ["Yi-Hsin Yu", "Shao-Wei Lu", "Lun-De Liao", "Chin-Teng Lin"], "keywords": ["cellular biophysics", "electric sensing devices", "electroencephalography", "elemental semiconductors", "silicon", "skin", "toxicology", "EEG", "ISO10993-5", "L929 cells", "SGS testing", "Societe Generale de Surveillance", "electroencephalography signal measurements", "flexible silicon-based dry sensors", "forehead", "hairy sites", "low skin-electrode interface impedance", "noncytotoxic effects", "skin irritation", "user discomfort", "Electrodes", "Electroencephalography", "Impedance", "Impedance measurement", "Materials", "Sensors", "Skin", "Non-skin irritation", "Societe Generale de Surveillance S $cdot$ A $cdot$ (SGS)", "Societe Generale de Surveillance S???A???
