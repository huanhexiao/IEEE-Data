However, the obstruction mechanism in the lower urinary tract and critical points for obstruction remains uncertain. The aim of this paper was to develop a system to investigate the relationship between voiding dysfunction and alteration of the shape of the prostatic urethra by processing endoscopic video images of the urethra and analyzing the fluid dynamics of the urine stream. A panoramic image of the prostatic urethra was generated from cystourethroscopic video images. A virtual 3-D model of the urethra was constructed using the luminance values in the image. Fluid dynamics using the constructed model was then calculated assuming a static urethra and maximum urine flow rate. Cystourethroscopic videos from 11 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia were recorded around administration of an alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist. The calculated pressure loss through the prostatic urethra in each model corresponded to the prostatic volume, and the improvements of the pressure loss after treatment correlated to the conventional clinical indices. As shown by the proposed method, the shape of the prostatic urethra affects the transporting urine fluid energy, and this paper implies a possible method for detecting critical lesions responsible for voiding dysfunction. The proposed method provides critical information about deformation of the prostatic urethra on voiding function. Detailed differences in the various types of relaxants for the lower urinary tract could be estimated.", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "9", "date_publication": "2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "inspec": "14263554", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issn": "2168-2372"}, "authors": ["Takuro Ishii", "Yoichi Kambara", "Tomonori Yamanishi", "Yukio Naya", "Tatsuo Igarashi"], "keywords": ["biological fluid dynamics", "biological organs", "endoscopes", "medical image processing", "video signal processing", "aged male population", "alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist", "benign prostatic hyperplasia", "critical lesion detection", "cystourethroscopic video images", "endoscopic imagery", "endoscopic video image processing", "lower urinary tract", "luminance values", "maximum urine flow rate", "obstruction mechanism", "panoramic image", "pressure loss", "prostatic urethra deformation", "prostatic urethra shape alteration", "prostatic volume", "tubular organ modeling", "urine flow dynamics", "urine fluid energy", "urine stream", "virtual 3D model", "voiding dysfunction", "Bladder", "Computational fluid dynamics", "Endoscopes", "Solid modeling", "Streaming media", "Three-dimensional displays", "Tubular organs", "Benign prostatic hyperplasia", "computational biophysics", "computer-aided diagnosis", "cystourethroscopy", "endoscopes", "fluid dynamics", "less invasive therapy", "voiding dysfunction", ""], "arnumber": "6784320"}
