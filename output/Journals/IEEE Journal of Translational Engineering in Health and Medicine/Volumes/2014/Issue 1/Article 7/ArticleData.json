Gastrointestinal diseases are mainly based on morphological abnormalities. However, gastrointestinal symptoms are sometimes apparent without visible abnormalities. One of the major factors for these diseases is abnormal gastrointestinal motility. For assessment of gastric motility, a gastric motility imaging system is needed. To assess the dynamic motility of the stomach, the proposed system measures 3-D gastric contractions derived from a 3-D profile of the stomach wall obtained with a developed 3-D endoscope. After obtaining contraction waves, their frequency, amplitude, and speed of propagation can be calculated using a Gaussian function. The proposed system was evaluated for 3-D measurements of several objects with known geometries. The results showed that the surface profiles could be obtained with an error of <;10% of the distance between two different points on images. Subsequently, we evaluated the validity of a prototype system using a wave simulated model. In the experiment, the amplitude and position of waves could be measured with 1-mm accuracy. The present results suggest that the proposed system can measure the speed and amplitude of contractions. This system has low invasiveness and can assess the motility of the stomach wall directly in a 3-D manner. Our method can be used for examination of gastric morphological and functional abnormalities.", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "inspec": "14057307", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issn": "2168-2372"}, "authors": ["Kayo Yoshimoto", "Kenji Yamada", "Kenji Watabe", "Maki Takeda", "Takahiro Nishimura", "Michiko Kido", "Toshiaki Nagakura", "Hideya Takahashi", "Tsutomu Nishida", "Hideki Iijima", "Masahiko Tsujii", "Tetsuo Takehara", "Yuko Ohno"], "keywords": ["Gaussian processes", "biological organs", "biomechanics", "biomedical optical imaging", "diseases", "endoscopes", "image motion analysis", "medical image processing", "physiological models", "prototypes", "wave propagation", "3D endoscope", "3D gastric contraction measurement", "3D measurements", "3D stomach wall profile", "Gaussian function", "abnormal gastrointestinal motility", "contraction amplitude measurement", "contraction speed measurement", "contraction wave amplitude calculation", "contraction wave frequency calculation", "contraction wave propagation speed calculation", "dynamic stomach motility assessment", "gastric contraction imaging system", "gastric functional abnormalities", "gastric morphological abnormalities", "gastric motility assessment", "gastric motility imaging system", "gastrointestinal diseases", "gastrointestinal symptoms", "prototype system", "stomach wall motility", "surface profiles", "wave amplitude measurement", "wave position measurement", "wave simulated model", "Endoscopes", "Gastrointestinal tract", "Stomach", "Surface reconstruction", "Surface waves", "Three dimensional displays", "Endoscopes", "gastric contraction", "gastric motility", "gastroenterology", ""], "arnumber": "6705622"}
