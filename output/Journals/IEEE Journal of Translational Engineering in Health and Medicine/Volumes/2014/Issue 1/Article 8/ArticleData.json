However, conventional mutual information does not consider spatial dependency between adjacent voxels in images, thus reducing its efficacy as a similarity measure in image registration. This paper first presents a review of the existing attempts to incorporate spatial dependency into the computation of mutual information (MI). Then, a recently introduced spatially dependent similarity measure, named spatial MI, is extended to 3-D brain image registration. This extension also eliminates its artifact for translational misregistration. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed 3-D spatial MI as a similarity measure is compared with three existing MI measures by applying controlled levels of noise degradation to 3-D simulated brain images.", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "firstpage": "27", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "34", "date_publication": "2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "inspec": "14067004", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issn": "2168-2372"}, "authors": ["Qolamreza R.
