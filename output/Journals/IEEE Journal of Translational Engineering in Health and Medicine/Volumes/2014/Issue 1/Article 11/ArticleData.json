Fixed thresholding models are frequently utilized clinically to segment and quantify scar in DE-MRI due to their simplicity. These methods fail to provide a standardized quantification due to interobserver variability. Quantification of scar can be used as an endpoint in clinical studies and therefore standardization is important. In this paper, we propose a segmentation algorithm for LA fibrosis quantification and investigate its performance. The algorithm was validated using numerical phantoms and 15 clinical data sets from patients undergoing LA ablation. We demonstrate that the approach produces good concordance with expert manual delineations. The method offers a standardized quantification technique for evaluation and interpretation of DE-MRI scans.", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "15", "date_publication": "2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "inspec": "14235832", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Apr 07 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issn": "2168-2372"}, "authors": ["Rashed Karim", "Aruna Arujuna", "Richard James Housden", "Jaspal Gill", "Hannah Cliffe", "Kavir Matharu", "Jaswinder Gill", "Christopher Aldo Rindaldi", "Mark O'Neill", "Daniel Rueckert", "Reza Razavi", "Tobias Schaeffter", "Kawal Rhode"], "keywords": ["biomedical MRI", "blood vessels", "cardiovascular system", "image segmentation", "medical disorders", "medical image processing", "phantoms", "radiation therapy", "radiofrequency heating", "standardisation", "DE-MRI scans", "LA ablation", "LA fibrosis quantification", "atrial fibrillation treatment", "clinical data sets", "delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging", "expert manual delineations", "fixed thresholding model", "interobserver variability", "left atrial fibrosis detection", "left atrial scar", "numerical phantom", "postradiofrequency ablation", "preradiofrequency ablation", "scar quantification", "scar segmentation", "segmentation algorithm", "standardization", "standardized quantification technique", "Adaptation models", "Biolgical tissues", "Biomedical imaging", "Blood", "Image segmentation", "Magnetic resonance imaging", "Myocardium", "Delayed-enhancement MRI", "fibrosis", "image segmentation", "left atrium", ""], "arnumber": "6774956"}
