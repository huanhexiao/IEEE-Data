This form of rehabilitation consists of physical exercises adapted to the specific pathology. Its effectiveness is strongly dependent on the patient's adhesion to such a program. In this paper, we present a novel device with remote monitoring capabilities expressly conceived for the needs of rheumatic patients. It comprises several sensorized tools and can be used either in an outpatient clinic for hand functional evaluation, connected to a PC, or afforded to the patient for home kinesiotherapic sessions. In the latter case, the device guides the patient in the rehabilitation session, transmitting the relevant statistics about his performance to a TCP/IP server exploiting a GSM/GPRS connection for deferred analysis. An approved clinical trial has been set up in Italy, involving 10 patients with rheumatoid arthritis and 10 with systemic sclerosis, enrolled for 12 weeks in a home rehabilitation program with the proposed device. Their evaluation has been performed not only with traditional methods, but also with the proposed device. Subjective (hand algofunctional Dreiser's index) and objective (ROM, strength, and dexterity) parameters showed a sustained improvement throughout the follow-up. The obtained results proved that the device is an effective and safe tool for assessing hand disability and monitoring kinesiotherapy exercise, portending the potential exploitability of such a methodology in the clinical practice.", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "11", "date_publication": "2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "inspec": "14067005", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issn": "2168-2372"}, "authors": ["Danilo Pani", "Gianluca Barabino", "Alessia Dess\u00ec", "Iosto Tradori", "Matteo Piga", "Alessandro Mathieu", "Luigi Raffo"], "keywords": ["adhesion", "biomedical equipment", "cellular radio", "diseases", "injuries", "medical diagnostic computing", "packet radio networks", "patient monitoring", "patient rehabilitation", "patient treatment", "statistical analysis", "transport protocols", "GSM-GPRS connection", "ROM", "TCP-IP server", "chronic diseases", "current clinical practice", "hand algofunctional Dreiser index", "hand disability", "hand functional evaluation", "hand functionality lost", "hand rehabilitation sessions", "home kinesiotherapic sessions", "injuries", "interventions", "kinesiotherapic intervention", "kinesiotherapy exercise monitoring", "local monitoring device", "outpatient clinic", "pathology", "patient adhesion", "patient kinesiotherapic sessions", "pharmacological treatments", "physical exercises", "remote monitoring capabilities", "remote monitoring device", "rheumatic patients", "rheumatoid arthritis", "sensorized tools", "statistics", "systemic sclerosis", "time 12 week", "Biomedical monitoring", "Clinical diagnosis", "Diseases", "Injuries", "Performance evaluation", "Remote monitoring", "Telerehabilitation", "adapted physical exercise", "rehabilitation", "rheumatic diseases", "telemedicine", ""], "arnumber": "6708427"}
