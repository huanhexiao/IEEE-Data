In addition to allowing some of the active sites to reach less compromised tissue, the barb-like protrusions that also serves the purpose of anchoring the electrode array into the tissue. This paper is an early evaluation of technical aspects and performance of this electrode array in acute in vitro/in vivo experiments. The interface impedance was reduced by up to two decades by electroplating the active sites with platinum black. The platinum black also allowed for a reduced phase lag for higher frequency components. The distance between the protrusions of the electrode array was tailored to match the architecture of the rat cerebral cortex. In vivo acute measurements confirmed a high signal-to-noise ratio for the neural recordings, and no significant crosstalk between recording channels.", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "2", "lastpage": "7", "date_publication": "2014", "sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "inspec": "14415132", "date": "2014", "date_current_version": "Mon Jun 30 00:00:00 EDT 2014", "issn": "2168-2372"}, "authors": ["Fredrik Ejserholm", "Per K\u00f6hler", "Marcus Granmo", "Jens Schouenborg", "Martin Bengtsson", "Lars Wallman"], "keywords": ["bioMEMS", "bioelectric potentials", "biological tissues", "biomedical electrodes", "biomedical measurement", "brain", "brain-computer interfaces", "electric impedance", "electroplating", "foils", "medical signal processing", "microelectrodes", "neurophysiology", "platinum", "polymers", "&#x03BC", "-foil polymer electrode array", "Pt", "acute in vitro-in vivo experiments", "barb-like protrusions", "compromised tissue", "electrode array anchoring", "electroplating", "flexible electrodes", "higher-frequency components", "in vivo acute measurements", "interface impedance", "intracortical neural recordings", "multichannel electrode array", "phase lag", "platinum black", "rat cerebral cortex", "recording channels", "signal-to-noise ratio", "thin foil", "Biological tissues", "Brain modeling", "Crosstalk", "Electrodes", "Impedance", "In vitro", "Multiaccess communication", "Biomedical electrodes", "brain-computer interfaces", "implantable biomedical devices", "microelectrodes", "neural engineering", "polymers", ""], "arnumber": "6823093"}
