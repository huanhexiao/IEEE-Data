Aspiration due to dysphagia is a major health risk that could cause pneumonia and even death. The videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS), which is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of dysphagia, is not widely available, expensive and causes exposure to radiation. The screening tests used for dysphagia need to be carried out by trained staff, and the evaluations are usually non-quantifiable. This paper investigates the development of the Swallowscope, a smartphone-based device and a feasible real-time swallowing sound-processing algorithm for the automatic screening, quantitative evaluation, and the visualisation of swallowing ability. The device can be used during activities of daily life with minimal intervention, making it potentially more capable of capturing aspirations and risky swallow patterns through the continuous monitoring. It also consists of a cloud-based system for the server-side analyzing and automatic sharing of the swallowing sound. The real-time algorithm we developed for the detection of dry and water swallows is based on a template matching approach. We analyzed the wavelet transformation-based spectral characteristics and the temporal characteristics of simultaneous synchronised VFSS and swallowing sound recordings of 25% barium mixed 3-ml water swallows of 70 subjects and the dry or saliva swallowing sound of 15 healthy subjects to establish the parameters of the template. With this algorithm, we achieved an overall detection accuracy of 79.3% (standard error: 4.2%) for the 92 water swallows; and a precision of 83.7% (range: 66.6%-100%) and a recall of 93.9% (range: 72.7%-100%) for the 71 episodes of dry swallows.", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "Fri Nov 13 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "inspec": "15623153", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Dec 01 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issn": "2168-2372"}, "authors": ["Dushyantha Jayatilake", "Tomoyuki Ueno", "Yohei Teramoto", "Kei Nakai", "Kikue Hidaka", "Satoshi Ayuzawa", "Kiyoshi Eguchi", "Akira Matsumura", "Kenji Suzuki"], "keywords": ["biomedical equipment", "biomedical optical imaging", "medical disorders", "medical image processing", "smart phones", "automatic sharing", "cloud-based system", "continuous monitoring", "dry swallowing", "dry swallows", "dysphagia diagnosis", "gold standard", "health risk", "mental health", "overall detection accuracy", "pneumonia", "real-time algorithm", "risky swallow patterns", "saliva swallowing sound", "screening testing", "server-side analyzing", "simultaneous synchronised VFSS", "smartphone-based device", "smartphone-based real-time assessment", "swallowing ability", "swallowing sound recordings", "transformation-based spectral characteristics", "videofluoroscopic swallow study", "water swallows", "Algorithm design and analysis", "Diseases", "Hospitals", "Liquids", "Medical diagnostic imaging", "Monitoring", "Bedside monitoring", "Cervical auscultation", "Dysphagia", "Realtime monitoring", "Screening", "Swallowing sound", "Videofluoroscopy", "bedside monitoring", "cervical auscultation", "mHealth", "realtime monitoring", "screening", "videofluoroscopy", ""], "arnumber": "7328724"}
