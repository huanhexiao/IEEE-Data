State of art equipment for stiffness evaluation are expensive, require expertise to operate and not amenable for field deployment. In this context, we developed ARTerial Stiffness Evaluation for Noninvasive Screening (ARTSENS), a device for image free, noninvasive, automated evaluation of vascular stiffness amenable for field use. ARTSENS has a frugal hardware design, utilizing a single ultrasound transducer to interrogate the carotid artery, integrated with robust algorithms that extract arterial dimensions and compute clinically accepted measures of arterial stiffness. The ability of ARTSENS to measure vascular stiffness in vivo was validated by performing measurements on 125 subjects. The accuracy of results was verified with the state-of-the-art ultrasound imaging-based echo-tracking system. The relation between arterial stiffness measurements performed in sitting posture for ARTSENS measurement and sitting/supine postures for imaging system was also investigated to examine feasibility of performing ARTSENS measurements in the sitting posture for field deployment. This paper verified the feasibility of the novel ARTSENS device in performing accurate in vivo measurements of arterial stiffness. As a portable device that performs automated measurement of carotid artery stiffness with minimal operator input, ARTSENS has strong potential for use in large-scale screening.", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "13", "date_publication": "Tue May 12 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "inspec": "15147698", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Fri May 22 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issn": "2168-2372"}, "authors": ["Jayaraj Joseph", "Ravikumar Radhakrishnan", "Shitanshu Kusmakar", "Arya Sree Thrivikraman", "Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam"], "keywords": ["biomechanics", "biomedical transducers", "biomedical ultrasonics", "blood vessels", "cardiovascular system", "diseases", "large-scale systems", "medical image processing", "ultrasonic imaging", "ultrasonic transducers", "ARTSENS measurement", "ARTSENS measurements", "arterial stiffness measurements", "automated measurement", "cardiovascular diagnosis", "cardiovascular health", "cardiovascular screening", "carotid artery stiffness", "coronary heart disease", "frugal hardware design", "image free device", "in vivo measurements", "large-scale screening", "minimal operator input", "noninvasive screening", "robust algorithms", "sitting-supine postures", "state of art equipment", "state-of-the-art ultrasound imaging-based echo-tracking system", "ultrasound transducer", "vascular stiffness in vivo", "Carotid arteries", "Pressure measurement", "Probes", "Transducers", "Ultrasonic imaging", "Ultrasonic variables measurement", "ARTSENS", "Arterial stiffness", "cardiovascular disease", "carotid artery", "vascular stiffness", ""], "arnumber": "7105853"}
