In order to meet functional and safety specifications, it was necessary to develop a custom device. A system is presented which can deliver charge-balanced, constant-current biphasic pulses, with widely adjustable parameters, to arbitrary configurations of output electrodes. This system is shown to be effective in eliciting visual percepts in a patient with approximately 20 years of light perception vision only due to retinitis pigmentosa, using an electrode array implanted in the suprachoroidal space of the eye. The flexibility of the system also makes it suitable for use in a number of other emerging clinical neurostimulation applications, including epileptic seizure suppression and closed-loop deep brain stimulation.
