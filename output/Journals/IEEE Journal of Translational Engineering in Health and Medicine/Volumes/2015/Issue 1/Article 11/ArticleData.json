It uses a variety of models to enable improvement against experiential and operational health service goals. Patient satisfaction levels are estimated using a model based on waiting (waiting times). Staff satisfaction levels are estimated using a model based on the time spent with patients (service time). An integrated model of patient and staff satisfaction, the effective satisfaction level model, is then proposed (using queuing theory). This links patient satisfaction, waiting time, staff satisfaction, and service time, connecting two important concepts, namely, experience and efficiency in care delivery and leading to a more holistic approach in designing and managing health services. The proposed model will enable healthcare systems analysts to objectively and directly relate elements of service quality to capacity planning. Moreover, as an instrument used jointly by healthcare commissioners and providers, it affords the prospect of better resource allocation.", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "Fri Feb 06 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "inspec": "14929051", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Feb 20 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issn": "2168-2372"}, "authors": ["Alexander Komashie", "Ali Mousavi", "P.
