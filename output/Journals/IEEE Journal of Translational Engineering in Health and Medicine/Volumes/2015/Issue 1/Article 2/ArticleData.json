However, accurate clinical assessment of visual function in young children is challenging. optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) is a reflexive sawtooth motion of the eye that occurs in response to drifting stimuli, that may allow for objective measurement of visual function in young children if appropriate child-friendly eye tracking techniques are available. In this paper, we present offline tools to detect the presence and direction of the optokinetic reflex in children using consumer grade video equipment. Our methods are tested on video footage of children (N = 5 children and 20 trials) taken as they freely observed visual stimuli that induced horizontal OKN. Using results from an experienced observer as a baseline, we found the sensitivity and specificity of our OKN detection method to be 89.13% and 98.54%, respectively, across all trials. Our OKN detection results also compared well (85%) with results obtained from a clinically trained assessor. In conclusion, our results suggest that OKN presence and direction can be measured objectively in children using consumer grade equipment, and readily implementable algorithms.", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "Thu Mar 05 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "inspec": "15012161", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Mar 24 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issn": "2168-2372"}, "authors": ["Mehrdad Sangi", "Benjamin Thompson", "Jason Turuwhenua"], "keywords": ["eye", "patient diagnosis", "video equipment", "vision defects", "OKN detection method sensitivity", "OKN detection method specificity", "amblyopia", "child-friendly eye tracking technique", "children video footage", "consumer grade equipment", "consumer grade video equipment", "eye reflexive sawtooth motion", "neurodevelopmental disorders", "optokinetic nystagmus detection method", "optokinetic reflex direction", "vision problem detection", "visual function clinical assessment", "visual function measurement", "visual stimuli", "Cameras", "Face", "Feature extraction", "Image edge detection", "Tracking", "Visualization", "Eye tracking", "eye tracking, head tracking", "head tracking", "optokinetic nystagmus", "pupil/iris detection", "video stabilization", ""], "arnumber": "7055238"}
