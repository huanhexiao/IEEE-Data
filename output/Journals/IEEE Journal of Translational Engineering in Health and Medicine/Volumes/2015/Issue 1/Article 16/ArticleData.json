Both intraobserver and interobserver assessments were conducted to investigate whether the values of harmonics are stable in successive measurements. An intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and a Bland-Altman plot were used for this purpose. For the reliability assessments of the intraobserver and the interobserver, 22 subjects (mean age 45 \u00b1 14 years; 14 males and 8 females) were enrolled. The first eleven harmonics of the radial pulse wave presented excellent repeatability (ICCs > 0.9 and p <; 0.001) for the intraobserver assessment and high reproducibility (ICCs range from 0.83 to 0.96 and p <; 0.001) for the interobserver assessment. The Bland-Altman plot indicated that more than 90% of harmonic values fell within two standard deviations of the mean difference. Thus, we concluded that the harmonic analysis of the radial pulse wave using the TD01C system is a feasible and reliable method to assess a hemodynamic characteristic in clinical trial.", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "6", "date_publication": "Wed Oct 14 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "inspec": "15623152", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Wed Dec 02 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issn": "2168-2372"}, "authors": ["Chi-Wei Chang", "Jiang-Ming Chen", "Wei-Kung Wang"], "keywords": ["biomedical measurement", "haemodynamics", "harmonic analysis", "reliability", "Bland-Altman plot", "TD01C system", "harmonic wave analysis", "healthy humans", "hemodynamic characteristic", "intraclass correlation coefficient", "intraobserver assessment", "radial pulse wave measurement", "reliability", "reliability assessments", "standard deviations", "Blood pressure", "Correlation coefficient", "Harmonic analysis", "Observers", "Pulse measurements", "Reliability", "Standards", "Harmonic analysis", "blood pressure", "harmonic analysis", "radial pulse wave", "reliability", ""], "arnumber": "7298395"}
