The proposed modeling approach utilizes the concept of principal dynamic modes (PDMs) and their associated nonlinear functions (ANF) and hypothesizes that the ANFs of some PDMs for the AD patients will be distinct from their counterparts in control subjects. To this purpose, global PDMs are extracted from 1-min EEG signals of 17 AD patients and 24 control subjects at rest using Volterra models estimated via Laguerre expansions, whereby the O1 or O2 recording is viewed as the input signal and the F3 or F4 recording as the output signal. Subsequent singular value decomposition of the estimated Volterra kernels yields the global PDMs that represent an efficient basis of functions for the representation of the EEG dynamics in all subjects. The respective ANFs are computed for each subject and characterize the specific dynamics of each subject. For comparison, signal features traditionally used in the analysis of EEG signals in AD are computed as benchmark. The results indicate that the ANFs of two specific PDMs, corresponding to the delta-theta and alpha bands, can delineate the two groups well.", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "10", "date_publication": "Thu Feb 05 00:00:00 EST 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "inspec": "14945204", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Mon Feb 23 00:00:00 EST 2015", "issn": "2168-2372"}, "authors": ["Yue Kang", "Javier Escudero", "Dae Shin", "Emmanuel Ifeachor", "Vasilis Marmarelis"], "keywords": ["Volterra series", "diseases", "electroencephalography", "feature extraction", "medical signal processing", "patient diagnosis", "singular value decomposition", "stochastic processes", "time series", "ANF", "Alzheimer's disease diagnosis", "EEG", "F3 recording", "F4 recording", "Laguerre expansions", "O1 recording", "O2 recording", "PDM", "Volterra models", "alpha bands", "associated nonlinear functions", "delta-theta bands", "frontal electroencephalogram", "occipital electroencephalogram", "principal dynamic mode analysis", "principal dynamic modes", "signal features", "singular value decomposition", "time-series recordings", "Brain models", "Computational modeling", "Diseases", "Electroencephalography", "Kernel", "Predictive models", "Alzheimer???s disease", "EEG signal processing", "assistive diagnosis", "nonlinear modeling", ""], "arnumber": "7031860"}
