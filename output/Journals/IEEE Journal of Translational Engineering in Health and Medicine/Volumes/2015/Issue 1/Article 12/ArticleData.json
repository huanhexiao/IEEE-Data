Sensors embedded in the environment capture behavior and activity patterns. Changes in patterns are detected as potential signs of changing health. We first present results of a preliminary study investigating 22 features extracted from in-home sensor data. A 1-D alert algorithm was then implemented to generate health alerts to clinicians in a senior housing facility. Clinicians analyze each alert and provide a rating on the clinical relevance. These ratings are then used as ground truth for training and testing classifiers. Here, we present the methodology for four classification approaches that fuse multisensor data. Results are shown using embedded sensor data and health alert ratings collected on 21 seniors over nine months. The best results show similar performance for two techniques, where one approach uses only domain knowledge and the second uses supervised learning for training. Finally, we propose a health change detection model based on these results and clinical expertise. The system of in-home sensors and algorithms for automated health alerts provides a method for detecting health problems very early so that early treatment is possible. This method of passive in-home sensing alleviates compliance issues.", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "11", "date_publication": "Fri Apr 10 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "inspec": "15069954", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Tue Apr 21 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issn": "2168-2372"}, "authors": ["Marjorie Skubic", "Rainer Dane Guevara", "Marilyn Rantz"], "keywords": ["home computing", "learning (artificial intelligence)", "medical computing", "patient monitoring", "pattern classification", "telemedicine", "1-D alert algorithm", "classification approach", "classifier", "domain knowledge", "embedded health assessment", "embedded sensor data", "fuse multisensor data", "health alert automation", "health alert rating", "health change detection model", "health problem detection", "in-home sensor data", "supervised learning", "time 9 month", "Biomedical monitoring", "Data mining", "Electronic mail", "Feature extraction", "Monitoring", "Sensors", "Testing", "Behavioral bio-markers", "behavioral bio-markers", "eldercare monitoring", "health alerts", "in-home sensing", ""], "arnumber": "7084165"}
