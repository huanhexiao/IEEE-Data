The Artemis project aims to achieve the above goals in the area of neonatal ICUs (NICU). In this paper, we proposed an analytical model for the Artemis cloud project which will be deployed at McMaster Children's Hospital in Hamilton. We collect not only physiological data but also the infusion pumps data that are attached to NICU beds. Using the proposed analytical model, we predict the amount of storage, memory, and computation power required for the system. Capacity planning and tradeoff analysis would be more accurate and systematic by applying the proposed analytical model in this paper. Numerical results are obtained using real inputs acquired from McMaster Children's Hospital and a pilot deployment of the system at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto.", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "3", "lastpage": "9", "date_publication": "Thu Oct 01 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "inspec": "15511123", "date": "2015", "date_current_version": "Fri Oct 16 00:00:00 EDT 2015", "issn": "2168-2372"}, "authors": ["Hamzeh Khazaei", "Nadja Mench-Bressan", "Carolyn McGregor", "James Edward Pugh"], "keywords": ["bioinformatics", "cloud computing", "diseases", "paediatrics", "patient care", "Artemis cloud project", "NICU beds", "analytical modeling perspective", "capacity planning", "cloud-based health analytics solutions", "computation power", "condition onset detection", "disease prevention", "health informatics", "infusion pumps", "memory power", "neonatal intensive care units", "physiological data", "storage power", "tradeoff analysis", "Analytical models", "Biomedical monitoring", "Computational modeling", "Hospitals", "Monitoring", "Pediatrics", "Real-time systems", "Health informatics", "analytical modeling", "capacity planning", "cloud computing", "data management", "health informatics", "real-time analytics", ""], "arnumber": "7286745"}
