The results of such analyses are, however, strongly related to content, and may be language- and culture-dependent. Little attention has been paid to a pure measure of the form of speech, unrelated to its content: inter-words time intervals. Method: 15 patients with schizophrenia and 15 healthy volunteers are recorded spontaneously speaking for 10-15 min. Recordings are analyzed for inter-words time intervals using the following nonlinear dynamical methods: unstable periodic orbits, correlation dimension, bi-spectral analysis, and symbolic dynamics. Results: The series of inter-word time intervals in normal speech have the characteristics of a low-dimensional chaotic attractor with a correlation dimension of 3.2 \u00b1 1.1. Deconstruction of the attractor appears in psychosis with re-establishment after anti-psychotic treatment. Shannon entropy, a measure of the complexity in the time series, calculated from symbolic dynamics, is higher for psychotic speech, which is also characterized by higher levels of phase coupling: higher bicoherence, obtained using bi-spectral analysis. Conclusion: Non-linear dynamical methods applied to ITIs thus enable a content-independent, pure measure of the form of normal thought, its distortion in psychosis, and its restoration under treatment.", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "firstpage": "2200107", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "2200107", "date_publication": "2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "inspec": "13730799", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Fri Jul 12 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issn": "2168-2372"}, "authors": ["Doron Todder", "Sofia Avissar", "Gabriel Schreiber"], "keywords": ["chaos", "information theory", "medical disorders", "nonlinear dynamical systems", "psychology", "spectral analysis", "speech processing", "time series", "Shannon entropy", "antipsychotic treatment", "bicoherence", "bispectral analysis", "correlation dimension", "deconstruction", "interword time intervals", "invariably focusing", "low-dimensional chaotic attractor", "nonlinear dynamical methods", "phase coupling", "psychotic speech", "schizophrenia", "speech processes", "symbolic dynamics", "time series", "vocal signals", "Cognition", "Entropy", "Neuroscience", "Schizophrenia", "Speech processing", "Speech synthesis", "Time series analysis", "Schizophrenia", "cognitive neuroscience", "inter-words time intervals (ITIs)", "nonlinear dynamics", "psychotic speech", "speech form", ""], "arnumber": "6558536"}
