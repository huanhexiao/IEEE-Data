It is considered a significant untraditional method of human computer interaction. Head movement detection has also received researchers' attention and interest as it has been found to be a simple and effective interaction method. Both technologies are considered the easiest alternative interface methods. They serve a wide range of severely disabled people who are left with minimal motor abilities. For both eye tracking and head movement detection, several different approaches have been proposed and used to implement different algorithms for these technologies. Despite the amount of research done on both technologies, researchers are still trying to find robust methods to use effectively in various applications. This paper presents a state-of-art survey for eye tracking and head movement detection methods proposed in the literature. Examples of different fields of applications for both technologies, such as human-computer interaction, driving assistance systems, and assistive technologies are also investigated.", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "firstpage": "2100212", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "2100212", "date_publication": "Wed Nov 06 00:00:00 EST 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "inspec": "13914133", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Nov 14 00:00:00 EST 2013", "issn": "2168-2372"}, "authors": ["Amer Al-Rahayfeh", "Miad Faezipour"], "keywords": ["biomechanics", "electro-oculography", "human computer interaction", "medical signal processing", "driving assistance systems", "effective interaction method", "electrooculography", "eye tracking detection", "eye-gaze detection", "head movement detection", "human-computer interaction", "minimal motor abilities", "signal processing", "simple interaction method", "state-of-art survey", "Accuracy", "Cameras", "Classification algorithms", "Eye tracking", "Head movement", "Real-time systems", "Tracking", "Eye tracking", "eye detection", "head movement detection", ""], "arnumber": "6656866"}
