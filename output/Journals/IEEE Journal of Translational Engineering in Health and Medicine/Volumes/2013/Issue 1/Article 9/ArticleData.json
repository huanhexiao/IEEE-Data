Many telemedicine systems based on ubiquitous computing and communication techniques have been proposed for monitoring the user's electrocardiogram (ECG) anywhere and anytime. Usually, wet electrodes are used in these telemedicine systems. However, wet electrodes require conduction gels and skin preparation that can be inconvenient and uncomfortable for users. In order to overcome this issue, a new non-contact electrode circuit was proposed and applied in developing a mobile electrocardiogram monitoring system. The proposed non-contact electrode can measure bio-potentials across thin clothing, allowing it to be embedded in a user's normal clothing to monitor ECG in daily life. We attempted to simplify the design of these non-contact electrodes to reduce power consumption while continuing to provide good signal quality. The electrical specifications and the performance of monitoring arrhythmia in clinical settings were also validated to investigate the reliability of the proposed design. Experimental results show that the proposed non-contact electrode provides good signal quality for measuring ECG across thin clothes.", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "firstpage": "1", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "8", "date_publication": "2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "inspec": "13539225", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Tue Jun 04 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issn": "2168-2372"}, "authors": ["Bor-Shyh Lin", "Willy Chou", "Hsing-Yu Wang", "Yan-Jun Huang", "Jeng-Shyang Pan"], "keywords": ["bioelectric potentials", "biomedical electrodes", "cardiovascular system", "diseases", "electrocardiography", "medical signal processing", "mobile computing", "patient monitoring", "reliability", "telemedicine", "arrhythmia monitoring", "biopotentials", "cardiac health", "cardiovascular disease", "electrical specifications", "mobile electrocardiogram monitoring system", "noncontact electrode circuit", "power consumption reduction", "reliability", "signal quality", "telemedicine systems", "thin clothing", "ubiquitous communication techniques", "ubiquitous computing techniques", "Arrhythmia", "Cardiology", "Electrocardiography", "Mobile communication", "Real-time systems", "Telemedicine", "Arrhythmia", "electrocardiogram (ECG)", "mobile electrocardiogram monitoring system", "non-contact electrode", "telemedicine", ""], "arnumber": "6523100"}
