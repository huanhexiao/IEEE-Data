But reliable determination of vital signs at home requires new, smart sensors, which can be used by the patients themselves. We present a novel pulse oximetry sensor worn in the ear channel. It was previously shown that measurement of heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation and related respiratory information can be performed with reliable accuracy under laboratory conditions. The present study explores the clinical feasibility of the sensor system for cardiovascular monitoring during sleep, with the aim to diagnose sleep apnea. For this, human trials were performed in a sleep laboratory including patients with a clinical suspicion of sleep apnea. Besides a general analysis of the sensor's signal quality during sleep, the evaluation focuses on heart rate dynamics and time-variant oxygen saturation. In addition, several methods to derive respiration rate from photoplethysmographic signals are examined and discussed. Results from the in-ear sensor are compared with standard polysomnography monitoring and demonstrate that this novel system allows long-term nocturnal measurement of heart rate, oxygen saturation and respiratory rate with sufficient accuracy.", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "firstpage": "2700208", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "2700208", "date_publication": "Thu Aug 08 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "inspec": "13739153", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Sep 05 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issn": "2168-2372"}, "authors": ["Boudewijn Venema", "Johannes Schiefer", "Vladimir Blazek", "Nikolai Blanik", "Steffen Leonhardt"], "keywords": ["assisted living", "cardiovascular system", "ear", "haemodynamics", "intelligent sensors", "oximetry", "patient monitoring", "photoplethysmography", "pneumodynamics", "sleep", "arterial oxygen saturation", "care-delivery", "clinical feasibility", "healthcare", "heart rate dynamics", "homecare", "in-ear sensor", "innovative in-ear pulse oximetry", "long-term nocturnal measurement", "outpatient before inpatient principle", "photoplethysmographic signals", "pulmonary monitoring", "pulse oximetry sensor", "respiration rate", "respiratory information", "sensor signal quality", "sleep apnea", "sleep laboratory", "smart sensors", "standard polysomnography monitoring", "time-variant oxygen saturation", "unobtrusive cardiovascular monitoring", "vital signs", "Biomedical monitoring", "Heart rate", "Photoplethysmography", "Pulse measurements", "Sleep apnea", "Photoplethysmography (PPG)", "blood volume dynamics", "oxygen saturation", "pulse oximetry", "sleep apnea", ""], "arnumber": "6576858"}
