Together, over the course of a single semester, seniors, graduate students, and clinicians conceive, design, build, and test proof-of-concept prototypes. Projects initiated in the course have generated intellectual property and peer-reviewed publications, stimulated further research, furthered student and clinician careers, and resulted in technology licenses and start-up ventures.", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "firstpage": "4700107", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "4700107", "date_publication": "Wed Jul 24 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "inspec": "13689004", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Aug 15 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issn": "2168-2372"}, "authors": ["Nevan C.
