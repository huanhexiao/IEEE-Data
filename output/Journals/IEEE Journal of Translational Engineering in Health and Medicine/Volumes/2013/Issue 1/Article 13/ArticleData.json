Modification of the score to reflect local disease burden is discussed, as are its intended interpretations. Extensive data collection on up-to-date equipment and personnel resources must be undertaken before the MTS can become useful as a policy-relevant tool.", "journal_title": "IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine", "firstpage": "3700105", "volume": "1", "lastpage": "3700105", "date_publication": "2013", "sponsor": "IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society", "inspec": "13631979", "date": "2013", "date_current_version": "Thu Jul 18 00:00:00 EDT 2013", "issn": "2168-2372"}, "authors": ["Olumurejiwa A.
